Participants can submit at most three runs for evaluation.

Participants are also required to submit answers and evaluation
results of past three years' formal run settings, i.e. using each of
the past three years' datasets (H30, R01, R02) as test datasets, older
years' datasets (-H29, -H30, -R01) as training datasets.

If this is not realistic due to e.g. the training time, please consult
the task organizers.

Followings are example file list for submission. When you submit three
runs whose submission ID is H1, H2, and H3, you are requested to
submit following 13 files including reference results for older test
settings and system description.

# These three files for the final results.
R06.task4.H1 for Final submission for TestData_{jp,en}.xml
R06.task4.H2 for Final submission for TestData_{jp,en}.xml
R06.task4.H3 for Final submission for TestData_{jp,en}.xml
