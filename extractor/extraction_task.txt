1. ANGELIC Structure (Articles 565 & 566)

Links Between Factors (Support or Attack)
	•	B1 → Supports → A1
	◦	Non-conforming right supports the abstract factor “Non-Conformity of Right.”
	•	B2 → Supports → A1
	◦	Partial right from a third party also supports “Non-Conformity of Right.”
	•	B3 → Supports → A2
	◦	Goods that do not match kind or quality support “Non-Conformity of Goods.”
	•	B4 → Attacks → A3
	◦	If the buyer fails to notify in time, that attacks the factor “Timely Notice or Seller’s Knowledge.”
	•	B5 → Attacks → B4 (indirectly supporting A3)
	◦	If the seller knew or was grossly negligent, it overrides the buyer’s failure to notify and thus supports the buyer’s ability to claim remedies.
Root Node Logic:
	•	Buyer is entitled to remedies if A1 or A2 is established (i.e., some non-conformity), and A3 is not negated by B4 (unless overridden by B5).

Converts the above angelic structure into the below ASP:
sup(bfactor(1), afactor(1)).
sup(bfactor(2), afactor(1)).
sup(bfactor(3), afactor(2)).
atk(bfactor(4), afactor(3)).
atk(bfactor(5), bfactor(4)).
sup(afactor(1), root(0)).
sup(afactor(2), root(0)).
atk(afactor(3), root(0)).
sup(query, bfactor(0)).
