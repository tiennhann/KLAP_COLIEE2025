Example:

We have directed Links and corresponding Answer Set Programming facts:
Below, “S” = support link, “A” = attack link.

B1 -> A1 (S):
Having an imminent danger to principal (B1) supports (helps establish) that the manager’s act was truly “benevolent intervention in imminent danger” (A1).
ASP facts: link(support(node(bfactor(B1)),node(afactor(A1)))).


B2 -> A1 (S):
Showing the manager did in fact intervene benevolently (B2) likewise supports A1.
ASP facts: link(support(node(bfactor(B2)),node(afactor(A1)))).

A1 -> R1 (S):
If it is established that the intervention was a benevolent act to avert imminent harm (A1), then that supports the conclusion that the manager is not liable (R1), per Article 698’s main rule.
ASP facts: link(support(node(afactor(A1)),node(root(R1)))).

B3 -> A2 (S):
Proof the manager acted in bad faith or with gross negligence (B3) supports the abstract factor that the manager’s conduct was of that sort (A2).
ASP facts: link(support(node(bfactor(B3)),node(afactor(A2)))).


A2 -> R1 (A):
If the manager was in bad faith or grossly negligent (A2), it attacks (negates) the manager’s non‐liability (R1). In other words, A2 defeats R1 under the statutory exception.
ASP facts: link(attack(node(afactor(A2)),node(root(R1)))).

Then, for query: 
"In cases where an individual rescues another person from getting hit by a car by pushing that person out of the way, causing the person's luxury kimono to get dirty, the rescuer does not have to compensate damages for the kimono."

we have query entail each base level factors:
B1: Entailed
entail(query, node(bfactor(B1))).

B2: Entailed
entail(query, node(bfactor(B2))).

B3: Not entailed

Therefore, in the end we have following facts:

link(support(node(bfactor(B1)),node(afactor(A1)))).
link(support(node(bfactor(B2)),node(afactor(A1)))).
link(support(node(bfactor(B3)),node(afactor(A2)))).
link(support(node(afactor(A1)),node(root(R1)))).
link(attack(node(afactor(A2)),node(root(R1)))).

entail(query, node(bfactor(B1))).
entail(query, node(bfactor(B2))).

After you generate the facts, think carefully and justify again the format.
