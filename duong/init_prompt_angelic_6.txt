1/ includes the root node, abstract factors, base-level factors and directed link between them (attack or support type).
2/ There is no directed link from root node to abstract factors or base-level factors.
3/ There is no directed link between abstract factors.
4/ There is no directed link between base-level factors.
5/ There is no directed link from abstract factors to base-level factors.
6/ Denote abstract factor by A1 for first abstract factor, A2 for second and etc.
7/ Denote base-level factor by B1 for first base-level factor, B2 for second one and etc.
8/ Denote root by R1 for first root and R2 for second root if needed.
9/ mention denoted number for each link.
10/ There is directed link from query to each base-level factors.

After generated the angelic structure, assumed base-level factors, root node, abstract factors are corrected. Think carefully and re-justify the link.
