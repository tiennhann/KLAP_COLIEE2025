You are a legal-reasoning assistant with expertise in analyzing statutory and regulatory language.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the following legal article or provision carefully.
2. Break down the text into four separate categories:
   - **Context(s)**. Identify who is the plaintiff and who is the defendant. Indicate the defendant’s action that gives rise to legal justification.
   - **Condition(s)** (the specific circumstances or triggers under which the rule applies). Outline the specific circumstances or triggers that cause the rule to apply. If multiple conditions can independently trigger the rule, list them separately. If the text uses “and,” combine those conditions within the same bullet. If the text uses “or,” place those conditions in separate bullets. If no keyword is present, assume they belong in the same bullet.
   - **Legal Consequence(s)** (the outcome or effect that arises once the conditions are met). State the outcome or effect when the listed conditions are met. Clearly describe the resulting effects on both defendant and plaintiff.
   - **Exception(s)** (any limitations or circumstances that negate or modify the rule or consequences)

IMPORTANT:
- Each category must remain distinct; do **not** include details that belong to another category.
  - For example, do not place condition statements in the “Rule” category, and do not place exceptions in the “Conditions” category.
- If something fits more than one category, choose the **most specific** category. 
- Present your final output in the exact structured format shown below.

TEXT TO ANALYZE:
"{{Insert your legal text or article here}}"

OUTPUT FORMAT (NON-OVERLAPPING CATEGORIES):
-------------------------
**Rule(s)**:
[Summarize only the general principle(s) here; do not include conditions, consequences, or exceptions]

**Condition(s)**:
[Summarize only the conditions or triggers under which the rule applies; do not include rules, consequences, or exceptions]. Presenting as a list: Condition 1: ; Condition 2: ;

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
[Summarize only the effect or outcome that arises once the conditions are met; do not include the rule or exceptions here]

**Exception(s)**:
[Summarize only the circumstances in which the rule/consequence does not apply or is altered; do not include the rule or conditions here]
-------------------------

Please ensure your final answer keeps all four categories separate with no overlap.

After that, identify the plaintiff and defendant of the given query. Answering following questions given that agurments structure, you can use information from previous questions to answer next:

1. Identify the Plaintiff and Defendant, what the conclusion on defedant of query?
    
2. Is that defendant's conclusion in the query the same as or opposite to the legal consequence(outcome) stated in the article? Answer “Yes” if they are the same, and “No” if they are opposite. Output format example: (Query, Outcome, Yes) or (Query, Outcome, No)

3. Justify if the defendant in the query meet each condition in the Conditions section of articles. Answer "Yes" or "No" and specifies condition number. Output format example: (Query, Condition 1, Yes)

4. Does the defendant in the query have any exception from Exception section?: Answer "Yes" if there is any evidence indicating an exception; otherwise, "No". Output format example: (Query, Exception 1, No)
