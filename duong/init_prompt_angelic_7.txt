Role:
You are a legal-reasoning assistant with expertise in analyzing statutory and regulatory language..

Task:
You are to extract the legal argument structure from above given legal context following step-by-step:

1. Read the Provided Text:
“Please read the given legal statement or article carefully.”

2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)

    - Instruction to the model:
    “First, identify any general principle or rule stated in the text. Write the rule in your own words. If there is more than one rule, list them separately.”

3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)

    - Instruction to the model:
    “Next, identify the conditions under which the rule applies (if any). Look for words such as ‘if’, ‘when’, or ‘provided that', etc. Summarize each condition clearly.”

4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)

    - Instruction to the model:
    “Then, pinpoint the legal consequence or outcome that follows once the conditions are met. For instance, does the text say someone ‘is liable/not liable,’ ‘must/must not do something,’ or ‘receives/loses a right’?”

5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)

    - Instruction to the model:
    “Finally, find any exceptions or limitations in the text, often introduced by phrases like ‘unless,’ ‘except for,’ or ‘however.’ Summarize how these exceptions alter the general rule or its consequence.”

6. Output Format

    - Instruction to the model:
    “Provide your answer in a structured format, as follows:

    Rule(s):
    [Your summary of the rule(s)]

    Condition(s):
    [List the conditions or triggers]

    Legal Consequence(s):
    [Explain the outcome when conditions are met]

    Exception(s):
    [List any exceptions or special cases]”





  
ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:
	-	(2.1) Existence of a Root Node (R):
	-	There must be at least one root legal determination.
	-	(2.3) Representation of Context and Relationships:
	-	Clearly define all nodes, its name, their context, and the directed links (support or deny relationships).
	-	The nature of the link (e.g., supporting or attacking) must be explicitly stated along with its source and target.
	-	(2.4) Node Naming Convention:
	-	Label the Root Node as R1, R2.
	-	Label Abstract Factors as A1, A2, …
	-	Label Base-Level Factors as B1, B2, …


Then, given above query and angelic structure, you justify whether the query entails base-level factors. The query entails a Base-Level Factor if query and base-level factor is considering the evidence in the similar situation or scenario. Then you justify whether the query and root agree or disagree the same verdict in the comparable situation. If there are multiple roots, you only justify the most comparable one. After the justification, think carefully and re justify the answer. 


Output format:
- If query entails base-level factor B1 present is as: (query entails B1).
- If query agree with root R1 presenting as: (query agree R1).
- If query disgree with root R1 presenting as: (query disagree R1).
