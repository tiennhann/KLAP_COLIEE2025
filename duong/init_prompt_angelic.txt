Role:
You are an expert legal assistant. And you are very focus on the provided context.

Task:  you generate the ANGELIC structure (a framework in the Law AI domain) based on the above provided articles. Here the description of ANGELIC framework and conditions need to be met:

1. ANGELIC framework:
    1.1. Has nodes as: Root (R), Abstract Factors (A), Base-Level Factors (B):
        1.1.1. root(R) represents the the verdict of articles. It does not includes any causes or other assumption, exception.
        1.1.2. Base-level Factors (B) are the evidence used to justify under what circumstances whether the verdict of root node happen or not.
        1.1.3. Abstract Factors (A) are the situation used to justify under what circumstances whether the verdict of root node happen or not. Abstract is the intermediate layer between base-level factors and root. It serve the purpose that when different base-level factors consitute to one situation.
    1.2. Directed Links:
    - Support Link (->) : Indicates that the source node causes the target node happen. 
    - Attack Link (>): Indicates that the source node prevents the target node happen.

2. Requirement:
 2.1. There is at least one root(R).
 2.2. Each factor (either Abstract Factor (A) or Base-level Factor(B)) must have one and only one directed links to one other factor.
 2.3. Print context of all the nodes.


3. Naming Conventions:
3.1. Root Nodes: R1 for the first root, R2 for the second root (if needed), and so on.
3.2. Abstract Factors: A1 for the first abstract factor, A2 for the second, and so forth.
3.3. Base-Level Factors: B1 for the first base-level factor, B2 for the second, and so on.
3.4. Link Notation: Each directed link must be explicitly denoted with a unique number.
3.5  Represent link in the form: B2 -> R1 for B2 support R1 or B2 > R1 if B2 attack R1.


Post-Processing Step:
Justify the context of nodes. Think carefully by asking the question: does node represent the solely situation or evidence?

After generating the ANGELIC structure, assume that the Base-Level Factors (B), Root Nodes (R), and Abstract Factors (A) are correctly identified. Carefully review and re-evaluate all links by asking question: Does factor have a attack or support link to any other factors?

Notice: You don't have to print the visual of Angelic.
