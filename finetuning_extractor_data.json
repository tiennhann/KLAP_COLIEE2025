[{"chat": "To construct the Angelic structure based on the provided legal provisions and the given query, I'll follow the steps:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)**\n\nThe root node of the article seeks to establish or refute the legal conclusion that a minor's acceptance of gifts without burden is not rescindable. The exact determination is:\n\n\"The legal conclusion is that a minor's acceptance of gifts without burden cannot be rescinded.\"\n\n**Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)**\n\nThe abstract factors are:\n\n1. A1: Minor has consented to perform a juridical act (accepting gifts without burden)\n2. A2: Minor was not in contravention of the provisions of Article 5 regarding minors' capacity to enter into juridical acts\n\n**Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B)**\n\nBased on the abstract factors, I refine them into base-level factors:\n\n1. B1: The minor has given their consent to accept gifts without burden.\n2. B2: The minor was not in contravention of Article 5's provisions regarding minors' capacity to enter into juridical acts.\n\n**Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)**\n\nBased on the refined base-level factors, I establish directed links:\n\n1. A1 supports R1 (the root node). This means that if a minor has given their consent to accept gifts without burden, it supports the conclusion that their acceptance cannot be rescinded.\n2. B1 supports A1. This means that if the minor has given their consent, it supports the fact that they have performed a juridical act (accepting gifts without burden).\n3. B2 denies A1. This means that if the minor was not in contravention of Article 5's provisions regarding minors' capacity to enter into juridical acts, it undermines the fact that they gave their consent.\n\n**Angellic Structure Formation:**\n\nRoot Node (R):\n- R1: The legal conclusion is that a minor's acceptance of gifts without burden cannot be rescinded.\n\nAbstract Factors:\n- A1: Minor has consented to perform a juridical act (accepting gifts without burden)\n- A2: Minor was not in contravention of the provisions of Article 5 regarding minors' capacity to enter into juridical acts\n\nBase-Level Factors:\n- B1: The minor has given their consent to accept gifts without burden.\n- B2: The minor was not in contravention of Article 5's provisions regarding minors' capacity to enter into juridical acts.\n\nDirected Links:\n- (B2 supports A1)\n- (A1 supports R1)\n- (B1 supports A1)\n\nNow, justifying whether the query entails base-level factors:\n\nThe query states that acceptance made by a minor that received an offer of gifts without burden without getting consent from their statutory agent may not be rescinded. This query is considering the evidence in similar situations or scenarios, as it's analyzing the minor's capacity to enter into juridical acts and their consent in accepting gifts without burden.\n\nTherefore, I re-justify my answer:\n\n(query entails B1)\n\nThe query involves a base-level factor (B1) that considers the minor's consent in accepting gifts without burden, which is similar to the refined base-level factor.", "extracted": "link(support(node(bfactor(1)),node(root(1)))).entail(query, node(bfactor(1)))."}, {"chat": "To construct the Angelic structure based on the provided legal provisions and the query, I will follow the step-by-step approach.\n\n**Root Node (R):**\nThe article seeks to establish that a minor's capacity to act in relation to their business is equivalent to an adult's capacity. The root conclusion is: \"A minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned.\"\n\n**Abstract Factors (A):**\nThe key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion are:\n\n1. Permission from a statutory agent\n2. Ability to sustain the business\n3. Capacity to perform acts unrelated to the business\n\nThese abstract factors underpin the root conclusion and will be further refined into base-level factors if necessary.\n\n**Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B):**\nIn this case, the abstract factors are already quite specific and do not encompass multiple legal scenarios. Therefore, no further refinement is necessary.\n\n**Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**\n\n1. **Permission from a statutory agent**: Supports R1 (minor's capacity to act in relation to their business).\n\t* Source: Article 6(1)\n\t* Target: R1\n2. **Ability to sustain the business**: Denies A1 (minor's ability to sustain the business)\n\t* Source: Article 6(2)(1)\n\t* Target: A1\n3. **Capacity to perform acts unrelated to the business**: Attacking R1 (minor's capacity to act in relation to their business) through the grounds that make the minor unable to sustain the business.\n\t* Source: Article 6(2)(2)\n\t* Target: R1\n\nThe links are:\n\n- Permission from a statutory agent supports the minor's capacity to act.\n- Ability to sustain the business undermines the minor's ability to sustain the business, which in turn undermines their capacity to act.\n- Capacity to perform acts unrelated to the business is not explicitly stated as supporting or denying the minor's capacity to act.\n\n**Justification:**\nThe query asks whether a minor who performs an act unrelated to their business without getting consent from their statutory agent can have that act rescinded. This scenario does not directly address the root conclusion (R1) but rather the abstract factor A2 (Ability to sustain the business). The query is more focused on the minor's capacity to perform acts unrelated to their business.\n\nHowever, if we consider the query as asking about the minor's capacity to act in relation to their business, it can be seen as indirectly related to R1 through the ability to sustain the business. In this context, I would argue that the query does not directly entail a base-level factor.\n\n**Re-Justification:**\nUpon further consideration, I realize that my initial justification was overly narrow. The query is more closely related to the abstract factors than initially thought. Specifically, it touches on the grounds that make the minor unable to sustain their business (Article 6(2)(1) and (2)).\n\nIn this sense, the query does entail a base-level factor: \"Ability to sustain the business\" (B1). The query is essentially asking whether an act unrelated to the business can be rescinded in a scenario where the minor's ability to sustain the business is compromised. This means that B1 (ability to sustain the business) is being tested in a specific context, making it a base-level factor.\n\nTherefore, I re-justify my answer:\n\n(query entails B1)\n\nThis means that the query does entail a base-level factor related to the minor's ability to sustain their business.", "extracted": "entail(query, node(bfactor(1)))."}, {"chat": "Based on the provided Article 9 and query, I will construct the Angelic structure.\n\n**Root Node (R):**\nThe root legal conclusion or verdict established by Article 9 is that a juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable, except in cases of purchasing daily necessities.\n\n**Abstract Factor (A):**\nThe key legal factor that substantiates this conclusion is that the act was performed by an adult ward.\n\n**Refined Abstract Factors (B) into Base-Level Factors:**\nFurther refining the abstract factor, we can identify two distinct base-level factors:\n\n1. **Adult Ward**: The fact that the person performing the act is an adult ward.\n2. **Purchase of Daily Necessities**: The specific nature of the act being performed.\n\n**Directed Links (Support or Deny):**\n\n* Abstract Factor A: \"The act was performed by an adult ward\" supports Base-Level Factor 1: \"Adult Ward\".\n* Abstract Factor A: \"The act was performed by an adult ward\" supports Base-Level Factor 2: \"Purchase of Daily Necessities\".\n* Abstract Factor A: \"The act was performed by an adult ward\" denies Base-Level Factor 3: \"Not an Adult Ward\".\n\n**Angelics Structure Formation:**\n\nRoot Node (R): R1 - Juridical Act Performed by Adult Ward is Voidable\n\nAbstract Factors:\n\nA1: The act was performed by an adult ward.\n- Denies B3: Not an Adult Ward\n- Supports B2: Purchase of Daily Necessities\n- Supports B1: Adult Ward\n\nBase-Level Factors:\nB1: Adult Ward\n- Supported by A1: \"The act was performed by an adult ward\"\n- Denied by none\n\nB2: Purchase of Daily Necessities\n- Supported by A1: \"The act was performed by an adult ward\"\n- Denied by R1 (Juridical Act Performed by Adult Ward is Voidable)\n\nB3: Not an Adult Ward\n- Attacked by A1: \"The act was performed by an adult ward\"\n\n**Justification for Query Entailing Base-Level Factor B2:**\n\nUpon analyzing the query, it becomes evident that the purchase of daily household items may not be rescinded, even if an adult ward performed the act. This implies that the purchase of daily necessities is a specific exception to the voidability of the juridical act.\n\nIn this scenario, the query directly relates to the base-level factor \"Purchase of Daily Necessities\" (B2), as it highlights the exception to the general rule established by Article 9.\n\nTherefore, I rejustify that the query entails Base-Level Factor B2:", "extracted": " entail(query, node(bfactor(3))).link(support(node(bfactor(3)),node(root(1)))).link(support(node(bfactor(3)),node(afactor(2)))).link(support(node(bfactor(3)),node(root(1))))."}, {"chat": "To construct the Angelic structure based on the provided legal provisions, I will follow the steps outlined above.\n\n**Root Node (R):**\nThe root legal determination sought to be established or refuted by Article 13 is: \"A person under curatorship must obtain the consent of the curator in order to perform certain acts.\"\n\n**Derived Abstract Factors (A):**\n\n1. **Consent Requirement**: The act of obtaining consent from the curator is a key factor.\n2. **Act Type**: The type of act that requires consent is specified, such as receiving property, borrowing money, or performing an act regarding immovables.\n\n**Refined Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**\n\n1. **Consent for Receiving Property**\n2. **Consent for Borrowing Money**\n3. **Consent for Performing Act Regarding Immovables**\n4. **Consent for Suing a Procedural Act**\n5. **Consent for Giving a Gift or Entering into an Arbitration Agreement**\n\nThese refined abstract factors are distinct base-level factors that directly apply to specific conditions.\n\n**Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**\n\n1.

However, they can be rephrased to better capture the essence of each factor:\n\n1. A manager intentionally disregards the other's business for personal gain or benefit.\n2.
