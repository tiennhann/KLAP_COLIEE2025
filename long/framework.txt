# SUMMARY OF ADFs
The Abstract Dialetical Framework is way to represent law articles into a mathematical structure. 
Each law article is comprised of:
1. 1 or more outcomes: the outcome(s) of the article. 
2. Factors: events, conditions, or things that cause the outcome(s) as described in the article. 
3. Links between the factors and outcomes representing the relationship between a factor and another factor (or outcome). Each factor either support (true) or attack (false) outcome(s) and/or factor(s).
## Mathematical Structure (ADF Structure):
1. The articles, outcomes, and factors form an acylic graph. Each of them is a node.
2. Each support/attack relationship between a factor and a factor or article is a link between the 2 nodes.
## Example 
Convert Article 1 ("Article 1
    (1) Private rights must be congruent with the public welfare.
    (2) The exercise of rights and performance of duties must be done in good faith.
    (3) Abuse of rights is not permitted.
") into a ADF Structure:
1. Outcomes":'article1_violated'
2. Factors":'private_rights_congruent_with_public_welfare','the_excersie_of_rights_done_in_good_faith','abuse_of_rights'
3. Links:('private_rights_congruent_with_public_welfare','attack','article1_violated'),('the excersie_of_rights_done_in_good_faith','attack','article1_violated'),('abuse_of_rights','support','article1_violated')
# Task definition
You will be given an "input_article", convert it to an ADF Structre.
