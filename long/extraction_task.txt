# SUMMARY OF ADMs 
The AMD framework is a method to represent law statements or articles in a structure.
Each law article is comprised of multiple factors that represent the concepts or issues in the article. 
The factors can have links that represents the relationship between factors in the article.  
A factor can also be represented as a conjunction of factors (AND) as conjunction(factor1, factor2,...)
Each link can be a support or attack link. Each link re presents a disjunction relationship (OR)
