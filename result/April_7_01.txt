### Begin Factoring
1. A manager's intervention in another's business must be benevolent.
2. The intervention aims to prevent imminent danger to the principal's person, reputation, or property.
3. The manager is not liable for damage resulting from the intervention unless they acted in bad faith or with gross negligence.
4. The context of the queries involves various scenarios of intervention and potential liability.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Now, let's analyze each query based on these factors:

1. **Query 1**: This scenario describes a situation where B intervenes in A's business by starting to repair A's hedge but ends up causing more damage (the hedge withers). The key issue here is whether B acted in bad faith or with gross negligence, which could make them liable for the damage. However, based on the information given, it seems that B's initial intention was benevolent (to help A by repairing the hedge), but the outcome was negative due to B leaving the repair unfinished. The article suggests that liability is primarily determined by bad faith or gross negligence. Without explicit evidence of these factors, the query leans towards suggesting no compensation is owed for the withered hedge due to the initial benevolent intent, aligning with the article's conditions under which a manager is not liable.

2. **Query 2**: This involves a physical rescue where one person pushes another out of the way of a car, resulting in damage to the rescued person's kimono. The scenario fits within the context of preventing imminent danger (to the person), and there's no indication that the rescuer acted in bad faith or with gross negligence. Thus, according to the article, the rescuer does not have to compensate for the damages to the kimono because their action was aimed at preventing a greater harm (physical injury) and presumably done without malice or negligence.

3. **Query 3**: This statement requires a manager to exercise care identical to that they would for their own property when managing another's business. The article does not explicitly state this requirement; it only discusses the conditions under which a manager is not liable for damages resulting from their intervention (benevolent intent and absence of bad faith or gross negligence). It implies a standard of care but does not mandate it to be the same as one would use for their own property. Therefore, this query does not logically follow from the article provided.

Based on the analysis:
- Query 1 seems plausible under certain interpretations (especially if B's actions are seen as benevolent without bad faith or gross negligence), so it could be considered valid in context.
- Query 2 directly aligns with the conditions outlined in the article for non-liability, making it a clear "Y".
- Query 3 introduces a requirement not explicitly covered by the article, leading to an "N".

Thus, the responses are:
- Query 1: N (due to the complexities and missing explicit evidence of bad faith or gross negligence)
- Query 2: Y
- Query 3: N
