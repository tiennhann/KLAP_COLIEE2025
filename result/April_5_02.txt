======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given problem, let's first factor the provided article into its key components to understand the legal context it establishes regarding minors and their ability to perform juridical acts. Then, we'll analyze the query in relation to these factors to determine if it logically follows from the article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Minors Need Consent**: A minor must obtain consent from their legal representative to perform a juridical act.
2. **Exception for Acquiring Rights or Being Released**: The requirement for consent does not apply when the juridical act is merely for acquiring a right or being released from an obligation.
3. **Voidable Acts**: Juridical acts performed by minors without necessary consent are voidable.
4. **Permission for Disposal**: If a legal representative permits a minor to dispose of property for a specified purpose (or without specifying a purpose), the minor can freely do so within the scope of that permission.

### End of Factoring

Given these factors, we now need to assess the query: "For given legal article and query pair below, please determine whether the query is legally valid with the context the article." However, there seems to be a misunderstanding because no specific query related to Article 5 is provided for evaluation. 

To follow the instructions accurately, I would need a specific query to evaluate against the factored components of Article 5. Without this query, it's not possible to determine its legal validity in relation to the article.

However, based on the requirement to provide an answer in the specified format and considering the absence of a specific query to evaluate:

<Number of factors : 4>

Given the lack of a specific query to assess against Article 5, I must highlight this omission rather than providing a "Y" or "N" response. Normally, to determine if a query is legally valid, one would compare its content against the factored components of the relevant legal article(s), identifying which factors are present or missing that could validate or invalidate the query in question. 

Since no actual query was provided for analysis, it's essential to note this gap rather than proceeding with an inaccurate assessment.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors derived from Article 5, we will consider all possible combinations of these factors that lead to a determinate outcome regarding the legal validity of a juridical act performed by a minor. The factors are:

1. **Minors Need Consent**
2. **Exception for Acquiring Rights or Being Released**
3. **Voidable Acts**
4. **Permission for Disposal**

Here are 10 case scenarios, each with a unique combination of these factors:

1. (1 | N) - In this scenario, the minor needs consent but does not obtain it. According to Article 5(1), the act is voidable as per Article 5(2), making it invalid.

2. (2 | Y) - The juridical act is for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation. As per Article 5(1), consent is not required in such cases, so the act is valid.

3. (3 | N) - The act is voidable because it was performed without necessary consent. Since it's voidable, it's considered invalid until validated by the legal representative or through other legal means.

4. (1, 2 | Y) - Although consent is generally needed for a minor to perform a juridical act, if the act is for acquiring a right or being released from an obligation, consent is not required, making the act valid.

5. (4 | Y) - The minor has permission from their legal representative to dispose of property. As per Article 5(3), within the scope of that permission, the minor can freely dispose of the property, making the act valid.

6. (1, 3 | N) - The minor did not obtain consent, and the act is voidable. This combination reaffirms that without consent, when required, the act's validity can be challenged, making it invalid.

7. (2, 4 | Y) - This scenario combines an exception for acquiring rights or being released from obligations with permission for disposal. Both factors independently support the validity of the juridical act under different conditions, so the act remains valid.

8. (3, 4 | Y) - Although the act might initially be considered voidable due to lack of consent, if the legal representative has given permission for the disposal (factor 4), it overrides the concern about voidability in this context, making the act valid within the scope of that permission.

9. (1, 2, 3 | N) - This scenario involves a need for consent, an exception to this rule, and the act being voidable. The presence of factor 3 (voidable acts) indicates a lack of proper consent when needed, which leans towards the act being invalid despite the exception.

10. (1, 2, 4 | Y) - This combination includes the need for consent, an exception to this need, and permission for disposal. Given that the legal representative has permitted the disposal (factor 4), and considering the act might fall under acquiring a right or being released from an obligation (factor 2), the specific need for consent (factor 1) is overridden by these more specific permissions and exceptions, making the act valid.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors that determine the legal validity of the juridical act based on Article 5's provisions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1 in the Query
The query discusses an acceptance made by a minor without getting consent from their statutory agent. This situation implies the minor is performing a juridical act (accepting gifts) without obtaining the necessary consent, which aligns with Factor 1: "Minors Need Consent". Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2 in the Query
The query mentions an offer of gifts without burden, which can be interpreted as acquiring a right (receiving a gift) or being released from an obligation. This scenario aligns with Factor 2: "Exception for Acquiring Rights or Being Released". Hence, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3 in the Query
The query states that the acceptance "may not be rescinded," which implies that despite the act being potentially voidable due to lack of consent (as per Factor 3: "Voidable Acts"), there's an assertion about its validity or enforceability. This discussion around rescission touches upon the concept of voidable acts, so (Query entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4 in the Query
There is no explicit mention in the query that the minor was permitted by their legal representative to dispose of property (or accept gifts) for a specified purpose or without specifying a purpose. This factor (Factor 4: "Permission for Disposal") does not seem directly relevant to the scenario described, as it focuses on the minor's ability to dispose of property rather than accept gifts. Therefore, (Query not entails 4).

## Step 5: Evaluating Query Validity
Given that the query touches upon aspects related to a minor's ability to perform juridical acts without consent and discusses the potential for these acts not being rescinded, it implies a certain level of validity or enforceability under specific conditions. However, according to Article 5, acts performed by minors without necessary consent are generally voidable (Paragraph 2). The query's statement that acceptance "may not be rescinded" could suggest an interpretation where the act is considered valid under certain conditions (like acquiring a right without burden), aligning with exceptions provided in the article. Therefore, considering the nuances and focusing strictly on the task's requirement for an assessment of validity based on the query's explicit expressions about legal validity, (Query Valid).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the given legal article, we first need to factor the article into its key components or factors. The article discusses the capacity of a minor to conduct business and the conditions under which their permission to do so can be revoked or limited.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Capacity of Minors**: A minor has the same capacity to act as an adult in permitted businesses.
2. **Permission for Business**: The permission for a minor to conduct one or multiple types of businesses is granted, implying there's an authority figure (like a legal representative) involved in granting such permissions.
3. **Grounds for Revocation/Limitation**: There are specific grounds that can make the minor unable to sustain the business, which may lead to the revocation or limitation of the permission by the legal representative.
4. **Involvement of Legal Representative**: The legal representative plays a role in granting, revoking, or limiting the permission for the minor to conduct businesses based on certain conditions.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given the query is not explicitly stated, I will create a hypothetical query to demonstrate how one might assess its validity against the article: "Can a legal representative revoke a minor's business permission if they deem it unsustainable?"

To answer this query, we refer back to the factors:
- The capacity of minors to act as adults in permitted businesses (Factor 1) suggests that once permitted, minors have significant autonomy.
- The involvement of a legal representative in granting permissions (Factor 2) and their role in potential revocation or limitation (Factor 4) implies they have oversight powers.
- The grounds for revocation/limitation (Factor 3) specifically mention the minor's inability to sustain the business as a reason for intervention by the legal representative.

Given these factors, the query about the legal representative's ability to revoke permission due to unsustainability **logically follows** from the conditions outlined in the article. Thus, if we were to answer based on this hypothetical query, the response would be "Y" because the article directly supports the notion that a legal representative can intervene under specific circumstances, such as the minor being unable to sustain the business.

However, without an explicit query provided in your prompt, I've created a scenario for demonstration purposes. If you provide the actual query related to Article 6, I could offer a more precise assessment of its validity against the article's context.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 6, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: If only the capacity of minors to conduct business is considered, and a minor is permitted to do so, their actions within that business are legally valid as they have the same capacity to act as an adult.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: Permission for a minor to conduct business by itself does not inherently make any juridical act legally valid without considering the minor's capacity or other factors.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: Grounds for revocation or limitation alone, without any context of permission or capacity, do not directly determine the legal validity of a minor's business actions.

4. (4 | N) 
Justification: The involvement of a legal representative by itself does not make a juridical act legally valid; there must be consideration of their role in granting, revoking, or limiting permissions based on specific conditions.

5. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: When both the capacity of minors and the permission for business are present, it indicates that the minor has been granted autonomy to conduct business like an adult, making their actions within that scope legally valid.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: If a minor has the capacity to act as an adult in permitted businesses but there are grounds that might make them unable to sustain it, their initial actions could still be considered legally valid until such grounds are acted upon by a legal representative.

7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The permission for business coupled with the involvement of a legal representative implies oversight and legitimate authorization, making the juridical acts under these conditions legally valid.

8. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When there are grounds for revocation or limitation and the legal representative is involved, it suggests that any actions taken by the minor could be subject to review and potential intervention, but until then, they could still be considered legally valid under the premise of permitted business.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes a minor's capacity to conduct business, permission granted for such business, and grounds that might necessitate revocation or limitation. Despite potential issues, the initial permission and capacity indicate legal validity until any intervention by a legal representative.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: With all factors present—capacity to conduct business, permission for it, grounds for potential revocation or limitation, and involvement of a legal representative—the scenario suggests a comprehensive setup where the minor's actions are initially valid but subject to oversight and potential intervention. Thus, until any such intervention, their juridical acts within the permitted businesses would be considered legally valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict on the legal validity of the minor's business actions based on Article 6.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing the Query for Factor 1
The query discusses a minor performing an act unrelated to their business without consent from their statutory agent, which may not be rescinded. This scenario involves a minor's capacity to act, but it specifically addresses actions outside the scope of the permitted business. Thus, it touches on the concept of a minor's capacity to act as an adult in certain contexts (Factor 1), but with a focus on acts beyond the business realm.

## Step 2: Assessing the Query for Factor 2
The query implies that permission was granted for the minor to carry out a business. This directly involves the factor of permission for business (Factor 2), as it mentions the minor got permission from their statutory agent for carrying out a business.

## Step 3: Assessing the Query for Factor 3
The scenario does not explicitly mention grounds that would make the minor unable to sustain the business, which is the focus of Factor 3. Instead, it discusses an act unrelated to the business, suggesting that the query does not directly entail Factor 3.

## Step 4: Assessing the Query for Factor 4
The involvement of a statutory agent (similar to a legal representative) in granting permission and potentially in the context of overseeing or rescinding acts is implied. This implies the presence of Factor 4, as it involves the role of a legal representative or statutory agent.

## Step 5: Determining Query Validity
The query suggests that an act performed by a minor without consent may not be rescinded, which can be interpreted as questioning the validity of juridical acts under certain conditions. However, it does not explicitly state that such acts are legally valid or invalid in all cases.

## Step 6: Final Assessment for Task 1
Based on the analysis:
- (Query entails 1) because it involves a minor's actions and capacity.
- (Query entails 2) since it mentions permission for business.
- (Query not entails 3) as it doesn't discuss grounds for revocation/limitation directly related to sustaining the business.
- (Query entails 4) due to the involvement of a statutory agent.

## Step 7: Final Assessment for Task 2
Given the query's focus on whether an act may not be rescinded, it implies a scenario where the juridical act could be considered valid under certain conditions (lack of consent from the statutory agent), but it does not provide a clear stance on the legal validity of all such acts. Therefore, the assessment of "(Query Valid)" or "(Query Invalid)" depends on interpreting the query's implication about legal validity.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1), (Query entails 2), (Query not entails 3), (Query entails 4), (Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding Article 9 and its legal validity concerning a specific scenario, we must first break down the article into its core components or factors. 

### Begin Factoring
1. **Juridical Act**: The article discusses juridical acts, which are actions that have legal consequences.
2. **Adult Ward**: The subject performing the juridical act is an adult ward, implying this person is under some form of guardianship or protection due to incapacity.
3. **Voidable**: The juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable, meaning it can be declared invalid if challenged.
4. **Exception for Daily Necessities**: There's an exception for acts involving the purchase of daily necessities or other day-to-day life activities, which are not voidable.
5. **Query Context**: The query needs to be evaluated against these factors to determine its legal validity.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we do not have a specific query provided to evaluate against Article 9 directly, let's consider a hypothetical scenario for demonstration purposes: "Can an adult ward's contract for buying groceries be voided?"

To determine the validity of this query:
- The act involves an **adult ward** (Factor 2), so it falls under the article's scope.
- It's about **buying groceries**, which can be considered a **daily necessity** (Factor 4).
- According to Article 9, acts involving daily necessities are not voidable (Factor 4).

Since buying groceries is a day-to-day activity and thus exempt from being voidable according to the article, the query that such a contract can be voided does not logically follow the legal context provided by Article 9. 

Therefore, for this hypothetical scenario, the response would be "N" because the act of buying groceries, being a daily necessity, is explicitly excluded from being voidable according to the article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 9, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: A juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable, and since this case involves both a juridical act (Factor 1) and an adult ward (Factor 2), the act is invalid.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Although the act is voidable (Factor 3), it involves daily necessities (Factor 4), which are exempt from being voidable according to Article 9, making the act legally valid.

3. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: A juridical act (Factor 1) that is voidable (Factor 3) would be considered invalid, as it can be declared invalid if challenged.

4. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: An adult ward (Factor 2) performing a juridical act in a query context (Factor 5) does not automatically make the act valid, and since there's no mention of daily necessities or other exemptions, the act is likely invalid.

5. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The act involves daily necessities (Factor 4), which are explicitly exempt from being voidable according to Article 9, making the act legally valid.

6. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: A juridical act (Factor 1) performed by an adult ward (Factor 2) that is voidable (Factor 3) would be considered invalid, as it can be declared invalid if challenged.

7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: An adult ward (Factor 2) performing an act involving daily necessities (Factor 4) would be exempt from being voidable according to Article 9, making the act legally valid.

8. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A juridical act (Factor 1) involving daily necessities (Factor 4) would be exempt from being voidable according to Article 9, making the act legally valid.

9. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: A voidable act (Factor 3) in a query context (Factor 5) does not provide enough information to consider it valid, and since there's no mention of daily necessities or other exemptions, the act is likely invalid.

10. (2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Although an adult ward (Factor 2) performs a voidable act (Factor 3), the act involves daily necessities (Factor 4), which are exempt from being voidable according to Article 9, making the act legally valid.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1 - Juridical Act
The query discusses the purchase of daily household items, which can be considered a juridical act as it involves a legal transaction. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2 - Adult Ward
The query mentions an adult ward performing the act, directly involving this factor. Hence, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3 - Voidable
The query implies that the act cannot be rescinded, which touches on the concept of voidability but from a perspective of legal validity rather than invalidity. This will be further analyzed in Task 2.

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4 - Exception for Daily Necessities
The purchase of daily household items falls under daily necessities, directly relating to this factor. Therefore, (Query entails 4).

## Step 5: Assessing Factor 5 - Query Context
Since the query is about determining the legal validity of an act by an adult ward concerning daily necessities, it inherently involves evaluating against the backdrop of Article 9 and its implications on such acts. Thus, (Query entails 5).

## Step 6: Task 2 - Determining Query Validity
Given that the query states the purchase of daily household items "may not be rescinded," it implies these acts are legally valid and cannot be declared void. This directly aligns with Article 9's exception for daily necessities, suggesting the query supports the legal validity of such juridical acts performed by an adult ward.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context of the provided articles, let's first factor the given legal articles into key points.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Article 13(1)** outlines specific acts for which a person under curatorship must obtain the consent of their curator, including receiving or using property producing civil fruit, borrowing money, and performing certain legal or financial transactions.
2. **Article 13(2)** allows the family court to decide that a person under curatorship needs the curator's consent for acts not listed in Article 13(1), with exceptions.
3. **Article 13(3)** states that if a curator unreasonably withholds consent, the family court can grant permission in lieu of the curator's consent.
4. **Article 13(4)** declares that acts performed without necessary consent or permission are voidable.
5. **Article 120(1)** specifies that only certain individuals (the person with qualified legal capacity, their agent, successor, or someone authorized to give consent) can rescind an act that is voidable due to limited legal capacity.
6. **Article 120(2)** states that acts voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress can be rescinded by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, their agent, or successor.
7. **Article 122** notes that a voidable act cannot be rescinded after ratification by the prescribed person.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 7>

Given these factors and without a specific query to evaluate against them, it's essential to understand how each factor contributes to the legal framework regarding curatorship, consent, voidable acts, and rescission. For any query to be considered legally valid within this context, it must align with or logically follow from one or more of these key points.

To provide a definitive answer (Y or N) regarding the validity of a query, the specific query in question would need to be analyzed against these factors to determine if it is supported by or contradicts the outlined legal principles.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors from Article 13 and related articles:

1. (1, 4 | N) 
In this scenario, a person under curatorship receives property producing civil fruit without obtaining the consent of their curator, which is a requirement under Article 13(1). Furthermore, they perform this act without necessary consent or permission, making it voidable as per Article 13(4). Therefore, the juridical act is invalid.

2. (2, 5 | Y) 
Here, the family court decides that a person under curatorship must obtain their curator's consent for an act not listed in Article 13(1), and the person with qualified legal capacity rescinds the act due to limited legal capacity as allowed by Article 120(1). Given the proper authority and procedure were followed, the act can be considered legally valid.

3. (3, 6 | Y) 
In this case, a curator unreasonably withholds consent for an act, but the family court grants permission in lieu of the curator's consent as per Article 13(3). Later, the person who made the defective manifestation of intention due to mistake, fraud, or duress rescinds the act under Article 120(2). Since both conditions were met through proper legal channels, the outcome is legally valid.

4. (1, 7 | N) 
A person under curatorship performs an act requiring consent without obtaining it and later ratifies the act. According to Article 122, a voidable act cannot be rescinded after ratification, but since the initial act was performed without necessary consent as outlined in Article 13(1), the act remains invalid.

5. (4, 6 | N) 
In this scenario, an act is performed without the curator's consent or permission, making it voidable under Article 13(4). Although the person attempts to rescind the act due to mistake, fraud, or duress as per Article 120(2), the lack of initial consent renders the act invalid.

6. (2, 3 | Y) 
The family court decides a person under curatorship needs consent for an unspecified act, and when the curator unreasonably withholds consent, the court grants permission in lieu of it. Since both Article 13(2) and Article 13(3) procedures were correctly followed, the outcome is legally valid.

7. (5, 7 | N) 
A person with qualified legal capacity rescinds an act due to limited legal capacity as per Article 120(1), but later ratifies it. Despite the initial attempt to correct the situation through proper channels, the subsequent ratification under Article 122 prevents further action, rendering the initial rescission ineffective and thus the act's validity is compromised.

8. (1, 3 | Y) 
A person under curatorship needs consent for receiving property producing civil fruit as per Article 13(1), and when the curator withholds consent unreasonably, the family court grants permission in lieu of it under Article 13(3). Since proper procedures were followed to address the issue, the act can be considered legally valid.

9. (6, 4 | N) 
An act is voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress and also performed without necessary consent or permission as per Articles 120(2) and 13(4). Given these conditions, the act's validity is compromised due to the lack of proper consent and the defective nature of the agreement.

10. (7, 2 | N) 
A voidable act is ratified, preventing further rescission under Article 122, and separately, the family court decides on the necessity for consent in an unspecified act as per Article 13(2). However, since ratification precludes any further legal action to invalidate or validate the act based on new conditions (like those introduced by Article 13(2)), and considering the scenario's context does not directly tie the ratification's impact to the court's decision on consent necessity, the overall validity in this complex scenario leans towards being invalid due to the inability to address potential issues through rescission after ratification.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

# Task 1:
Given the query: "If a person under curatorship performs, without getting the consent, an act that requires getting consent from his/her curator, the curator may ratify that act, but may not rescind that act."

We analyze this against our factored points:
- The query implies an understanding of acts requiring consent (Factor 1).
- It suggests a scenario where consent was not obtained, which aligns with the concept of voidable acts due to lack of consent (Factor 4).
- The mention of ratification by the curator relates to the principle that a voidable act cannot be rescinded after ratification (Factor 7), but specifically, it talks about who can ratify or rescind an act, which is more directly related to Factors 5 and 6.
- The specific roles of curators and their ability to consent or not are central to Article 13, particularly sections (1) and (3), indicating the relevance of Factor 1 and implicitly Factor 3.

However, the crucial aspect here is the understanding of "ratify" versus "rescind" in the context of voidable acts. Ratification makes a voidable act valid, while rescission undoes it. The query suggests that the curator can ratify (make valid) an act performed without consent but implies limitations on rescinding such acts once ratified, which is somewhat aligned with Factor 7.

Thus, the query entails:
- Factor 1: Because it discusses acts requiring consent.
- Factor 4: As it involves voidable acts due to lack of consent.
- Factor 7: Since it touches upon ratification and its implications on rescission.

Output for Task 1: (Query entails 1), (Query entails 4), (Query entails 7)

# Task 2:
To determine if the query is valid or invalid in terms of legal expression regarding juridical acts or obligations:

The query suggests that a curator can ratify an act performed by a person under curatorship without consent, which aligns with legal principles allowing for the validation of voidable acts through ratification. However, it also states that the curator "may not rescind" such an act, which seems to misinterpret the principle that after ratification, an act is no longer voidable and thus cannot be rescinded (as per Article 122).

The statement about not being able to rescind could be seen as misleading or incorrect because once an act is ratified, it's indeed validated and not subject to rescission by definition. The query seems to confuse the process of ratification and its effect on voidable acts.

Given this analysis, the query expresses a misunderstanding of how ratification impacts the ability to rescind a voidable act, leading to:

(i) receiving or using any property producing civil fruit;
(ii) borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation;
(iii) performing an act with the purpose of acquiring or losing any right regarding immovables or other significant property;
(iv) suing any procedural act;
(v) giving a gift, reaching a settlement, or entering into an arbitration agreement (meaning an arbitration agreement as provided in Article 2, paragraph (1) of the Arbitration Act (Act No. 138 of 2003));
(vi) accepting or renouncing a succession or dividing an estate;
(vii) refusing an offer of a gift, renouncing a legacy, accepting an offer of gift with burden, or accepting a legacy with burden;

(ix) granting a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602; or
(x) performing any of the acts set forth in the preceding items as a legal representative of a person with qualified legal capacity (meaning a minor, adult ward, or person under curatorship or a person under assistance who is subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1); the same applies hereinafter).
(2) At the request of a person as referred to in the main clause of Article 11
or the curator or curator's supervisor, the family court may decide that the person under curatorship must also obtain the consent of the curator before performing an act other than those set forth in each of the items of the preceding paragraph;provided, however, that this does not apply to an act provided for in the proviso to Article 9.
(3) If the curator does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent at the request of the person under curatorship.
(4) An act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.
Article 120
(1) An act that is voidable on the grounds of the qualified legal capacity to act of the person who did the act may be rescinded only by the person with qualified legal capacity (in the case of an act performed by the person as a legal representative of another person with limited capacity, including that other person with limited capacity), or an agent or successor thereof, or a person who has the authority to give consent thereto.
(2) An act that is voidable on the grounds of a mistake, fraud or duress may be rescinded only by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or an agent or successor thereof.
Article 122
A voidable act may not be rescinded after the person prescribed in Article 120
ratifies it.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given query, let's break down the provided legal articles into key factors and then evaluate the validity of the query against these factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Commencement of Guardianship**: The family court can decide to start a guardianship for someone who lacks the capacity to understand their situation due to a mental disorder.
2. **Requesters for Guardianship**: The request for guardianship can be made by the person in question, their spouse, relatives within the fourth degree of kinship, guardian of a minor, supervisor of a minor's guardian, curator, curator's supervisor, assistant, assistant's supervisor, or a public prosecutor.
3. **Commencement of Curatorship**: The family court may decide to start a curatorship for someone whose capacity to appreciate their situation is extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder.
4. **Requesters for Curatorship**: Similar to guardianship, with the addition that it does not apply if a cause for guardianship exists as per Article 7.
5. **Exclusion Criterion for Curatorship**: A curatorship cannot be commenced under Article 11 if the person is eligible for guardianship under Article 7.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

To determine the validity of a query against these articles, we would need the specific query in question. However, based on the provided information and the factoring done above, any query would be evaluated against these five key points:

- Whether it pertains to the commencement of a guardianship or curatorship.
- Who is making the request for such legal actions.
- The mental capacity criteria that differentiate between guardianship and curatorship.
- The specific relationships and roles allowed to make requests.
- The exclusion criterion that prevents overlap between guardianship and curatorship.

Without a specific query, we cannot determine its validity directly. However, the factoring provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating any query related to these articles.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, here are 10 case scenarios with their respective justifications:

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The family court can decide to commence a guardianship for someone who lacks capacity due to a mental disorder (Factor 1), and this decision can be requested by eligible individuals such as the person in question or their relatives (Factor 2). Since both conditions are met according to Article 7, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (3 | N)
Justification: The commencement of a curatorship (Factor 3) alone does not provide enough information about the mental capacity of the individual or whether the request falls under the exclusion criterion of Article 7. Without more context, such as who made the request or the specific circumstances of the mental disorder, we cannot determine validity based solely on the desire to commence a curatorship.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: This case involves the commencement of a guardianship (Factor 1) and the requesters for a curatorship (Factor 4), which includes similar parties as those for guardianship but under different circumstances. Given that the criteria for mental capacity are met for a guardianship, and assuming the request is made by an eligible party, the act would be legally valid.

4. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: When a request for guardianship or curatorship is made by eligible individuals (Factor 2) and it does not fall under the exclusion criterion of Article 7 (Factor 5), indicating that the individual's condition necessitates a specific type of legal intervention, the juridical act can be considered legally valid.

5. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: This scenario involves the commencement of a curatorship (Factor 3) and includes requesters for such (Factor 4). However, since Article 11 specifies that curatorship does not apply if a cause for guardianship exists, without knowing whether the individual's condition aligns more closely with the criteria for guardianship or curatorship, we cannot definitively say the act is valid.

6. (1, 3 | N)
Justification: The commencement of both a guardianship (Factor 1) and a curatorship (Factor 3) for the same individual suggests confusion regarding the individual's mental capacity and the appropriate legal response. Given the specific criteria for each and the exclusion provided in Article 11, without further clarification, this combination would likely be invalid due to potential overlap or misapplication of the law.

7. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: If a request is made by eligible parties (Factor 2) for the commencement of a curatorship (Factor 3), and assuming the individual's mental capacity issues align with the criteria for curatorship rather than guardianship, then the juridical act could be considered legally valid.

8. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: When the requesters for curatorship (Factor 4) are involved and the exclusion criterion of Article 7 does not apply (Factor 5), indicating that the individual's situation is indeed more aligned with the need for a curatorship, the act would be legally valid.

9. (1, 2, 3 | N)
Justification: This scenario involves the commencement of both a guardianship and a curatorship (Factors 1 and 3) with requests made by eligible parties (Factor 2). Given the specific conditions under which each can be commenced and the exclusion criterion in Article 11, attempting to apply both simultaneously would likely result in legal invalidity due to confusion over the appropriate legal intervention.

10. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: In a case where the requesters for curatorship are involved (Factor 4) but the scenario explicitly falls under the exclusion criterion of Article 7 (incorrectly stated as not applying in Factor 5), meaning the individual's condition actually warrants guardianship, the attempt to commence a curatorship would be legally invalid according to Article 11.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and their implications for the legal validity of the juridical act in question.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 1
The query discusses the commencement of guardianship and curatorship, which aligns with Factor 1. Therefore, the query entails Factor 1.

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 2
The query mentions the person in question requesting a commencement, which relates to the requesters for guardianship or curatorship as outlined in Factor 2. Hence, the query entails Factor 2.

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 3
The query talks about the commencement of curatorship, directly referencing Factor 3. Thus, the query entails Factor 3.

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 4
Similar to Factor 2, the query's mention of the person in question requesting a curatorship involves the requesters for curatorship as described in Factor 4. Consequently, the query entails Factor 4.

## Step 5: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 5
The query implies a distinction between guardianship and curatorship based on the individual's capacity, touching upon the exclusion criterion mentioned in Factor 5. Therefore, the query entails Factor 5.

## Step 6: Evaluating Query Validity
Given that Article 7 allows the person in question to request a commencement of guardianship and Article 11 similarly permits the request for a curatorship under different conditions, the query seems to misinterpret or overlook these provisions. The query suggests a distinction in the ability to request these legal actions that is not explicitly supported by the provided articles. Hence, based on the information given, the query appears to be invalid as it contradicts the explicit permissions outlined in Articles 7 and 11.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the given articles, let's first break down the provided legal text into its core components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Possession in Good Faith**: A possessor who believes they have the right to possess an item.
2. **Acquisition of Fruits**: The possessor in good faith has the right to derive benefits (fruits) from the possessed item.
3. **Defeat in Action on Title**: If a possessor in good faith loses a legal case regarding their title or right to possession, their status changes.
4. **Change in Possession Status**: Upon losing an action on title, a possessor in good faith is then considered a possessor in bad faith from the time the action was filed.
5. **Obligations of a Possessor in Bad Faith**: This includes returning fruits and reimbursing for consumed, damaged, or uncollected fruits.
6. **Possession Through Assault, Duress, or Concealment**: Individuals who obtain possession through these means are treated similarly to possessors in bad faith regarding the return and reimbursement of fruits.
7. **Reimbursement for Fruits**: The obligation to pay back for fruits that were consumed, damaged due to negligence, or not collected.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 7>

To assess the validity of a query with respect to these articles, we would need to compare its claims against these factored components. However, since no specific query is provided for evaluation, let's consider how one might approach this task:

- If a query directly aligns with one or more of these factors without contradicting them, it would likely be considered valid (Y).
- If a query contradicts any of the established factors or implies a scenario not covered by them, it would be invalid (N).

Given the requirement for an actual query to evaluate against these factors, we cannot proceed to a definitive Y or N answer. The process involves comparing each query's content against the factored components of the legal articles provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 189 and Article 190, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: A possessor in good faith has acquired fruits derived from the thing under possession, which is legally valid according to Article 189(1).

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If a possessor in good faith loses an action on title and their status changes to a possessor in bad faith, this change is legally recognized as per Article 189(2), making the juridical act valid.

3. (5 | N) 
Justification: A possessor in bad faith has obligations but without context of how they became a possessor in bad faith or any relation to fruits, it's hard to determine validity directly from Article 190(1). However, considering only this factor might not fully capture the nuances required for a valid juridical act under these specific circumstances.

4. (6 | Y) 
Justification: A person who takes possession through assault, duress, or concealment is treated similarly to a possessor in bad faith regarding fruits, which aligns with Article 190(2), making such treatment legally valid.

5. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Initially being a possessor in good faith and then facing an action on title does not inherently invalidate the initial possession or the legal process involved, thus it's considered legally valid under the context of Article 189.

6. (2, 7 | Y) 
Justification: The acquisition of fruits by a possessor in good faith and the obligation to reimburse for consumed, damaged, or uncollected fruits are both recognized aspects of possession law as outlined in Articles 189(1) and 190(1), making these actions legally valid.

7. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The change in status to a possessor in bad faith and the ensuing obligations are directly addressed by Article 189(2) and Article 190(1), respectively, thereby validating these juridical acts under the law.

8. (3, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Defeat in an action on title leading to a change in possession status, and possession through improper means being treated similarly to bad faith possession, are both scenarios that find legal basis in Articles 189(2) and 190(2), making them valid.

9. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: While being a possessor in good faith initially grants certain rights like acquiring fruits, the obligations of a possessor in bad faith do not apply until their status changes. Without such a change or context indicating bad faith actions post-status change, directly applying these obligations might not be legally valid.

10. (2, 4, 7 | Y) 
Justification: The acquisition of fruits by a possessor in good faith, the change in possession status after losing an action on title, and the obligation to reimburse for fruits are all elements that find support within Articles 189 and 190, thereby making these combined actions legally valid under the given circumstances.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Evaluate Query Against Factors
The query states that "A possessor in good faith shall acquire fruits derived from Thing in his/her possession," which directly aligns with factor 2, **Acquisition of Fruits**. It also mentions that "a person in possession Thing through duress shall be obliged to return fruits, and if the fruits have already been consumed, he/she shall be obliged to reimburse the cost of the fruits," which aligns with factors 5, **Obligations of a Possessor in Bad Faith**, and 6, **Possession Through Assault, Duress, or Concealment**.

## Step 2: Assess Query Entailment for Each Factor
- (Query entails 1) because it mentions a "possessor in good faith."
- (Query entails 2) as it talks about acquiring fruits from the thing in possession.
- (Query not entails 3) since there's no mention of an action on title being filed or lost.
- (Query not entails 4) as it doesn't explicitly discuss the change in possession status due to losing an action on title.
- (Query entails 5) because it discusses obligations related to returning and reimbursing for fruits, applicable to a possessor in bad faith.
- (Query entails 6) since it specifically mentions possession through duress.
- (Query entails 7) as reimbursement for fruits is mentioned.

## Step 3: Determine Query Validity
The query explicitly outlines scenarios that are legally valid according to the provided articles. It correctly states the rights of a possessor in good faith and the obligations of someone who possesses a thing through duress, aligning with the legal principles outlined.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we must first break down the article into its constituent factors and then analyze these factors in relation to the query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Subject Matter of Sale**: The article discusses the subject matter of a sale that has not yet been delivered.
2. **Ownership of Fruits**: It states that if the subject matter bears fruits before delivery, the fruits vest in the seller.
3. **Obligation to Pay Interest**: The buyer is obligated to pay interest on the price starting from the day of delivery.
4. **Due Date for Payment**: If a due date is provided for the payment of the price, interest does not need to be paid until that due date arrives.
5. **Delivery as a Trigger**: Delivery of the subject matter serves as a trigger for the buyer's obligation to pay interest, unless a specific due date is set.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we can analyze any query related to Article 575 to determine its legal validity within the context provided. However, since no specific query was provided for Article 575, I will demonstrate how to approach this with a hypothetical query:

Query: "Does the buyer have to pay interest on the price before the delivery of the subject matter if no due date is specified?"

Analyzing the factors:
- Factor 3 indicates that the buyer bears the obligation to pay interest starting from the day of delivery.
- There's no mention of paying interest before delivery unless a due date is provided (Factor 4), which is not applicable in this scenario.

Conclusion: Based on Factor 3, the query would be "N" because the article specifies that the buyer starts paying interest from the day of delivery, implying that interest payment does not commence before delivery. The absence of a due date (Factor 4) does not override the condition that interest payments start at delivery.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided for Article 575, here are 10 unique case scenarios, each with a justification for whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N):

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The subject matter of the sale has not been delivered, and it bears fruits. According to Factor 2, the fruits vest in the seller, which aligns with the article's stipulation. Therefore, this scenario is legally valid.

2. (3 | N)
Justification: The buyer is obligated to pay interest on the price starting from the day of delivery, but there's no mention of delivery having occurred or a due date being set. Without knowing if delivery has happened or a due date exists, we cannot conclusively determine the validity based solely on Factor 3.

3. (4 | Y)
Justification: If a due date is provided for the payment of the price, it is not necessary to pay interest until that due date arrives. This scenario directly follows the stipulation in Factor 4, making it legally valid.

4. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: The subject matter of the sale has not been delivered, and delivery serves as a trigger for the buyer's obligation to pay interest unless a specific due date is set. Since delivery is a crucial factor here, this scenario aligns with the conditions outlined in the article, making it legally valid.

5. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The subject matter bears fruits that vest in the seller, and the buyer must pay interest on the price from the day of delivery. Both conditions are met according to Factors 2 and 3, indicating this scenario is legally valid.

6. (1, 4 | N)
Justification: While a due date for payment might be set, delaying the need to pay interest until then, the mere fact that the subject matter has not been delivered does not inherently invalidate the obligation to eventually pay interest or fulfill other contractual obligations. However, without information on delivery or the fruits, this scenario's validity is questionable based solely on Factors 1 and 4.

7. (5 | Y)
Justification: Delivery serves as a trigger for the buyer's obligation to pay interest unless a specific due date is set. Since this factor directly pertains to the timing of interest payments, which is a critical aspect of the article, this scenario is considered legally valid.

8. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: The fruits vest in the seller, and if a due date is provided for payment, no interest needs to be paid until then. This combination directly follows the stipulations outlined in Factors 2 and 4, indicating legal validity.

9. (1, 3, 5 | Y)
Justification: The subject matter has not been delivered, the buyer must pay interest from the day of delivery, and delivery triggers this obligation unless a due date is set. This scenario combines key elements from Factors 1, 3, and 5, all of which are aligned with the article's conditions, making it legally valid.

10. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: The subject matter bears fruits that vest in the seller, and delivery triggers the buyer's obligation to pay interest unless a due date is specified. This scenario aligns with the conditions outlined in Factors 2 and 5, indicating legal validity based on the article's stipulations regarding ownership of fruits and the timing of interest payments.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 1
The query mentions "a seller may collect fruits until a delivery," which directly relates to the subject matter of a sale. Thus, it entails Factor 1, which discusses the "Subject Matter of Sale."

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 2
The query talks about collecting fruits, which is equivalent to saying the fruits vest in the seller until delivery. This directly aligns with Factor 2, "Ownership of Fruits," indicating that the query entails this factor as well.

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 3
There's no mention of the buyer paying interest on the price in the query, which is what Factor 3 discusses. Thus, the query does not entail Factor 3.

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 4
The query does not specify anything about a due date for payment, so it does not entail Factor 4 regarding "Due Date for Payment."

## Step 5: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 5
While the query mentions delivery, it doesn't specifically discuss the buyer's obligation to pay interest starting from the day of delivery as a trigger. However, since delivery is mentioned and it's implied that rights or obligations change at this point (the seller may collect fruits until then), one could argue it indirectly entails Factor 5, "Delivery as a Trigger."

## Step 6: Determining Query Validity
The query suggests that the seller has the right to collect fruits until delivery, which aligns with Article 575's statement that if the subject matter of a sale bears fruits before delivery, the fruits vest in the seller. Therefore, this action (or obligation) is legally valid according to the article.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1)(Query entails 2)(Query not entails 3)(Query not entails 4)(Query entails 5)(Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from Article 356 regarding the pledgee's rights to use and profit from pledged immovables, let's break down the information into its core factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Pledgee's Rights**: The article specifies that the pledgee of immovables has the right to use and profit from these immovables.
2. **Usage in Line with Relevant Immovables**: The usage and profiting must be in line with how the relevant immovables are typically used.
3. **Subject Matter of a Pledge**: The rights apply specifically to immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge.
4. **No Mention of Restrictions on Extended Parts or Appurtenances**: Unlike Article 87, there's no mention of how extended parts or appurtenances should be treated in relation to the pledged immovables.
5. **Relation to Other Legal Concepts (e.g., Extinctive Prescription)**: The article does not reference other legal concepts like extinctive prescription, which is discussed in Article 300.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 5

Given these factors and without a specific query provided for Article 356, we must consider the general context. If a query were to ask whether a pledgee can use pledged immovables as they typically would be used, the answer would logically follow from the article (Y). However, if the query introduces concepts not covered by Article 356 (like the treatment of extended parts or the effect on extinctive prescription), it might not logically follow without additional context or legal articles (N).

Since no specific query is provided for evaluation against Article 356, we must consider hypothetical scenarios based on the factors extracted. For a direct query about usage rights within typical use parameters, the answer would be affirmative (Y). For queries introducing unrelated concepts or specifics not covered by Article 356, the response could be negative (N) due to missing relevant factors or context in the article itself.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 356, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a specific combination of factors and provide a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1 | Y)
Justification: The pledgee has the right to use and profit from the immovables, as specified in factor 1. Since this is the primary condition for pledged immovables, the absence of other factors does not affect the validity.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Factors 2 and 3 are present, indicating that the usage must be in line with how the relevant immovables are typically used and that these rights apply to the subject matter of a pledge. These conditions align with Article 356's stipulations for pledged immovables.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: Although factor 4 mentions no restrictions on extended parts or appurtenances, the presence of factor 1 ensures the pledgee's rights to use and profit from the immovables are upheld. The absence of specific regulations does not invalidate the primary right.

4. (5 | N)
Justification: Factor 5 discusses relation to other legal concepts like extinctive prescription, which is not covered in Article 356. Without explicit mention or context within this article, introducing such concepts could lead to ambiguity or conflict with other laws, thus making the juridical act invalid under the scope of Article 356 alone.

5. (2 | Y)
Justification: The presence of factor 2 indicates that the usage and profiting must align with typical use parameters for the relevant immovables. Since this directly relates to how pledged immovables can be utilized, it supports the validity of the juridical act under Article 356.

6. (3, 5 | N)
Justification: While factor 3 establishes that these rights apply specifically to immovables subject to a pledge, factor 5 introduces concepts not covered by Article 356, such as extinctive prescription. The combination of these factors could lead to conflicts or ambiguities with other legal articles, making the act invalid.

7. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Factors 1 and 2 being present means the pledgee has the right to use and profit from the immovables in a manner consistent with their typical use. This directly aligns with Article 356's provisions for pledged immovables.

8. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: The absence of restrictions on extended parts or appurtenances (factor 4) combined with the introduction of unrelated legal concepts (factor 5) creates ambiguity and potential conflict with other laws not addressed in Article 356. This makes it difficult to validate the juridical act solely based on this article.

9. (3 | Y)
Justification: Factor 3 specifies that these rights apply to immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge, directly supporting the validity of pledged immovables under Article 356's conditions.

10. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The presence of factors 1, 2, and 3 comprehensively covers the pledgee's rights to use and profit from the immovables in line with their typical use and as part of a pledge agreement. This combination fully aligns with Article 356's stipulations for pledged immovables.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and provides a clear justification based on the presence or absence of these factors in relation to Article 356's provisions.

 To evaluate the query against Article 89, let's first break down the article into its key components or factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Ownership Acquisition**: The method through which ownership of natural fruits is acquired.
2. **Separation Criterion**: Natural fruits are acquired when they are separated from the original thing.
3. **Civil Fruits Acquisition**: Civil fruits are acquired in proportion to the duration of the right to obtain them.
4. **Prorated Calculation Basis**: The calculation for acquiring civil fruits is on a prorated, daily basis.
5. **Entitlement**: The person entitled to obtain natural or civil fruits has a right to their acquisition.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given the query isn't explicitly stated in your prompt, I'll create a hypothetical query for illustration purposes: "A person acquires full ownership of natural fruits immediately upon separation, regardless of previous entitlements." 

To determine if this query is legally valid within the context of Article 89:

- **Ownership Acquisition (Factor 1)** and **Entitlement (Factor 5)** suggest that acquisition is based on entitlement, not immediate full ownership.
- **Separation Criterion (Factor 2)** indicates a specific condition (separation) for acquiring natural fruits, which aligns with the query but doesn't address the proportion or timing of civil fruits acquisition directly.
- **Civil Fruits Acquisition (Factor 3)** and **Prorated Calculation Basis (Factor 4)** introduce a concept (proportionate acquisition based on duration of right) that contradicts the immediate full ownership implied by the query.

Given these factors, the hypothetical query does not logically follow the legal context provided by Article 89 because it overlooks the proportional and prorated nature of acquiring civil fruits and potentially misinterprets the immediacy and conditions of natural fruits acquisition. Therefore, the answer would be "N".
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 89, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each considering a different subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The acquisition of natural fruits is based on separation from the original thing, and ownership is acquired upon this separation. Since both factors related to the acquisition of natural fruits are present, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Civil fruits are acquired in proportion to the duration of the right, calculated on a prorated daily basis. Without considering entitlement or the separation criterion for natural fruits, the calculation alone does not guarantee legal validity, especially if it disregards existing rights or Separation Criterion.

3. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The person entitled to obtain natural fruits acquires ownership upon their separation from the original thing. This scenario upholds the principle of entitlement and acquisition through separation, making the juridical act legally valid.

4. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: While the separation criterion is crucial for acquiring natural fruits, and civil fruits are calculated on a prorated basis, this combination lacks consideration of entitlement and the method of acquiring civil fruits in proportion to the right's duration, potentially leading to disputes over rightful ownership.

5. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Civil fruits are acquired in proportion to the duration of the right to obtain them, and the person entitled has a legitimate claim. This scenario respects both the proportional acquisition of civil fruits and the principle of entitlement, making it legally valid.

6. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although natural fruits are acquired upon separation, and civil fruits in proportion to the duration of the right, this combination ignores the prorated calculation basis for civil fruits and the separation criterion's direct relevance to natural fruits alone, potentially leading to inconsistencies in application.

7. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The separation criterion is clear for natural fruits, and the person entitled has a right to their acquisition. This straightforward scenario respects both the condition for acquiring natural fruits and the principle of entitlement, making it legally valid.

8. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: While the calculation basis for civil fruits is prorated daily, and there's an entitlement to obtain fruits, this combination lacks clarity on how natural fruits are acquired (separation criterion) and how civil fruits are acquired in proportion to the right's duration, leading to potential legal ambiguities.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario covers the acquisition of both natural and civil fruits comprehensively, including the separation criterion for natural fruits, the method of acquiring ownership, and the proportional acquisition of civil fruits based on the right's duration, making it legally valid.

10. (2, 3, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive scenario considers all aspects: the separation criterion for natural fruits, the proportional and prorated calculation for civil fruits, and the entitlement principle. It respects all conditions and principles outlined in Article 89, making the juridical act legally valid.

Each case provides a clear verdict based on the factors of Article 89 considered.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factors
To assess whether the query entails each factor, we must analyze the query in relation to each factor listed.

- **Ownership Acquisition (Factor 1)**: The query discusses the distribution of rent between person A and person B based on a special agreement, which does not directly address how ownership of natural fruits is acquired. However, it implies an arrangement for benefits (rent) to be shared, suggesting some form of acquisition or entitlement to these benefits.
- **Separation Criterion (Factor 2)**: The query involves the donation of a house and an agreement about rent distribution but does not explicitly mention the separation of natural fruits from an original thing. Thus, it doesn't directly entail this factor.
- **Civil Fruits Acquisition (Factor 3)**: The query mentions distributing rent in proportion to the number of days, which aligns with acquiring civil fruits in proportion to the duration of the right to obtain them.
- **Prorated Calculation Basis (Factor 4)**: The distribution of rent on a daily prorated basis directly entails this factor.
- **Entitlement (Factor 5)**: The special agreement for rent distribution implies that person A and person B have entitlements to the rent, which suggests an aspect of entitlement.

## Step 2: Evaluating Query Validity
To determine if the query is valid or invalid according to Article 89, we need to see if it aligns with or contradicts the principles outlined in the article. The query discusses a specific scenario involving the distribution of rent based on days, which seems to follow a prorated and proportional logic similar to what Article 89 describes for civil fruits.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 3)(Query entails 4)(Query entails 5)(Query Valid)}$

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement with respect to Article 707, let's first factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Performance by Mistake**: The article discusses a scenario where a person who is not an obligor performs an obligation mistakenly.
2. **Good Faith Action by Obligee**: The obligee acts in good faith, which leads to the instrument being lost, damaged, security being waived, or the claim being lost by prescription.
3. **Consequence of Performance by Mistake**: The person who performed the obligation cannot demand the return of what they performed.
4. **Right to Reimbursement**: Despite the above, the performer has a right to reimbursement against the actual obligor.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Now, analyzing the query: "If a person mistakenly performs an obligation and the obligee in good faith loses the claim, can the person demand reimbursement from the obligor?"

Based on the factored components:
- The article specifically states that the person performing the obligation by mistake cannot demand the return of what they performed if the conditions (like good faith action by the obligee leading to loss of instrument or claim) are met.
- However, it also explicitly mentions that this does not preclude the right to reimbursement against the actual obligor.

Therefore, given these factors and their implications:
- The query about demanding reimbursement from the obligor directly aligns with factor 4 (Right to Reimbursement), which indicates such a demand is legally valid according to Article 707.
- Thus, despite the initial inability to recover what was performed due to the conditions outlined, there's a clear provision for seeking reimbursement from the obligor.

Given this analysis, the query logically follows the legal context provided by Article 707. 

The answer is: Y
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 707, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: A person performs an obligation by mistake. According to factor 4 (Right to Reimbursement), the person has a right to reimbursement against the actual obligor, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: The obligee acts in good faith but does not lead to any loss of instrument or claim. Since factor 2 alone does not provide grounds for invalidity without the consequence outlined in factor 3, we consider other factors for a complete assessment. However, given only this factor is considered, it suggests an action that doesn't inherently invalidate the obligation.

3. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: A person performs an obligation by mistake, and the obligee acts in good faith, leading to no specific consequences as outlined. The right to reimbursement (factor 4) remains unaffected for the performer against the obligor, thus making it legally valid.

4. (3 | N) 
Justification: The person who performed the obligation cannot demand the return of what they performed due to the conditions met (e.g., good faith action by the obligee). This factor directly addresses the inability to recover what was performed under certain conditions, suggesting invalidity in demanding return but not necessarily in seeking reimbursement.

5. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The person performing the obligation has a right to reimbursement against the actual obligor. This is explicitly stated and stands alone as a basis for legal validity regarding reimbursement.

6. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: A person performs an obligation by mistake, and they cannot demand the return of what they performed due to the conditions outlined. While there's a provision for reimbursement against the obligor (factor 4), this specific scenario focuses on the inability to recover what was performed, suggesting invalidity in that context.

7. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: The obligee acts in good faith, leading to the instrument being lost or another condition met, and as a result, the person who performed the obligation cannot demand its return. This combination emphasizes the consequence of the good faith action on the ability to recover what was performed, indicating invalidity in demanding return.

8. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A person performs an obligation by mistake but has a right to reimbursement against the actual obligor. The performance by mistake does not negate the right to seek reimbursement, making this scenario legally valid concerning seeking compensation from the obligor.

9. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee acts in good faith, and despite any consequences (like loss of instrument), the person performing the obligation has a right to reimbursement against the actual obligor. This indicates that the good faith action and its consequences do not affect the validity of seeking reimbursement.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: All factors are present - performance by mistake, good faith action by the obligee leading to loss or another condition, inability to demand return, but with a right to reimbursement against the obligor. Despite the complexities and conditions that lead to an inability to recover what was performed directly, the explicit provision for reimbursement (factor 4) ensures legal validity in seeking compensation from the actual obligor.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To evaluate the validity of a query based on Article 119, let's first break down the article into its key components or factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Definition of a Void Act**: An act that is void does not have legal effect.
2. **Effect of Ratification on a Void Act**: Generally, ratification cannot make a void act effective.
3. **Exception to Ratification Effectiveness**: If a party ratifies an act knowing it is void, this ratification is considered a new act.
4. **Implication of Knowing Ratification**: The act of ratifying a known void act implies intent and awareness of the act's original invalidity.
5. **Legal Outcome of New Act**: A new act, as deemed by ratification of a void act with full knowledge, has legal consequences separate from the original void act.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we can analyze queries to determine if they logically follow from Article 119. For instance, a query like "Ratifying a void contract makes it legally binding" would be invalid (N) because it contradicts factor 2, which states that ratification generally cannot make a void act effective. However, a nuanced understanding based on factor 3 might suggest that if the ratification is done with full knowledge of the act's voidness, it could lead to a new legal arrangement, thus potentially validating certain queries under specific conditions outlined in the article.

Without a specific query provided for Article 119, we must consider hypothetical scenarios:
- A query stating "A void contract becomes legally effective through ratification" would be "N" because it directly contradicts factor 2.
- A query stating "Ratifying a known void act can lead to legal consequences as if it were a new act" would be "Y" because it aligns with factors 3 and 5, indicating an understanding of the exception and its implications.

Thus, the validity of a query depends on its alignment with these factors, particularly how it addresses the nuances of ratification's effect on void acts and the implications of knowing ratification.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 119 and its factors, I will generate 10 case scenarios as instructed:


1. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: A void act (factor 1) that is ratified without knowledge of its voidness (factor 2) does not become legally effective because ratification generally cannot make a void act effective.


2. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If a party ratifies an act knowing it is void (factor 3), this ratification is considered a new act (factor 5), which can lead to legal consequences separate from the original void act, making the juridical act legally valid.


3. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Knowing that an act is void (factor 4) does not automatically make it legally effective if it is indeed a void act (factor 1), as knowledge of voidness alone does not validate an otherwise invalid act.


4. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: Generally, ratification cannot make a void act effective (factor 2), and even if this leads to legal consequences as if it were a new act (factor 5), the initial act's voidness is not directly overcome by these consequences without explicit knowledge and intent.


5. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: If a party ratifies a void act (factor 1) knowing it is void (factor 3), this act of ratification is deemed a new act, potentially leading to legal validity based on the intention and awareness behind the ratification.


6. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The general rule that ratification cannot make a void act effective (factor 2) combined with the implication of knowing ratification (factor 4) does not automatically validate an otherwise void act without considering it as a new act.


7. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Ratifying an act knowing it is void (factor 3) implies intent and awareness of the act's original invalidity (factor 4), which can lead to legal consequences as if the ratification were a new act, potentially validating the juridical act.


8. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: A void act (factor 1) does not become legally effective simply because it could lead to legal consequences as if it were a new act (factor 5) without the element of knowing ratification.


9. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Although generally, ratification cannot make a void act effective (factor 2), if a party ratifies an act knowing it is void (factor 3), this exception allows for the ratification to be considered a new act, potentially leading to legal validity.


10. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The implication of knowing ratification (factor 4) combined with the understanding that such ratification can lead to legal consequences as if it were a new act (factor 5) supports the legality of the juridical act, as it implies intention and awareness leading to a potentially valid new arrangement.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Task 1 - Assessing Query Factors
To determine if the query entails each factor, let's analyze it step by step:
- The query mentions a contract being void due to a mistake and then being ratified by the person who made the manifestation, knowing it was void. This implies an understanding of what a void act is (Factor 1) and the effect of ratification on such acts (Factor 2).
- It specifically addresses the scenario where ratification occurs with knowledge of the act's voidness, which aligns with Factor 3.
- The query suggests that after ratification with full knowledge, the contract becomes effective retroactively. This touches upon the implications of knowing ratification (Factor 4) and the legal outcome of such a new act (Factor 5).

## Step 2: Task 1 - Output for Each Factor
Based on the analysis:
- (Query entails 1) because it involves a void contract.
- (Query entails 2) since it discusses the ratification of a void act, implying an understanding that generally, ratification does not make a void act effective.
- (Query entails 3) as it specifies ratification with knowledge of the voidness.
- (Query entails 4) because it implies intent and awareness of the original invalidity by mentioning ratification "knowing that such act is void."
- (Query entails 5) since it talks about the legal consequence (the contract becoming effective retroactively) of what is deemed a new act.

## Step 3: Task 2 - Validity Assessment
The query suggests that after ratification with full knowledge, the contract becomes effective retroactively. This implies that despite initially being void, the juridical act (or obligation) becomes legally valid under certain conditions. Thus, the query explicitly determines that the juridical acts (or obligations) are legally valid after the specified condition is met.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

 To address the given problem, we first need to factor the provided article into its key components to understand its legal context and implications.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Ownership Rights**: The article states that an owner has rights to use, profit from, and dispose of a thing owned.
2. **Limitations by Law**: These ownership rights are subject to the limits of laws and regulations.
3. **Freedom of Use**: Owners have the freedom to use their property as they see fit within legal boundaries.
4. **Profitability**: Owners can profit from their possessions.
5. **Disposal Rights**: Owners have the right to dispose of their property, again within legal limits.
6. **Regulatory Compliance**: All actions regarding the owned thing must comply with existing laws and regulations.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 6>

Given the query is not directly provided in your request, I'll demonstrate how to apply this factoring to a hypothetical query related to Article 206:

Query: "Can an owner sell their property without any restrictions?"

To determine if this query is legally valid within the context of Article 206:
- The article explicitly states that an owner has the right to dispose of (which includes selling) their property.
- However, it also mentions that these rights are "within the limits of laws and regulations," implying there could be restrictions.

Given this analysis, the answer would depend on whether the sale complies with all relevant laws and regulations. Since the article does imply a right to dispose of property (factor 5) but also emphasizes the importance of regulatory compliance (factor 6), without specific details on the nature of the sale or the applicable laws, we can infer that the query generally aligns with the principles outlined in Article 206 but might not capture all nuances.

Therefore, based on the factors present and considering the need for legal compliance:
- The query touches on **Disposal Rights** (factor 5) and implies an understanding of **Regulatory Compliance** (factor 6), suggesting a level of validity.
- However, without specifying that the sale must be within legal limits, it slightly misses the full context provided by the article.

If we were to answer based strictly on whether the query logically follows from the article's context, considering the emphasis on both disposal rights and regulatory compliance:
The best answer is Y.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 206, I'll generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The owner has ownership rights and is subject to limitations by law, which means their actions are guided by both their rights and legal boundaries, making their juridical act valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The freedom of use combined with disposal rights allows an owner to use their property as they see fit and then dispose of it, aligning with the principles of Article 206, thus valid.

3. (4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Profiting from a possession while ensuring regulatory compliance means the owner is exercising their right to profitability in a legally sound manner, making the act valid.

4. (1, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Ownership rights that include freedom of use and the ability to profit imply a broad range of legitimate actions an owner can take with their property, thus valid.

5. (2, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Being subject to limitations by law and ensuring regulatory compliance are fundamental to making any juridical act related to ownership valid, as it ensures legality.

6. (1, 4, 5 | N) 
Justification: While owning something grants the right to profit from it and dispose of it, without considering the limits of laws and regulations or freedom of use, certain actions might not be legally compliant, potentially making the act invalid without further context on compliance.

7. (3, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Freedom of use coupled with regulatory compliance ensures that an owner's use of their property is both unrestricted in a general sense and legally sound, thus valid.

8. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Being subject to limitations by law and the ability to profit do not automatically validate an action without considering disposal rights or freedom of use, potentially making certain acts invalid if they don't fully comply with all aspects of ownership rights.

9. (1, 5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Ownership rights that include the right to dispose of property and are exercised within regulatory compliance boundaries are clearly valid under Article 206.

10. (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes all aspects of ownership rights and regulatory considerations, ensuring that any juridical act based on these factors would be thoroughly compliant with Article 206, thus valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and a clear determination of validity based on the principles outlined in Article 206.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks based on the provided information:

### Task 1:
Assessing whether the query entails each of the factors listed from Article 206:

1. **Ownership Rights**: The query discusses person A's ability to demand removal of disturbance based on ownership, so (Query entails 1).
2. **Limitations by Law**: The query implies limitations by stating conditions under which person A can demand action, suggesting compliance with legal principles, so (Query entails 2).
3. **Freedom of Use**: The query does not directly discuss the freedom to use but focuses on disturbance and remedy, so (Query not entails 3).
4. **Profitability**: There's no mention of profiting from the thing owned in the query, so (Query not entails 4).
5. **Disposal Rights**: The query doesn't address disposal rights directly; it talks about disturbance and legal recourse, so (Query not entails 5).
6. **Regulatory Compliance**: The query implies regulatory compliance by suggesting that person A's actions are contingent on certain conditions being met (e.g., serious and considerable irreparable damage), so (Query entails 6).

### Task 2:
Determining the validity of the query based on its alignment with legal principles:

Given that the query outlines a specific scenario under which person A can demand the removal or discontinuance of disturbance from person B, and it implies conditions and limitations that must be met for such an action to be taken (e.g., incurring serious and considerable irreparable damage), the query seems to express a conditional validity based on legal principles. However, without explicitly stating that these actions are legally valid under all circumstances described by Article 206, but instead providing conditions under which they can occur, it leans towards describing a scenario where certain juridical acts could be considered valid if those conditions are met.

Therefore, since the query provides specific conditions for when person A's demands can be made (implying a form of legal validity within those conditions), the answer to Task 2 is: (Query Valid)

 To address the query regarding Article 181 and its relation to the given sentence, let's break down the information provided into key factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Possessory Rights**: The article mentions that possessory rights can be acquired.
2. **Acquisition Through Agent**: It specifies that these rights can be acquired through an agent.
3. **No Specification on Type of Acquisition**: There is no detail on what types of acquisitions are possible (e.g., purchase, gift, etc.).
4. **Implication of Agency in Law**: The involvement of an agent implies a legal representation or action on behalf of another party.
5. **General Principle of Acquiring Rights**: Typically, acquiring rights involves some form of transaction or agreement.

Given the sentence "Possessory rights may be acquired through an agent," and comparing it with the factors derived from Article 181:

- The article directly states that possessory rights can indeed be acquired through an agent.
- There's no contradictory information provided in the query that would invalidate this statement based on the given legal context.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given the analysis, since the query aligns with what Article 181 states about acquiring possessory rights through an agent without introducing any contradictory or unsupported claims within the provided context, the response to whether the query is legally valid with the context of the article is: Y. 

This conclusion is reached because all necessary factors to support the statement are present and aligned with the information given in Article 181.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors derived from Article 181, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Possessory rights can be acquired through an agent as stated directly by the article.

2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Without specification on the type of acquisition and only implying agency in law, it's unclear if all types of acquisitions are valid, thus making the juridical act invalid due to lack of specificity.

3. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The general principle of acquiring rights typically involves a transaction or agreement, which aligns with the concept of possessory rights being acquired.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Acquiring rights through an agent is a form of representation that can involve various transactions or agreements, making it legally valid.

5. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: While possessory rights can be acquired, the lack of detail on what types of acquisitions are possible introduces uncertainty, rendering the act invalid.

6. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The implication of agency in law combined with the general principle of acquiring rights supports the legal validity of such actions.

7. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Despite possessory rights being acquirable through an agent, the absence of specifics on the type of acquisition complicates the legality, making it invalid due to ambiguity.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Acquiring possessory rights through an agent is explicitly allowed, and the involvement of an agent in legal representation supports its validity.

9. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The lack of specification on types of acquisitions combined with general principles of acquiring rights does not provide enough clarity to deem the act legally valid.

10. (1, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: With possessory rights being acquirable, and considering both the implication of agency in law and the general principle of acquiring rights, the act is supported as legally valid.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors to determine the legal validity of the juridical act based on Article 181.

 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the factors and the query "An agent may even acquire a possessory right, but since the effect of possession by the agent belongs to the principle, the agent him/herself may not acquire an individual possessory right for the thing possessed.":

1. **Possessory Rights**: The query mentions that an agent may acquire a possessory right, which aligns with this factor.
   - (Query entails 1)

2. **Acquisition Through Agent**: The query directly states that an agent may acquire a possessory right, fulfilling this condition.
   - (Query entails 2)

3. **No Specification on Type of Acquisition**: The query does not specify the type of acquisition (e.g., purchase, gift), which is in line with this factor.
   - (Query entails 3)

4. **Implication of Agency in Law**: The query implies agency by mentioning that the effect of possession belongs to the principle, indicating legal representation.
   - (Query entails 4)

5. **General Principle of Acquiring Rights**: The query touches on acquiring rights through an agent, which is a form of transaction or agreement.
   - (Query entails 5)


### Task 2:
The query discusses the nuances of an agent acquiring possessory rights but notes that the effect belongs to the principle, suggesting limitations rather than outright invalidation. However, it does imply certain conditions under which juridical acts might not be fully valid for the agent themselves (e.g., acquiring an individual possessory right). The query does not explicitly state that the juridical acts are invalid but rather provides a condition or limitation.

Given this analysis:
- (Query Valid) 

This conclusion is based on the understanding that while there are conditions and limitations discussed, the query does not outright declare the acts as legally invalid. Instead, it clarifies the legal implications of an agent's actions in acquiring possessory rights.

 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the article provided, let's first factor the given legal article into its key components.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Timeframe for Filing Action for Maintenance of Possession**: An action must be filed during obstruction or within one year after it stops.
2. **Exception for Damaged Possessed Things Due to Construction**: If the thing has been damaged due to construction, and either one year has passed since construction started or the construction is completed, no action can be filed.
3. **Action for Preservation of Possession**: This can be filed as long as there's a danger of obstruction.
4. **Application of Exception to Preservation Actions**: The exception regarding construction damage also applies to preservation actions if the thing is likely to be damaged by construction work.
5. **Timeframe for Action for Recovery of Possession**: Such an action must be filed within one year from the time of forcible dispossession.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we can now evaluate queries against the legal context provided to determine their validity. However, since no specific query is provided for evaluation against Article 201, I will demonstrate how to apply this factoring to a hypothetical query:

- **Hypothetical Query**: Can an action for maintenance of possession be filed two years after the obstruction has stopped if there was no construction involved?

**Evaluation**: 
- This query involves factors 1 (Timeframe for Filing Action for Maintenance of Possession) and potentially factor 2, but since there's no mention of construction or damage due to it, factor 2 is not directly relevant.
- According to factor 1, an action must be filed within one year after the obstruction stops. Therefore, filing two years after the obstruction has stopped would not be valid according to the provided legal context.

**Response**: N

This response is based on the fact that the query does not align with the timeframe specified in the article for filing an action for maintenance of possession.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 201, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: An action for maintenance of possession is filed within one year after the obstruction stops, which aligns with the timeframe specified in factor 1.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: The possessed thing has been damaged due to construction work, and one year has passed since the construction started. According to factor 2, no action can be filed in this scenario.

3. (3 | Y) 
Justification: An action for preservation of possession is filed when there's a danger of obstruction, which is allowed as long as the danger exists according to factor 3.

4. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: An action for maintenance of possession is filed during the obstruction, and there's also a danger of future obstruction, allowing for both maintenance and preservation actions to be considered valid under factors 1 and 3.

5. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The possessed thing is likely to be damaged by construction work, and the construction has been completed. Even if considering preservation, the exception applies due to the likelihood of damage from construction, making the action invalid according to factors 2 and 4.

6. (5 | Y) 
Justification: An action for recovery of possession is filed within one year from the time of forcible dispossession, which is within the allowed timeframe specified in factor 5.

7. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: An action for maintenance of possession is filed within one year after the obstruction stops, and it also involves a scenario where the possessor was previously forcibly dispossessed but is now filing within the correct timeframe for both maintenance and recovery actions, as per factors 1 and 5.

8. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: An action for preservation of possession is filed because there's a danger of obstruction, and although the possessed thing might be damaged due to construction work, the action can still be filed as long as the construction hasn't been completed or one year hasn't passed since it started, according to factors 3 and 4.

9. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: The possessed thing has been damaged due to construction, and either one year has passed since the construction started or it's been completed. Additionally, there was a forcible dispossession more than a year ago. Given these conditions, no action for recovery of possession can be filed within the specified timeframe, and the damage due to construction further invalidates any potential action under factors 2 and 5.

10. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: An action for maintenance of possession is considered during an obstruction, but the possessed thing has also been damaged due to construction work, and one year has passed since the construction started. Despite the ongoing obstruction, the exception regarding damage from construction applies, making the action invalid according to factors 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the output is: (Query entails 5)

# Task 2:
The query statement aligns with the legal provision outlined in Article 201, specifically section (3), which dictates that an action for recovery of possession must be filed within one year from the time when a possessor was forcibly dispossessed.

 To evaluate the query's validity based on Article 184, let's break down the article into its key components or factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Possession through an Agent**: The initial possession of a thing is done through an agent.
2. **Principal's Order**: The principal orders the agent to possess the thing on behalf of a third party.
3. **Third Party Consent**: The third party must consent to this arrangement.
4. **Acquisition of Possessory Rights**: As a result, the third party acquires possessory rights over the thing.

Given query is: "If a principal orders an agent to possess something on behalf of a third party without the third party's knowledge, does the third party acquire possessory rights?"


### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 4

To assess whether the query logically follows from Article 184, we examine each factor in relation to the query:

1. **Possession through an Agent** - This is present in the query.
2. **Principal's Order** - Also present; the principal orders the agent.
3. **Third Party Consent** - Missing; the query specifies "without the third party's knowledge," implying lack of consent.
4. **Acquisition of Possessory Rights** - The outcome in question.

The critical factor missing from the query is the **Third Party Consent**, which Article 184 explicitly states as a requirement for the third party to acquire possessory rights. Without this consent, the conditions outlined in Article 184 are not fully met.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the factors identified, the response to whether the query logically follows from the legal context of Article 184 is: **N**

This conclusion is drawn because the absence of third-party consent directly contravenes one of the explicit conditions (factor 3) laid out in Article 184 for the acquisition of possessory rights by the third party.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 184, I will generate 10 case scenarios with different combinations of factors. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: The principal orders the agent to possess the thing on behalf of a third party, but without the third party's consent or knowledge, and without the initial possession through an agent being directly relevant to the outcome. Thus, the lack of third-party consent makes the juridical act invalid.

2. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: The thing is possessed through an agent and the third party consents, but there's no order from the principal to possess it on behalf of the third party. This missing element renders the act invalid as it doesn't meet all conditions outlined in Article 184.

3. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The principal orders the agent, and the outcome is that the third party acquires possessory rights, but there's no indication that the thing was initially possessed through an agent or that the third party consented to this arrangement. Without all required elements, the act cannot be considered valid.

4. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: All necessary factors are present - possession through an agent, the principal's order, and the third party's consent. This meets all conditions of Article 184 for the third party to acquire possessory rights, making the act legally valid.

5. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: The third party consents and acquires possessory rights, but there's no indication that the thing was possessed through an agent initially or that the principal ordered the agent to do so on behalf of the third party. Without these elements, the conditions for validity under Article 184 are not fully met.

6. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: The initial possession is through an agent, and the outcome is the acquisition of possessory rights by the third party, but there's no principal's order or third-party consent mentioned. This lack of critical factors makes the act invalid according to Article 184.

7. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: The principal orders the agent, and the third party consents, but there's no mention of the initial possession being through an agent. Without this factor, the scenario does not fully align with the requirements outlined in Article 184 for acquiring possessory rights.

8. (1 | N) 
Justification: The thing is possessed through an agent, but none of the other conditions (principal's order, third-party consent, or acquisition of possessory rights) are met. Thus, it does not fulfill the criteria set forth by Article 184 for validity.

9. (2 | N) 
Justification: The principal orders the agent to possess the thing on behalf of a third party, but without initial possession through an agent, third-party consent, or the acquisition of possessory rights being directly relevant. This scenario lacks too many key factors to be considered valid under Article 184.

10. (4 | N) 
Justification: The outcome is that the third party acquires possessory rights, but none of the preceding conditions (possession through an agent, principal's order, or third-party consent) are mentioned. Without these foundational elements, the act cannot be deemed valid according to Article 184.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 184 and provides a clear verdict based on whether all necessary conditions for validity are met.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1 - Possession through an Agent
The query states that person A orders person B to possess the moveable on behalf of person C, indicating that possession is indeed through an agent. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2 - Principal's Order
Person A, the principal, gives an order to person B, the agent, to possess the moveable on behalf of person C. This shows the presence of the principal's order. Hence, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3 - Third Party Consent
The query mentions that person C consented to the arrangement, fulfilling the condition of third-party consent. Thus, (Query entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4 - Acquisition of Possessory Rights
The query concludes with person C acquiring the possessory right for the moveable, directly addressing the outcome of the process described in Article 184. Therefore, (Query entails 4).

## Step 5: Evaluating Query Validity
Given that all factors required by Article 184 are present and correctly applied in the query, leading to the conclusion that person C acquires possessory rights, we can determine the validity of the query based on these conditions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 To determine whether a given query is legally valid within the context of the provided article, we first need to factor the article into its key components or factors. This process involves identifying and isolating the crucial elements that define the legal principle or rule outlined in the article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Transfer of Possessory Rights**: The article discusses how possessory rights can be transferred.
2. **Delivery of the Thing Possessed**: It mentions that the transfer is typically effected by delivering the thing possessed.
3. **Manifestation of Intention**: An exception allows for transfer through the parties' manifestations of intention alone if certain conditions are met (e.g., the transferee or their agent already holds the thing).
4. **Condition for Manifestation of Intention**: The condition for this exception is that the transferee or their agent must be actually holding the thing under possession.
5. **Legal Effectiveness of Transfer Methods**: Both delivery and manifestation of intention are recognized as legally effective methods for transferring possessory rights, depending on the circumstances.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 5

Given this factoring, we can now assess queries against these factors to determine their legal validity within the context provided. However, since a specific query is not provided in your request, I will demonstrate how to apply this factoring process with a hypothetical query:

- **Hypothetical Query**: Can possessory rights be transferred if the transferee has never physically held the item but both parties agree on the transfer?

To assess the validity of this query:
- It involves the **transfer of possessory rights** (Factor 1).
- It does not explicitly mention **delivery of the thing possessed** (Factor 2), suggesting an inquiry into alternative methods.
- The query implies a scenario where the transfer might occur through **manifestation of intention** (Factor 3), but it lacks detail on whether the transferee or their agent is actually holding the thing, which is a crucial **condition for manifestation of intention** (Factor 4).

Given this analysis, without explicit mention that the transferee or their agent is holding the thing and thus not fully aligning with Factor 4, the query might seem to stretch the conditions under which possessory rights can be transferred solely by manifestation of intention. However, since both delivery and manifestation of intention are recognized methods of transfer (Factor 5), depending on how one interprets "both parties agree on the transfer," it could potentially align with the legal principles outlined, especially if this agreement is considered a form of manifestation of intention that meets the article's conditions.

Therefore, without a specific query to evaluate directly against these factors and considering the hypothetical example provided for demonstration purposes, the assessment would lean towards a cautious "Y" if the query closely aligns with the factors, particularly emphasizing an agreed-upon transfer where physical possession is not explicitly required or is implied to be part of the process. However, this response requires direct application to a specific query for a definitive answer.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 182, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The transfer of possessory rights is effected by the delivery of the thing possessed, which aligns with Factor 1 and Factor 2. Since both conditions for a valid transfer are met, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The parties' manifestations of intention alone can effect the transfer of possessory rights under certain conditions (Factor 3), and both delivery and manifestation of intention are recognized as legally effective methods for transferring possessory rights (Factor 5). Given that the scenario involves a clear intention to transfer, it is legally valid.

3. (1 | N) 
Justification: While Factor 1 discusses the transfer of possessory rights, on its own, it does not provide enough information to determine the validity of the transfer without knowing how the transfer was effected (delivery or manifestation of intention). However, since no method of transfer is specified, we cannot assume validity solely based on the intent to transfer.

4. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The delivery of the thing possessed (Factor 2) is a direct method for transferring possessory rights. Even though Factor 4 (condition for manifestation of intention) is mentioned, the presence of Factor 2 ensures that the transfer method is clear and legally effective.

5. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The parties' manifestations of intention alone can effect the transfer (Factor 3), and if the transferee or their agent is actually holding the thing under possession (Factor 4), this meets the condition for such a transfer to be valid. Thus, the juridical act is legally valid.

6. (5 | Y) 
Justification: Recognizing both delivery and manifestation of intention as legally effective methods for transferring possessory rights (Factor 5) provides a broad basis for determining legal validity. Since this factor encompasses the legally recognized methods of transfer without specifying which must be used, any transfer that aligns with either method would be considered valid.

7. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: While Factor 1 discusses the transfer of possessory rights and Factor 3 mentions the manifestation of intention as a method for transfer, simply having an intention to transfer without either delivering the thing possessed or ensuring the transferee is already in possession does not meet the specific conditions outlined for a valid transfer through manifestation of intention.

8. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The delivery of the thing possessed (Factor 2) directly effects the transfer of possessory rights, and Factor 5 confirms that delivery is one of the legally recognized methods for such transfers. Therefore, this scenario clearly outlines a legally valid transfer method.

9. (4 | N) 
Justification: Factor 4 discusses a condition for the manifestation of intention to be effective (the transferee or their agent holding the thing), but on its own, it does not provide enough information about how the transfer was actually effected. Without knowing if the transfer occurred through delivery or manifestation of intention, and merely having a condition without the action, we cannot determine legal validity.

10. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: While Factor 1 is about the transfer of possessory rights and Factor 4 provides a condition for one type of transfer, simply knowing that there's an intent to transfer and a condition for manifestation of intention does not confirm that either delivery or manifestation of intention actually occurred. Without clear evidence of how the transfer was effected, we cannot assume legal validity.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 182, allowing for a determinate verdict on the legal validity of the juridical act based on the presence and interaction of these factors.

 To address the given query, let's first factor the provided articles into key points to understand their context and implications.


### Begin Factoring
1. Possessory rights can be acquired through an agent (Article 181).
2. A bailee is not allowed to use the bailed thing without the bailor's consent (Article 658(1)).
3. A bailee cannot have a third party keep the bailed thing in custody without the bailor's consent or a compelling reason (Article 658(2)).
4. A sub-bailee has the same rights and obligations as the bailee towards the bailor within their scope of authority (Article 658(3)).

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given that we need to assess whether a query logically follows from these articles, let's consider what would make a query valid or invalid:

- A query is valid ("Y") if it aligns with the principles and rules outlined in the factored points.
- A query is invalid ("N") if it contradicts any of the outlined principles or introduces elements not covered by the articles.

Without a specific query to evaluate, we can't directly respond with "Y" or "N". However, based on the instructions provided:

If a query were to ask, for example, "Can a bailee use a bailed item without permission?", this would be invalid ("N") because it directly contradicts Article 658(1), which states that a bailee may not use the bailed thing without obtaining the consent of the bailor.

Conversely, if a query asked, "Does a sub-bailee have obligations towards the bailor similar to those of the bailee?", this would be valid ("Y") as it aligns with Article 658(3), indicating that a sub-bailee indeed has the same rights and obligations as the bailee in relation to the bailor within their scope of authority.

Given the nature of your request, I'm assuming you want an explanation on how to evaluate queries against these articles rather than evaluating a specific query. If you provide a specific query, I can offer a more direct assessment based on the factored points and the legal context they establish.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided articles, I'll generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: Possessory rights can be acquired through an agent as per Article 181, making this scenario legally valid.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: A bailee using the bailed thing without the bailor's consent directly contradicts Article 658(1), rendering this scenario invalid.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: Having a third party keep the bailed thing in custody without the bailor's consent or a compelling reason violates Article 658(2), making this scenario invalid.

4. (4 | Y) 
Justification: A sub-bailee having the same rights and obligations as the bailee towards the bailor within their scope of authority, as stated in Article 658(3), makes this scenario legally valid.

5. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Although possessory rights can be acquired through an agent (Article 181), using the bailed thing without consent (contradicting Article 658(1)) renders this combination invalid.

6. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Even though possessory rights can be acquired through an agent, having a third party keep the bailed thing without consent or a compelling reason (violating Article 658(2)) makes this scenario invalid.

7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Both factors are valid according to their respective articles (Article 181 and Article 658(3)), making this combination legally valid.

8. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: This combination involves two violations: using the bailed thing without consent (Article 658(1)) and having a third party keep it without consent or a compelling reason (Article 658(2)), rendering it invalid.

9. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although a sub-bailee has rights and obligations similar to the bailee (Article 658(3)), using the bailed thing without consent (contradicting Article 658(1)) makes this scenario invalid.

10. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: In a scenario where a third party keeps the bailed thing with a compelling reason (thus not violating Article 658(2)) and the sub-bailee acts within their authority similar to the bailee (Article 658(3)), this combination can be considered legally valid, assuming the compelling reason justifies the action under Article 658(2).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 1
The query discusses a scenario where person B, the depositary, enters into a deposit contract with person C for a moveable belonging to person A and transfers it. This involves an agent (person B) acting on behalf of the owner (person A), which relates to how possessory rights can be acquired or affected through agency. Thus, the query entails Factor 1.

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 2
The scenario explicitly mentions that person B gets approval from person A before entering into a contract with person C. This implies consent was obtained from the bailor (person A) before any action was taken by the bailee (person B), which aligns with Article 658(1). Therefore, the query entails Factor 2.

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 3
The query involves person B (the bailee) having a third party (person C) keep the bailed thing in custody after obtaining approval from person A. This action is consistent with Article 658(2), which allows for such an arrangement if the bailor's consent is obtained or there is a compelling reason. Since consent was mentioned, it entails Factor 3.

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 4
The query does not explicitly mention a sub-bailee or discuss the rights and obligations of a sub-bailee in relation to the bailor within their scope of authority. Thus, it does not directly entail Factor 4.

## Step 5: Determining Query Validity
Given that person B obtained approval from person A before transferring the moveable to person C, and considering the principles outlined in Article 658, the actions described (with consent and proper arrangement) do not inherently violate the principles of bailment as outlined. The query suggests a legally valid scenario under the conditions provided (consent and contractual agreement), which implies that the juridical acts (or obligations) are considered legally valid.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1)}$ 
The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 2)}$ 
The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 3)}$ 
The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query not entails 4)}$ 
The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 To address the given query, we first need to factor the provided article into its key components to understand the legal context it sets forth.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Intent Manifestation**: The agent must manifest the intention to possess a thing on behalf of the principal.
2. **Possession Under Own Possession**: The agent's manifestation is specifically about possessing the thing under their own possession but for the benefit of the principal.
3. **Acquisition of Possessory Rights**: As a result of the agent's action, the principal acquires possessory rights to the thing.
4. **Principal's Rights**: The focus is on how the principal gains legal rights over the item through the agent's actions.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors and considering the query about whether the statement logically follows from the provided article, we must analyze if the query aligns with the conditions and outcomes described in the article.


The query seems to ask for validation based on the given legal context without explicitly stating a scenario or condition. However, the question asks us to determine if a query is legally valid within the context of Article 183, which discusses how an agent's manifestation of intention to possess something on behalf of a principal leads to the principal acquiring possessory rights.


Without a specific query provided in the problem statement to directly apply these factors against, we must infer that any scenario where an agent manifests an intention to possess something for a principal, and thus the principal gains possessory rights, would be considered valid (Y) under this article. Conversely, scenarios not involving such manifestation or acquisition of rights through agency would not logically follow (N).


Given the lack of a specific query but understanding the structure of how these legal questions are typically evaluated, we can say that any statement directly reflecting the conditions and outcomes outlined in Article 183 regarding an agent's role in a principal acquiring possessory rights would be considered valid. Therefore, without a direct query to assess against the factors derived from Article 183, the logical approach is to affirm the validity of scenarios that fit within these defined parameters.


However, since there's no explicit query provided in your request to directly validate or invalidate based on Article 183, and considering the instruction format you've requested, I must clarify that without a specific scenario or statement to evaluate against the factored components of Article 183, we cannot conclusively label it as Y (Yes) or N (No). But for the sake of providing an answer in the required format based on typical applications of such legal principles:


The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors derived from Article 183, we'll consider different combinations of these factors. The factors are:

1. **Intent Manifestation**: The agent must manifest the intention to possess a thing on behalf of the principal.
2. **Possession Under Own Possession**: The agent's manifestation is specifically about possessing the thing under their own possession but for the benefit of the principal.
3. **Acquisition of Possessory Rights**: As a result of the agent's action, the principal acquires possessory rights to the thing.
4. **Principal's Rights**: The focus is on how the principal gains legal rights over the item through the agent's actions.

Here are 10 case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | Y) - In this scenario, the agent manifests the intention to possess a thing under their own possession on behalf of the principal. Since both intent manifestation and possession under own possession for the principal's benefit are present, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (3, 4 | Y) - Here, the acquisition of possessory rights by the principal and the focus on the principal's rights are considered. Given that these elements directly pertain to the outcome and subject of Article 183, the scenario is deemed legally valid.

3. (1 | N) - This case involves only the intent manifestation by the agent without any further actions or considerations regarding possession under their own possession for the principal's benefit or the acquisition of possessory rights. Since not all necessary elements are present, the act is considered invalid.

4. (2, 4 | Y) - The agent possesses a thing under their own possession for the principal's benefit, and there's a focus on the principal's rights. Although the intent manifestation is missing, if we assume that the possession itself implies an intention to hold for the principal, this could still be seen as legally valid under certain interpretations emphasizing the action over explicit intent.

5. (1, 3 | Y) - The agent manifests the intention, and the principal acquires possessory rights. This combination directly aligns with the core of Article 183, indicating a legally valid scenario.

6. (2 | N) - Possession under the agent's own possession for the principal's benefit without any manifestation of intent or consideration of the principal's rights or acquisition of possessory rights is insufficient to establish legal validity on its own.

7. (4 | N) - Focusing solely on the principal's rights without any actions by the agent (such as manifesting intention or acquiring possessory rights) does not meet the criteria for legal validity under Article 183.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - This scenario includes all elements: intent manifestation, possession under the agent's own possession for the principal, and the acquisition of possessory rights. It fully aligns with Article 183, making it legally valid.

9. (1, 4 | Y) - The agent manifests the intention to possess on behalf of the principal, and there's a focus on the principal's rights. Assuming that the manifestation of intent is sufficient to imply an action benefiting the principal, this scenario could be seen as legally valid, especially if it leads to the acquisition of possessory rights implicitly.

10. (2, 3 | Y) - The agent possesses a thing under their own possession for the principal's benefit, and the principal acquires possessory rights. Even without explicit intent manifestation mentioned, the action itself (possession for the principal's benefit leading to possessory rights acquisition) implies a level of intent, potentially making this scenario legally valid under the article's provisions.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 183, determining legal validity based on the presence and interaction of these elements.

### Waiting for Query


Once I receive the query, I will proceed with factoring and evaluation. 

(Please note that I'll add the factors list after receiving the query)
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided articles, I will generate 10 case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (I, II | Y) 
Justification: A landowner installs boundary markers and shares the expenses with the neighboring landowner, as stated in Article 223. The expenses of installation and preservation are borne equally by neighbors, according to Article 224. Therefore, this scenario is legally valid.

2. (III | Y) 
Justification: Boundary markers installed on boundary lines are presumed to be co-owned by the neighbors, as per Article 229. This implies that both landowners have a shared responsibility for the markers, making this scenario legally valid.

3. (I, III | Y) 
Justification: A landowner installs boundary markers and shares the expenses with the neighboring landowner (Article 223). Since these markers are presumed to be co-owned by the neighbors (Article 229), this scenario is legally valid.

4. (II | N) 
Justification: Article 224 states that measuring expenses are borne in proportion to the area of each land, but it does not provide a basis for determining the validity of the juridical act if only this factor is considered. However, since there's no clear indication of invalidity based solely on this article, and considering the context provided by other articles, this case might be considered as having insufficient information to determine validity. But given the instruction to choose between Y and N, we'll consider it as not being directly supported by the given conditions.

5. (I | Y) 
Justification: A landowner installs boundary markers and shares the expenses with the neighboring landowner, which is explicitly allowed by Article 223. Therefore, this scenario is legally valid.

6. (II, III | Y) 
Justification: The expenses of installation and preservation are borne equally by neighbors (Article 224), and boundary markers installed on boundary lines are presumed to be co-owned by the neighbors (Article 229). This combination supports a legally valid scenario because it respects both the financial and ownership aspects of boundary markers.

7. (I, II, III | Y) 
Justification: This scenario combines all factors: a landowner installs boundary markers and shares the expenses with the neighboring landowner (Article 223), the expenses are borne equally by neighbors except for measuring expenses which are proportional to land area (Article 224), and the markers are presumed co-owned (Article 229). Therefore, this comprehensive scenario is legally valid.

8. (None | N) 
Justification: Without any of the factors present, there's no basis in the provided articles to consider a juridical act or obligation as legally valid regarding boundary markers and expenses sharing between neighboring landowners.

9. (I, III, but not II due to disagreement on expense sharing | N) 
Justification: Although a landowner installs boundary markers and they are presumed to be co-owned by the neighbors (Articles 223 and 229), if there's a disagreement on how expenses are shared (contrary to Article 224), this could invalidate the arrangement as it does not follow the legal guidelines for expense sharing.

10. (II, but with disproportionate expense allocation | N) 
Justification: If measuring expenses are not borne in proportion to the area of each land as required by Article 224, but instead are allocated disproportionately, this would violate the principles outlined in the article and thus be considered legally invalid.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors and their implications on the legal validity of the juridical act based on the provided articles.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To evaluate the given query against the provided legal articles and determine its validity, we first need to factor the relevant information into a list of factors based on the articles provided.


### Factors:
1. **Article 223**: A landowner may install boundary markers, sharing the expenses with the owner of the neighboring land.
2. **Article 224**: The expenses of installation and preservation of boundary markers are borne equally by neighbors; however, measuring expenses are borne in proportion to the area of each land.
3. **Article 229**: Boundary markers, fences, walls, channels, and moats installed on boundary lines are presumed to be co-owned by the neighbors.


### Query:
An owner of one part of neighboring land may demand the cooperation of another owner of the land in installing boundary markers at shared cost, and the boundary markers installed as a result of that cooperation shall be presumed to be co-owned by the neighbors.


### Task 1 Evaluation:
- The query entails **Factor 1** because it mentions demanding cooperation for installing boundary markers at a shared cost, which aligns with Article 223.
- The query entails **Factor 2** partially, as it talks about shared costs but does not specifically mention the proportion of expenses based on land area or measuring expenses.
- The query entails **Factor 3** because it states that the installed boundary markers shall be presumed to be co-owned by the neighbors, aligning with Article 229.


### Task 2 Evaluation:
Based on the provided legal articles (Article 223, Article 224, and Article 229), the query is describing a scenario where an owner demands cooperation for installing boundary markers at a shared cost, and these markers are presumed to be co-owned. This description aligns with the principles outlined in the articles, particularly Article 223 regarding shared expenses for boundary markers and Article 229 regarding the presumption of co-ownership of such markers.


### Conclusion:
Given that the query describes a scenario consistent with the legal principles outlined in Articles 223 and 229, and considering the factors derived from these articles, we conclude:


**(Query entails Factor 1)**  
**(Query entails Factor 3)**  
**(Query Valid)**


This conclusion is based on the alignment of the query with the relevant legal articles regarding shared expenses for boundary markers and the presumption of co-ownership.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context of the provided article, we must first break down the article into its key components or factors. Then, we compare these factors with the query to assess validity.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Distance Requirement**: The building must be at least 50 centimeters away from the boundary line.
2. **Consequence of Non-Compliance**: If a building is constructed in violation of the distance requirement, the neighboring landowner can have the construction suspended or changed.
3. **Time Limit for Action**: The neighboring landowner has one year from the start of construction to take action against the violation; after this period, they can only claim compensation if the building is completed.
4. **Right to Compensation**: After one year from the start of construction or upon completion of the building, the neighboring landowner's recourse is limited to claiming compensation for any loss or damage.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given this factoring and without a specific query provided, it's essential to note that any query regarding Article 234 would need to be evaluated against these factors. For instance:

- A query stating that a building can be constructed right on the boundary line without repercussions would be invalid (N) because it contradicts Factor 1.
- A query suggesting that a neighboring landowner cannot take action against a violating construction until after it's completed would also be invalid (N) as it misinterprets Factors 2 and 3.
- A query stating that extinctive prescription does not apply in cases of building construction disputes near boundary lines is irrelevant to Article 234, which focuses on physical distance requirements and neighboring landowners' rights, making it an invalid comparison (N).

Without a specific query, we must consider the structure and implications of Article 234 to understand how future queries might be evaluated for legal validity. Each factor plays a crucial role in determining the legality of actions taken under this article, particularly concerning building construction near boundary lines and the rights of neighboring landowners.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors from Article 234:


1. (1 | N) 
Justification: The building was constructed only 30 centimeters away from the boundary line, violating the distance requirement of at least 50 centimeters. This action is invalid.


2. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: A neighboring landowner had construction suspended due to a violation of the distance requirement within one year of its start, which aligns with their rights under Article 234. This action is valid.


3. (4 | N) 
Justification: After two years from the start of construction and completion of the building, the neighboring landowner sought to have it demolished instead of claiming compensation. Since more than a year has passed, this action exceeds their legal recourse. This action is invalid.


4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: A building was constructed right on the boundary line, but the neighboring landowner successfully had its construction suspended due to the violation. This outcome aligns with Article 234's provisions for addressing non-compliance. This action is valid.


5. (3 | N) 
Justification: The neighboring landowner waited two years after the start of construction before attempting to take any action against the violating building, which exceeds the one-year time limit for suspension or change. This action is invalid.


6. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Although a building was constructed too close to the boundary line, the neighboring landowner chose to claim compensation after its completion instead of attempting to suspend construction. Given that more than a year had passed since construction began, this recourse is within their legal rights. This action is valid.


7. (2 | Y) 
Justification: The neighboring landowner successfully petitioned for the suspension of construction that was being built too close to the boundary line, which directly aligns with their rights under Article 234. This action is valid.


8. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: After one year and three months from the start of a violating construction, the neighboring landowner opted for claiming compensation instead of suspension or change, recognizing that the time for those actions had passed. This decision aligns with their available legal options under Article 234 after the specified time limit. This action is valid.


9. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: A building was constructed 20 centimeters from the boundary line, and the neighboring landowner attempted to have it changed one year and six months after its completion. Although the initial construction violated Article 234, attempting to change it after more than a year since its start is beyond their legal right at this stage. This action is invalid.


10. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The neighboring landowner initially had a violating building's construction suspended within the one-year time frame but later decided to claim compensation for damages instead of pursuing further action against the building itself after its completion. This sequence of actions respects the rights and limitations outlined in Article 234. This action is valid.


Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors from Article 234, assessing whether the resulting juridical act or obligations are legally valid based on those factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factors
To assess whether the query entails each factor, we must compare the query's statements with the factors derived from Article 234. The query states that after a year lapses from the start of construction or if the building is completed, the owner of adjacent land may not demand changes to the building and may only claim damages.

## Step 2: Evaluating Entailment of Factor 1
Factor 1 concerns the distance requirement of at least 50 centimeters from the boundary line. The query does not directly address this factor but rather discusses consequences after construction has begun or been completed, implying a potential violation of this distance but not explicitly stating it.

## Step 3: Evaluating Entailment of Factor 2
Factor 2 deals with the consequence of non-compliance, where the neighboring landowner can have the construction suspended or changed. The query suggests that after a certain point (a year lapsing or completion), the owner may not demand changes, which aligns with but also adds specificity to this factor by discussing what happens after the initial period of construction.

## Step 4: Evaluating Entailment of Factor 3
Factor 3 is about the time limit for action, stating that the neighboring landowner has one year from the start of construction to take action. The query directly mentions that after a year lapses from the time when such construction started, or if that building has been completed, certain actions are limited, which aligns with this factor.

## Step 5: Evaluating Entailment of Factor 4
Factor 4 concerns the right to compensation after one year or upon completion. The query states that the owner may only claim damages after these conditions are met, directly aligning with this factor.

## Step 6: Conclusion on Query Entailment
Based on the analysis:
- (Query entails 2) because it discusses the consequence of non-compliance in terms of demanding changes.
- (Query entails 3) as it mentions the time limit after which certain actions are no longer possible.
- (Query entails 4) since it talks about claiming damages after a year or completion, aligning with the right to compensation.

## Step 7: Assessing Query Validity
The query essentially describes a scenario where the juridical acts (or obligations) concerning building construction near boundary lines are outlined in accordance with Article 234. It specifies what happens after certain conditions are met (a year lapses or the building is completed), which directly reflects the content of Article 234 without contradicting it.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To evaluate the validity of a query with respect to Article 209, we must first factor the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Request for Use**: An owner of land can request to use neighboring land.
2. **Purpose of Request**: The purpose is for constructing or repairing walls or buildings near the boundary.
3. **Limitation on Entry**: The owner cannot enter the neighbor's dwelling house without approval.
4. **Compensation for Damage**: If damage occurs, the neighbor can claim compensation.
5. **Context of Use**: The use is limited to what is necessary for the specified purposes.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we need a query to evaluate its validity against Article 209. However, since no specific query was provided for Article 209, I will create a hypothetical query based on the content of the article and then assess its validity.

Hypothetical Query: "A landowner can enter a neighbor's dwelling without permission to repair a shared boundary wall."

To determine if this query is legally valid with the context of Article 209:

- The article explicitly states that an owner may not enter the dwelling house of the neighbor without approval (Factor 3). 
- The purpose of the request (constructing or repairing walls or buildings) does not automatically grant permission to enter a dwelling (Factors 2 and 5).
- Compensation for damage is relevant but does not pertain to the legality of entering a dwelling without permission (Factor 4).

Given these points, the query about entering a neighbor's dwelling without permission to repair a shared boundary wall contradicts Factor 3. Therefore, it does not logically follow the legal context provided by Article 209.

Response: N

Explanation: The factor that causes the query to invalidate the article is the explicit limitation on entering a neighbor's dwelling house without approval (Factor 3), which directly contradicts the scenario presented in the hypothetical query.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 209, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The landowner has made a request for use (Factor 1) and the purpose is for constructing or repairing walls or buildings near the boundary (Factor 2), which aligns with the article's provision.

2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: The owner enters the neighbor's dwelling house without approval (contradicting Factor 3) and claims no damage occurred to avoid compensation (Factor 4), making the action invalid due to the unauthorized entry.

3. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The landowner requests use of neighboring land (Factor 1) and limits the use to what is necessary for constructing or repairing walls or buildings near the boundary (Factor 5), adhering to the article's conditions.

4. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the purpose of the request is legitimate (constructing or repairing, Factor 2), entering the neighbor's dwelling house without approval (contradicting Factor 3) renders the action invalid.

5. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The scenario involves potential damage for which compensation can be claimed (Factor 4), and the use of neighboring land is limited to what is necessary (Factor 5), aligning with the article's provisions regarding compensation and necessity.

6. (1, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Despite making a legitimate request for use (Factor 1) and potentially causing damage that could be compensated (Factor 4), entering the dwelling house without approval (contradicting Factor 3) invalidates the action.

7. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The purpose of constructing or repairing walls or buildings near the boundary (Factor 2) combined with limiting the use to what is necessary (Factor 5) makes the scenario valid under Article 209.

8. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Even though there's a legitimate request for use (Factor 1), a valid purpose (Factor 2), entering the neighbor's dwelling house without approval (contradicting Factor 3) makes the action invalid.

9. (4, 1 | Y) 
Justification: The possibility of claiming compensation for damage (Factor 4) and making a request for use of neighboring land (Factor 1) are both in line with Article 209's provisions.

10. (5, 2, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the use is limited to what is necessary (Factor 5), there's a valid purpose (Factor 2), and consideration for compensation (Factor 4), entering the dwelling house without approval (contradicting Factor 3) renders the entire scenario invalid.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks based on the provided query and factors related to Article 209:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "If an owner of one part of neighboring land repairs a building on the owned land, then he/she may request the use of the neighboring land to the extent necessary for repairing the building from his/her neighbor, however he/she may not enter the dwelling house of the neighbor without the approval the same."

Let's assess each factor:

1. **Request for Use**: The query mentions requesting the use of neighboring land, so (Query entails 1).
2. **Purpose of Request**: The purpose is for repairing a building, which aligns with the article, so (Query entails 2).
3. **Limitation on Entry**: The query explicitly states that the owner may not enter the dwelling house without approval, so (Query entails 3).
4. **Compensation for Damage**: The query does not mention compensation for damage, so (Query not entails 4).
5. **Context of Use**: The use is for repairing a building, which implies it's to the extent necessary, so (Query entails 5).

### Task 2:
The query essentially rephrases and aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 209 without introducing any contradictions or invalidations. It correctly states that an owner can request to use neighboring land for repairs but must not enter the neighbor's dwelling house without approval.

Therefore, based on this analysis, (Query Valid).

 ### Begin Factoring
1. The article discusses the partition of land and access to public roads.
2. If a parcel of land has no access to public roads after partition, the owner may pass through another person's land with compensation.
3. The same rules apply if the owner transfers part of their land to another person.
4. The article implies that compensation is necessary for accessing public roads through someone else's land.
5. The scenario involves two parties: the owner of the parcel without access and the owner of the land through which they must pass.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

To determine if a query is legally valid with the context of the article, we need to analyze whether it aligns with these factors. However, since no specific query is provided for evaluation against Article 213, I will create a hypothetical query based on common legal concerns related to land partition and access:

Query: "If a landowner's parcel has no direct access to public roads after a partition, can they use an adjacent landowner's property as a right of way without paying compensation?"

Given the factors extracted from Article 213:
- The article explicitly states that if the partition of land creates a parcel with no access to public roads, the owner may pass through another person's land but must pay compensation (Factor 2).
- Compensation is necessary for such access (Factor 4).

The query suggests a scenario where compensation might not be paid, which contradicts Factor 4. Therefore, based on the factors extracted and the hypothetical query:

Response: N

Explanation: The response is "N" because the query implies accessing another person's land without paying compensation, which directly contradicts the requirement stated in Article 213 that compensation must be paid for such access. This contradiction indicates that the query does not logically follow the legal context provided by the article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 213, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will consider a different combination of factors and provide a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves the partition of land creating a parcel with no access to public roads (Factor 1), and the owner may pass through another person's land with compensation (Factor 2). Since both conditions are met as per Article 213, the act is legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y)
Justification: This case involves the transfer of part of the land to another person (Factor 3), and it implies two parties are involved: the owner of the parcel without access and the owner of the land through which they must pass (Factor 5). Given that the same rules apply for transfers as for partitions (as per Article 213), and considering the involvement of two necessary parties, the act is legally valid.

3. (1, 4 | N)
Justification: Although this scenario involves the partition of land creating a parcel with no access to public roads (Factor 1) and implies that compensation is necessary for accessing public roads through someone else's land (Factor 4), it lacks the direct application of passing through another person's land. Without explicit mention of using another's land, the necessity for compensation alone does not validate the act without considering access arrangements.

4. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: This case directly involves a parcel of land with no access to public roads after partition, where the owner may pass through another person's land with compensation (Factor 2), and it clearly involves two parties (Factor 5). Since both conditions are explicitly covered by Article 213, including the payment of compensation for accessing through another's land, the act is legally valid.

5. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: While this scenario involves transferring part of the land to another person (Factor 3) and implies that compensation is necessary for accessing public roads through someone else's land (Factor 4), it does not explicitly state that such access was granted or agreed upon by both parties. Without clear agreement on using another's land as a right of way, the act cannot be deemed legally valid solely based on these factors.

6. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: This case involves the partition of land creating a parcel with no access to public roads (Factor 1) and the transfer of part of the land to another person (Factor 3). Given that the article's provisions apply mutatis mutandis to transfers, implying similar rules for access, the act can be considered legally valid as it falls under scenarios where access arrangements would need to be made, potentially involving compensation.

7. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: Although this scenario involves the necessity of compensation for accessing public roads through someone else's land (Factor 4) and two parties are involved (Factor 5), it lacks explicit mention of how the parcel became inaccessible or the legal basis for requiring compensation without an agreed-upon access arrangement. Thus, without a clear cause for needing to access another's land or an agreement on such access, the act is not legally valid based solely on these factors.

8. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This case involves a parcel of land with no direct access to public roads after partition, where the owner may pass through another person's land with compensation (Factor 2), and it applies the same rules for when an owner transfers part of their land to another person (Factor 3). Since both conditions directly relate to Article 213's stipulations on access and compensation, regardless of whether the situation arose from partition or transfer, the act is legally valid.

9. (1, 5 | N)
Justification: While this scenario involves the partition of land creating a parcel with no access to public roads (Factor 1) and implies two parties are involved (Factor 5), it does not explicitly address how the owner of the inaccessible parcel will access public roads or if compensation is involved. Without details on the method of accessing another's land or agreements regarding such access, including potential compensation, the act cannot be deemed legally valid.

10. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: This case directly involves a scenario where a parcel has no access to public roads after partition, and the owner may pass through another person's land with compensation (Factor 2), which aligns with the necessity of paying compensation for such access (Factor 4). Given that both factors explicitly support the conditions outlined in Article 213 for accessing another's land as a right of way with due compensation, the act is legally valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and provides a clear justification based on Article 213's stipulations regarding land partition, access to public roads, and the necessity of compensation.

1. The article discusses the partition of land and access to public roads.
   - (Query entails 1)
2. If a parcel of land has no access to public roads after partition, the owner may pass through another person's land with compensation.
   - (Query not entails 2) because the query does not mention compensation for passing through another person's land; it incorrectly limits the right-of-way to land N without discussing access through other lands with compensation.
3. The same rules apply if the owner transfers part of their land to another person.
   - (Query entails 3) since the scenario involves transferring part of the land (land M) to another person (person B).
4. The article implies that compensation is necessary for accessing public roads through someone else's land.
   - (Query not entails 4) because it does not mention anything about paying compensation for the right-of-way, which is a crucial aspect of accessing public roads through another's land according to Article 213.
5. The scenario involves two parties: the owner of the parcel without access and the owner of the land through which they must pass.
   - (Query entails 5) as it involves person B (the new owner of land M, which has no access) and implicitly requires passing through another's land to reach public roads.

# Task 2:
Given that the query suggests person B has a right-of-way only regarding land N without mentioning compensation or the possibility of accessing public roads through other lands with compensation, it misinterprets the legal context provided by Article 213. Therefore, the query does not accurately reflect the legally valid scenario as described in the article.

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement based on Article 295, we first need to factor the article into its key components.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Possessor's Right**: The possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a right to retain that thing.
2. **Claim Requirement**: This right is contingent upon the possessor having a claim related to the retained thing.
3. **Due Date Condition**: The claim must have fallen due for the retention right to be exercised.
4. **Tortious Act Exception**: If possession was gained through a tortious act, the retention right does not apply.
5. **Retention Purpose**: The purpose of retention is until the claim is satisfied.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we can analyze any query to determine if it logically follows from Article 295 by checking which factors are present or missing in the query. 

Without a specific query provided, I will demonstrate how this factoring could be used with a hypothetical query: "A possessor who obtained an item through theft can retain it until their claim related to that item is satisfied."

Analyzing this query:
- It violates factor 4 (Tortious Act Exception), as possession commenced by means of a tortious act (theft).
- Thus, the query does not logically follow from Article 295 because it ignores the exception for tortious acts.

Therefore, the response to such a query would be "N" due to the violation of the tortious act exception. 

Please provide a specific query related to Article 295 for a detailed analysis and determination of its legal validity according to the article's context.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors of Article 295, we will systematically combine these factors in different ways, ensuring no two cases are the same. The factors are:

1. **Possessor's Right**
2. **Claim Requirement**
3. **Due Date Condition**
4. **Tortious Act Exception**
5. **Retention Purpose**

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - A possessor has a right to retain an item belonging to another because they have a claim related to that item and the claim has fallen due, intending to keep it until the claim is satisfied.

2. (1, 2, 5 | Y) - A possessor can legally retain an item belonging to someone else if they have a claim related to the item and intend to keep it until the claim is satisfied, regardless of the due date.

3. (4 | N) - If possession commenced through a tortious act, the right to retention does not apply, making any attempt to retain the item based on this factor alone invalid.

4. (1, 3 | Y) - A possessor with a claim that has fallen due can retain an item belonging to another until their claim is satisfied, exercising their right as a possessor.

5. (2, 5 | N) - Without considering the due date condition or the legitimacy of possession, merely having a claim related to an item and intending to retain it until the claim is satisfied does not suffice for legal retention.

6. (1, 4 | N) - Even if a possessor has a right to retain an item, if the possession began through a tortious act, this right does not apply, making retention invalid.

7. (3, 5 | Y) - If a claim has fallen due and the intention is to retain the item until the claim is satisfied, the conditions for legal retention are met, assuming other factors align.

8. (2, 4 | N) - Having a claim related to an item does not justify retaining it if the possession was gained through a tortious act, as this act overrides any potential right to retention based on a claim.

9. (1, 2, 4 | N) - Even with a possessor's right and a claim related to the item, if the possession commenced through a tortious act, the retention is not legally valid.

10. (3, 4 | N) - The combination of a claim having fallen due and possession being gained through a tortious act means that while one condition for retention is met, the overriding factor of a tortious act makes retention invalid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 295, determining the legal validity of the retention based on the presence or absence of specific conditions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing the Query for Each Factor
To determine if the query entails each factor, we must analyze it in relation to the factors derived from Article 295.

- For factor 1 (**Possessor's Right**), the query mentions that "A right of retention is not established," which directly relates to the possessor's right to retain an item.
- For factor 2 (**Claim Requirement**), the query specifies "the obligee with a secured claim," indicating the presence of a claim related to the retained thing.
- For factor 3 (**Due Date Condition**), there's no explicit mention of the claim having fallen due, which might suggest this factor is not directly addressed in the query.
- For factor 4 (**Tortious Act Exception**), the query states "even if he/she temporarily has possession, the right shall not be established in cases where the possession commenced by means of a tortious act," clearly addressing this exception.
- For factor 5 (**Retention Purpose**), while the purpose of retention (until the claim is satisfied) is not explicitly mentioned in the query, it's implied through the discussion of the right of retention.

## Step 2: Determining Entailment for Each Factor
Based on the analysis:
- The query entails factor 1 because it discusses the establishment of a right of retention.
- The query entails factor 2 as it mentions a secured claim.
- The query does not explicitly entail factor 3 since it doesn't specify that the claim has fallen due.
- The query entails factor 4 by mentioning the exception for tortious acts.
- The query implies but does not directly entail factor 5, as the purpose of retention is not the main focus.

## Step 3: Evaluating Query Validity
To assess if the query is valid or invalid according to Article 295:
- The query states conditions under which a right of retention is not established, aligning with exceptions and conditions outlined in Article 295, particularly regarding possession through tortious acts and the requirement for a claim.
- It does not assert the validity of juridical acts or obligations outside these specific conditions but rather clarifies when such rights do not apply.

## Step 4: Conclusion on Query Validity
Given that the query aligns with the principles outlined in Article 295 by specifying conditions under which a right of retention is not established, particularly focusing on the exceptions, it can be considered to express a legally valid perspective within the context provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

1. **Possession and Claim**: The possessor of a thing belonging to another person can retain that thing if they have a claim related to it.
2. **Condition for Retention**: The claim must have arisen in relation to the thing being possessed.
3. **Due Date of Claim**: The right to retain does not apply if the relevant claim has not yet fallen due.
4. **Exclusion Due to Tortious Act**: Possession commenced by a tortious act excludes the application of the retention right.
5. **Retention Until Satisfied**: The possessor can retain the thing until their claim is satisfied.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we are asked to evaluate the validity of a query but no specific query is provided for Article 295, I'll proceed with a general explanation based on the factored components. 

For a query to be considered legally valid (Y) within the context of Article 295, it must align with these factors without introducing elements that contradict them or omitting crucial conditions stipulated in the article. For instance, if a query suggests that a possessor can retain a thing belonging to another even though their claim has not yet fallen due, it would be considered invalid (N) because it directly contradicts factor 3.

Similarly, if a query implies that the right of retention applies regardless of how possession was obtained, including through tortious acts, it would also be invalid (N) as it disregards factor 4. 

Conversely, a query that respects all conditions and factors outlined in Article 295, such as acknowledging the necessity for a claim to have arisen from the thing possessed and for that claim to have fallen due, would be considered valid (Y).

Without a specific query provided to assess against these factors, any general statement about the validity of queries concerning Article 295 must consider whether it adheres to or violates these outlined principles.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 295, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The possessor has a claim related to the thing and the claim arose in relation to that thing, which satisfies the conditions for retention.

2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the claim has not yet fallen due and possession was commenced by a tortious act, the combination of these factors does not justify retention because both conditions for invalidating retention are met.

3. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The possessor can retain the thing until their claim is satisfied, given that they have a claim related to the thing and can hold it until satisfaction.

4. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Even if the claim arose in relation to the thing, the fact that the claim has not yet fallen due invalidates the right to retain.

5. (1, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Despite having a claim related to the thing and it arising from the thing, both the claim not having fallen due and possession being commenced by a tortious act render retention invalid.

6. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The claim arose in relation to the thing, and the possessor can retain it until the claim is satisfied, fulfilling the conditions for valid retention.

7. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: Possession commenced by a tortious act excludes the application of the retention right, regardless of the intention to retain until satisfaction.

8. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although all initial conditions for retention are met (possession and claim, claim arising from the thing), the claim not having fallen due is sufficient to invalidate retention.

9. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: If possession was commenced by a tortious act, the right to retain does not apply, even if there's a claim related to the thing.

10. (2, 3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The combination of factors here includes a claim arising from the thing and the intention to retain until satisfaction, but the claim not having fallen due is enough to render retention invalid.

Each case considers a unique combination of factors to determine whether the juridical act of retaining a thing belonging to another person is legally valid or not.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factors
The query "A right of retention is not established when a secured claim has not yet fallen due" directly relates to the conditions under which a possessor can retain a thing belonging to another person. Specifically, it touches on the condition regarding the due date of the claim.

## Step 2: Identifying Relevant Factors
From the factored components of Article 295, factor 3 ("Due Date of Claim": The right to retain does not apply if the relevant claim has not yet fallen due) is directly relevant to the query. This factor explicitly states that the right of retention is contingent upon the claim having fallen due.

## Step 3: Evaluating Query Entailment
Given the query's statement about the conditions under which a right of retention is not established, it aligns with factor 3, as both address the importance of the claim's due date in determining the validity of retaining possession.

## Step 4: Determining Query Validity
The query essentially reflects a condition outlined in Article 295 regarding when a right of retention cannot be exercised. Since it accurately represents a scenario where the juridical act (or obligation) is legally invalid according to the article, we can determine its validity based on this alignment.

## Step 5: Conclusion on Query Entailment and Validity
The query entails factor 3 because it directly addresses the condition related to the due date of the claim. Given that the query accurately reflects a principle from Article 295 without introducing contradictions or omitting crucial conditions, we can assess its validity in the context provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 3)}$

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to Article 297, we first need to factor the article into its key components. Then, we'll analyze these factors in relation to the query to determine if it logically follows from the article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Right of Retention**: The article discusses the rights and actions of a holder of a right of retention.
2. **Collection of Fruits**: The holder can collect fruits (likely referring to profits or products) derived from the thing retained.
3. **Priority of Claim Satisfaction**: The holder can appropriate these fruits to satisfy their own claim before other obligees.
4. **Interest Payment Priority**: The fruits collected must first be used to pay interest on the claim.
5. **Principal Satisfaction**: After paying interest, any remainder is applied to satisfying the principal amount of the claim.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors and without a specific query provided to assess against Article 297 directly, we must infer the process for evaluating a query's validity:

- If a query aligns with the factors outlined (e.g., discussing how a right of retention allows for the collection of fruits from the retained property, or how these fruits are prioritized for interest and then principal payment), it would be considered valid ("Y").
- Conversely, if a query contradicts these factors or introduces concepts not covered by Article 297 (such as disputing the order of claim satisfaction or introducing unrelated legal principles), it would be invalid ("N").

To provide a concrete answer, a specific query related to Article 297 is needed. However, based on the process outlined and without a direct query to assess, we can't definitively conclude with a "Y" or "N" at this stage. The approach would involve comparing the query against the factored elements of Article 297 to determine its validity within the context provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 297, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The holder of a right of retention can collect fruits derived from the thing retained, which is a fundamental aspect of their rights. Therefore, if only factors 1 (Right of Retention) and 2 (Collection of Fruits) are present, the juridical act is still legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Even without the explicit collection of fruits, the priority of claim satisfaction (factor 3) and the application of any remainder to the principal (factor 5) can still be legally valid, as these aspects are integral to the rights of the holder.

3. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If the holder collects fruits (factor 2) and these must first be used to pay interest on the claim (factor 4), this process aligns with the article's stipulations regarding the use of collected fruits for interest payment before principal satisfaction.

4. (1, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of the right of retention (factor 1), the priority of claim satisfaction (factor 3), and the application to the principal (factor 5) together form a coherent and legally valid scenario, as these factors directly relate to the core aspects of Article 297.

5. (4 | N) 
Justification: If only factor 4 (Interest Payment Priority) is present without any context of collection or retention rights, it lacks the foundational elements necessary for legal validity under Article 297.

6. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The ability to collect fruits (factor 2) and appropriate them to satisfy one's own claim before others (factor 3) is a key aspect of the right of retention, making this combination legally valid.

7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Even if only the right of retention (factor 1) and the priority for interest payment (factor 4) are considered, the scenario can still be seen as legally valid because it involves fundamental rights and obligations outlined in Article 297.

8. (5 | N) 
Justification: If only factor 5 (Principal Satisfaction) is present without any preceding factors regarding retention, collection, or priority for interest, it lacks necessary context for legal validity under the article.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of the right of retention (factor 1), collection of fruits (factor 2), and priority of claim satisfaction (factor 3) forms a complete and legally valid scenario, as it encompasses the core aspects of how a holder can utilize their rights.

10. (2, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes the collection of fruits (factor 2), the use of these fruits for interest payment (factor 4), and any remainder applied to the principal (factor 5), which directly follows the stipulated process in Article 297, making it legally valid.

 To address the tasks as defined:

# Task 1:
Given the query: "A holder of a right of retention may not accept priority performance from the subject matter, but may accept priority performance from fruits that derived from the subject matter."

Assessing against each factor:
- (Query entails 1) because it mentions the "holder of a right of retention."
- (Query entails 2) since it talks about accepting performance from "fruits that derived from the subject matter," implying collection of fruits.
- (Query entails 3) as it discusses priority in relation to the holder's claim, though inversely by stating what is not accepted.
- (Query entails 4) indirectly because it implies a distinction in how priorities are handled, but doesn't directly address interest payment priority.
- (Query entails 5) similarly indirect, as principal satisfaction is implied in discussions of priority performance but not explicitly addressed.

# Task 2:
The query does not explicitly state that the juridical acts or obligations described are legally valid or invalid within the context provided by Article 297. It presents a scenario without affirming its legality under Article 297's provisions directly. Therefore, based on the information given and the process for evaluation outlined:

(Query Invalid)

This conclusion is drawn because the query introduces a condition ("may not accept priority performance from the subject matter") that isn't explicitly covered by Article 297 as factored, suggesting a potential contradiction or at least an unaddressed aspect within the provided legal framework.

 To evaluate the query, we first need to factor the given article into its key components and then assess whether the query logically follows from these factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Existence of Statutory Lien**: The article establishes that a statutory lien exists for a lessor of land or a building.
2. **Scope of Statutory Lien for Land**: The lien for a lessor of land applies to movables furnished to the land, movables provided for the use of the land, and fruits of the land in the possession of the lessee.
3. **Scope of Statutory Lien for Buildings**: The lien for a lessor of a building applies to movables furnished to that building by the lessee.
4. **Specificity of Application**: The article specifies different applications of the statutory lien based on whether the lease is for land or a building.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we can now assess any query against the context provided by Article 313 to determine if it is legally valid. However, since no specific query was provided to evaluate against the article, I will demonstrate how to apply this factoring to a hypothetical query:

- Hypothetical Query: "A lessor of land has a statutory lien against movables furnished to the lessee's house on that land."
  
Given the factors:
- The existence of a statutory lien is established (Factor 1).
- The scope of the statutory lien for land includes movables furnished to the land (Factor 2), which could be interpreted to include buildings and their contents if they are considered part of the "movables furnished to that land."
  
However, without explicit mention of buildings or structures in Factor 2, and considering Factor 3 specifically addresses movables furnished to a building by the lessee, there might be ambiguity. The query seems to blend elements of both land and building liens.

Thus, based on the factors provided and without further clarification from additional articles or legal context, one might argue that the query could potentially be valid but requires careful interpretation of "movables furnished to that land" to include structures like houses. However, since no direct query was given for evaluation, this explanation serves as a methodological approach rather than a conclusive validation or invalidation.

For an actual query, a detailed analysis against these factors would determine if the query logically follows from the article's context, leading to a response of "Y" if it does and "N" if it does not.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 313, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of these factors occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. **(1 | Y)**: In this scenario, only the existence of a statutory lien (Factor 1) is considered. Since the article establishes that a statutory lien exists for a lessor of land or a building, this factor alone supports the validity of the juridical act regarding the existence of such a lien.

2. **(2 | Y)**: Considering only the scope of the statutory lien for land (Factor 2), which includes movables furnished to the land, movables provided for its use, and fruits of the land in the lessee's possession, this scenario is legally valid because it directly applies to the lessor's rights over specified items.

3. **(3 | Y)**: Focusing on the scope of the statutory lien for a building (Factor 3), which applies to movables furnished by the lessee, indicates that the lien is legally valid in scenarios involving buildings and their associated movables.

4. **(1, 2 | Y)**: Combining the existence of a statutory lien (Factor 1) with its scope regarding land (Factor 2) reinforces the legal validity of the lien against specified movables and fruits related to the leased land.

5. **(1, 3 | Y)**: The combination of the existence of a statutory lien (Factor 1) and its application to buildings (Factor 3) supports the legal validity of the lien in the context of buildings and their associated movables furnished by the lessee.

6. **(2, 3 | N)**: Considering both the scope of the lien for land (Factor 2) and for buildings (Factor 3) without acknowledging the foundational existence of a statutory lien (Factor 1) or specificity of application (Factor 4) might lead to confusion regarding what items are covered. However, since Factor 2 specifically mentions movables related to the land and Factor 3 talks about movables furnished to the building by the lessee, both scenarios where these factors apply individually could be seen as valid in their respective contexts. But for simplicity and clarity in direct application without Factor 1 or 4, this might not directly validate a specific juridical act without further context.

7. **(1, 2, 3 | Y)**: Including all factors related to the existence (Factor 1), scope for land (Factor 2), and scope for buildings (Factor 3) provides a comprehensive basis for determining the legal validity of a statutory lien in various contexts, making this scenario legally valid.

8. **(4 | N)**: Considering only the specificity of application (Factor 4), which distinguishes between leases for land and buildings without reference to the existence or scope of the lien, does not provide enough information to determine the legal validity of a specific juridical act.

9. **(1, 4 | Y)**: Combining the existence of a statutory lien (Factor 1) with the specificity of its application (Factor 4) indicates that the lien's legal framework is acknowledged and understood to apply differently based on whether the lease is for land or a building, supporting legal validity.

10. **(2, 4 | Y)**: The scope of the statutory lien for land (Factor 2) combined with the specificity of application (Factor 4) clarifies that the lien applies to movables and fruits associated with the leased land, distinguishing it from leases of buildings. This clarity supports the legal validity of the juridical act in this context.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and their implications for the legal validity of the statutory lien based on Article 313.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we must first factor the article into its key components or factors. The provided article pertains to statutory liens and their application to various forms of compensation or value that an obligor might receive in relation to the subject matter of the lien.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Statutory Lien Definition**: A statutory lien can be exercised against things, including monies, related to the sale, lease, loss, or damage of the subject matter.
2. **Condition for Exercising the Lien**: The holder must attach the monies or other things before their payment or delivery.
3. **Application to Real Rights**: The provisions also apply to consideration for real rights created by the obligor on the subject matter.
4. **Scope of Attachment**: The lien can be attached to future proceeds or considerations that the obligor is to receive, indicating a proactive measure to secure the interest.
5. **Timing of Attachment**: The attachment must occur before the obligor receives the monies or other things, emphasizing the importance of timely action.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given this factoring and without a specific query to evaluate against Article 304, it's essential to consider how these factors interact with potential queries. For instance, if a query asks whether a statutory lien can be applied to future payments an obligor is expected to receive due to the sale of the subject matter, the answer would logically follow from factors 1 and 4 (Y), as these directly address the application of statutory liens to such scenarios.

However, without a specific query provided in your request, I will demonstrate how to apply this reasoning with a hypothetical query: "Can a statutory lien be exercised against monies an obligor is to receive from selling the subject matter after those monies have been paid?"

Applying the factors:
- Factor 1 supports that a statutory lien can indeed be exercised against such monies.
- However, Factor 2 introduces a condition that the attachment must happen before payment or delivery, which would not be met in this hypothetical scenario.

Therefore, based on these considerations and specifically factor 2 (Condition for Exercising the Lien), the query would not logically follow from the article because it violates the timing requirement for attaching the lien. Thus, for this specific hypothetical query: N.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors of Article 304:

1. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: In this scenario, a statutory lien is exercised against monies related to the sale of the subject matter (Factor 1), but the attachment occurs after the payment or delivery of these monies (contrary to Factor 2). Since the condition for exercising the lien (attachment before payment or delivery) is not met, the juridical act is invalid.

2. (3 | Y) 
Justification: This case involves the creation of real rights by the obligor on the subject matter of the statutory lien (Factor 3), which the article explicitly states is within its provisions. Therefore, without any conditions being violated, the juridical act related to these real rights is legally valid.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Here, a statutory lien can be exercised against future proceeds from the sale of the subject matter (Factor 1), and it applies to future considerations the obligor is to receive (Factor 4). Since both factors support the application of the statutory lien without violating any conditions, the juridical act is legally valid.

4. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: In this case, the holder must attach the monies or other things before their payment or delivery (Factor 2), but the attachment occurs after the obligor receives the monies (contrary to Factor 5's emphasis on timely action). The failure to meet the timing requirement for attachment makes the juridical act invalid.

5. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario involves exercising a statutory lien against things related to the sale of the subject matter (Factor 1) and applies to consideration for real rights created by the obligor (Factor 3). Both factors are directly supported by the article without any conditions being violated, making the juridical act legally valid.

6. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The statutory lien can be attached to future proceeds or considerations (Factor 4), and the attachment must occur before the obligor receives these monies (Factor 5). Since both factors are met without violating any conditions, the juridical act is legally valid.

7. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although this scenario involves the condition for exercising the lien (Factor 2) and applies to real rights created by the obligor (Factor 3), if the attachment does not happen before payment or delivery as required, the juridical act is invalid.

8. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Exercising a statutory lien against monies related to the sale of the subject matter (Factor 1) and doing so in a timely manner before receipt by the obligor (Factor 5) means that both critical aspects are met without violating any conditions, making the juridical act legally valid.

9. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This case involves consideration for real rights created by the obligor on the subject matter (Factor 3) and applies to future considerations the obligor is to receive (Factor 4). Since both factors are directly supported by the article without any violations of conditions, the juridical act related to these aspects is legally valid.

10. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the statutory lien can be exercised against future proceeds (Factor 4), if the condition that the attachment must happen before payment or delivery (Factor 2) is not met, then the juridical act is invalid due to this violation of timing requirements.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and their implications for the legal validity of the juridical acts in question.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks based on the provided article and query:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "An obligee that has a general statutory lien may exercise the statutory lien concerning money that the obligor has received in payment as compensation for that Thing owned."

We assess whether this query entails each of the factors listed:

1. **Statutory Lien Definition**: The query directly mentions exercising a statutory lien on money received by the obligor, which aligns with the definition provided in factor 1. Therefore, (Query entails 1).
2. **Condition for Exercising the Lien**: The query does not explicitly mention that the attachment of the lien occurred before the payment or delivery of the monies. In fact, it implies the money has already been received by the obligor, which contradicts factor 2. Therefore, (Query not entails 2).
3. **Application to Real Rights**: The query does not specifically discuss real rights created by the obligor on the subject matter of the lien. Thus, (Query not entails 3).
4. **Scope of Attachment**: The query implies that the statutory lien is being exercised on money received as compensation for the thing owned, which falls under the scope of future proceeds or considerations. Therefore, (Query entails 4).
5. **Timing of Attachment**: As mentioned earlier, the query suggests the money has already been received by the obligor, implying the attachment would need to have occurred before this payment was made to be valid. However, since it doesn't explicitly state that the attachment happened before the payment, and given the implication that the obligee is exercising the lien after receipt, (Query not entails 5).

### Task 2:
The query asks about the validity of an obligee exercising a statutory lien on money the obligor has received as compensation. The article specifies that for a statutory lien to be exercised against monies or other things, it must be attached before their payment or delivery. Since the query implies the money has already been paid (received by the obligor), this condition is not met according to the information given in the query itself. Therefore, based on the timing requirement specified in the article, the juridical act described in the query would be considered legally invalid because it does not comply with the prerequisite that the lien must be attached before the payment or delivery of the monies. Hence, (Query Invalid).

 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we need to analyze and factor the content of Article 343 and then assess how the query aligns with these factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Subject Matter**: The subject matter is about what can or cannot be made the subject of a pledge.
2. **Condition for Pledge**: A thing must be transferable to another person to be pledged.
3. **Restriction on Non-Transferable Items**: Things that cannot be transferred to another person are restricted from being made the subject of a pledge.
4. **Definition of Transferability**: The article implies that transferability is a prerequisite for an item to be considered for pledging, suggesting that non-transferable items do not meet this criterion.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given the query "A thing that cannot be transferred to another person may not be made the subject of a pledge," it directly aligns with the conditions and restrictions stated in Article 343. The article explicitly states that for something to be pledged, it must be transferable. If an item is not transferable, according to the article, it cannot be the subject of a pledge.

Since the query directly reflects the content and intention of Article 343 without introducing any contradictory or unrelated elements, it logically follows from the legal context provided.

Therefore, the response to whether the query is legally valid with the context of the article is: **Y**.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 343 and its factors, I will generate 10 case scenarios as instructed.


1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The subject matter is about what can be pledged, and the condition for pledge is met because the item is transferable, making it legally valid to pledge.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: Only the restriction on non-transferable items is considered, implying the item cannot be transferred and thus cannot be pledged, rendering the act invalid.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The subject matter of pledging is involved, and the definition of transferability is met, indicating the item can be transferred and thus can be legally pledged.

4. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although there's a condition for pledge (transferability), the restriction on non-transferable items applies, indicating the item cannot be pledged because it's not transferable, making the act invalid.

5. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Despite covering the subject matter and condition for pledge, the presence of a restriction on non-transferable items takes precedence if the item is not transferable, thus the act is invalid.

6. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The definition of transferability is met, implying the item can be transferred to another person, which is sufficient for it to be pledged, making the act legally valid.

7. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: While the subject matter of pledging is relevant, the restriction on non-transferable items indicates the item in question cannot be transferred and thus cannot be pledged, rendering the act invalid.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Both the condition for pledge (transferability) and the definition of transferability are satisfied, indicating the item can indeed be pledged because it is transferable, making the act valid.

9. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: All factors regarding the subject matter, condition for pledge, and definition of transferability are met, clearly indicating the item's eligibility to be pledged since it is transferable, thus the act is legally valid.

10. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the definition of transferability suggests an item can be transferred, the restriction on non-transferable items implies a specific scenario where despite understanding what makes something transferable, the item in question cannot be transferred, thus it cannot be pledged, making the act invalid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 343 and provides a clear verdict based on whether the conditions for pledging are met.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 1
The query "Pledges cannot be created over a Thing that cannot be assigned to others" directly relates to the subject matter of what can or cannot be made the subject of a pledge, which aligns with Factor 1.

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 2
The query implies that for a thing to be pledged, it must be assignable (or transferable) to others, which directly relates to the condition for pledge as stated in Factor 2.

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 3
The query explicitly states that pledges cannot be created over things that cannot be assigned to others, which aligns with the restriction on non-transferable items as mentioned in Factor 3.

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 4
The query's implication about transferability being a prerequisite for pledging indirectly touches upon the definition of transferability as it relates to pledging, covered by Factor 4.

## Step 5: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query directly reflects the conditions and restrictions stated in Article 343 regarding what can be pledged, without introducing any contradictory elements, it logically follows from the legal context provided. Therefore, the query is expressing a legally valid principle based on the article's content.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1), (Query entails 2), (Query entails 3), (Query entails 4), (Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the given articles, we must first break down the information provided into key factors and then analyze these factors against the query to assess validity.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Creation of Pledge**: The creation of a pledge becomes effective through the delivery of the subject matter of the pledge to the obligee (Article 344).
2. **Pledge Possession**: A pledgee may not allow a pledgor to possess the thing pledged on behalf of the pledgee (Article 345).
3. **Effectiveness Condition**: The effectiveness of a pledge is conditional upon the physical transfer or delivery of the pledged item.
4. **Possession Restriction**: There's a restriction on the possession arrangement between the pledgee and the pledgor after the pledge is created.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we can now assess any query against the context provided by Articles 344 and 345 to determine its legal validity. However, since no specific query is provided for evaluation, let's create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes:

Query: "Can a pledgee allow the original owner of an item to continue possessing it after a pledge has been created?"

To evaluate this query:
- **Factor 1 (Creation of Pledge)** indicates that delivery is necessary for a pledge to be effective.
- **Factor 2 (Pledge Possession)** directly states that a pledgor cannot possess the thing pledged on behalf of the pledgee, implying that once a pledge is created, the pledgee should maintain control or possession.
- **Factor 3 (Effectiveness Condition)** and **Factor 4 (Possession Restriction)** support the notion that physical delivery and specific possession arrangements are crucial.

Given these factors, allowing the original owner (pledgor) to continue possessing the item after a pledge has been created contradicts Article 345. Thus, based on the provided articles and their factors, the answer to the hypothetical query would be "N" because it does not align with the legal context that restricts the pledgor's continued possession of the pledged item on behalf of the pledgee.

Please provide the actual query you'd like evaluated against these articles for a specific assessment.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors derived from Articles 344 and 345, we will consider all possible combinations of these factors that lead to a definitive conclusion regarding the legal validity of a pledge. The factors are:

1. **Creation of Pledge**: The creation of a pledge becomes effective through the delivery of the subject matter of the pledge to the obligee.
2. **Pledge Possession**: A pledgee may not allow a pledgor to possess the thing pledged on behalf of the pledgee.
3. **Effectiveness Condition**: The effectiveness of a pledge is conditional upon the physical transfer or delivery of the pledged item.
4. **Possession Restriction**: There's a restriction on the possession arrangement between the pledgee and the pledgor after the pledge is created.

Here are 10 case scenarios with their respective justifications:

1. (1, 2 | N)  
Justification: If both the creation of a pledge through delivery and the restriction on pledge possession occur, allowing the original owner to possess the item would contradict Article 345, making the pledge invalid.

2. (3 | Y)  
Justification: The effectiveness condition being met means the pledge was created through proper delivery, which aligns with Article 344, making the pledge legally valid.

3. (1, 4 | N)  
Justification: Even if the pledge is created and there's an understanding of possession restrictions, if these restrictions are violated (e.g., by allowing the pledgor to possess the item), it contradicts the principle that physical delivery must be accompanied by a transfer of possession control.

4. (2 | N)  
Justification: Simply having a rule against a pledgor possessing the pledged item on behalf of the pledgee does not automatically make a pledge valid without the actual creation and effectiveness conditions being met.

5. (1, 3 | Y)  
Justification: If the pledge is created through delivery and this meets the condition for its effectiveness, then the pledge is legally valid according to Article 344.

6. (4 | N)  
Justification: Knowing there's a restriction on possession does not inherently validate a pledge without considering how it was created or whether the effectiveness conditions were met.

7. (2, 3 | N)  
Justification: Even if the pledgee does not allow the pledgor to possess the item and the effectiveness condition is understood, without actual delivery (Factor 1), the pledge cannot be considered legally valid.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y)  
Justification: If all conditions are met—creation through delivery, adherence to possession restrictions, and fulfillment of the effectiveness condition—the pledge is legally valid.

9. (1, 4, 3 | Y)  
Justification: With the creation of a pledge, understanding of possession restrictions, and fulfillment of the effectiveness condition, the pledge would be considered legally valid as it adheres to the requirements outlined in Articles 344 and 345.

10. (2, 4 | N)  
Justification: Understanding that a pledgor cannot possess an item on behalf of the pledgee and knowing there are possession restrictions does not validate a pledge without the actual creation through delivery occurring.

Each scenario provides a unique combination of factors leading to a determination of whether a pledge is legally valid or invalid based on Articles 344 and 345.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 ### Begin Factoring
1. The article discusses the rights and limitations of a pledgor in relation to a pledgee.
2. A pledgor cannot allow a pledgee to acquire ownership of the pledged item as satisfaction for obligations through the acts establishing pledges or prior contracts.
3. The pledgor also cannot promise to let the pledgee dispose of the pledged item in any manner not prescribed by law.
4. The query needs to be evaluated against these rules to determine its validity.

Given Query: Not explicitly provided, but based on the instruction, we will assume a hypothetical query such as "Can a pledgor allow a pledgee to acquire ownership of the thing pledged as satisfaction of the obligations?"

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

To evaluate the query's validity:
- The article clearly states that a pledgor may not allow a pledgee to acquire ownership of the thing pledged as satisfaction of the obligations. 
- This directly addresses the hypothetical query, indicating that such an action is not permitted according to the article.

Given this analysis, if the query asks about allowing a pledgee to acquire ownership or dispose of the pledged item in unauthorized ways, it would logically follow that this is not allowed under the given legal context. However, without the explicit query provided in the problem statement, we must infer based on typical queries related to such legal articles.

If the query were "Can a pledgor allow a pledgee to acquire ownership of the thing pledged as satisfaction of the obligations?", the answer would be "N" because the article explicitly prohibits this action. 

However, since the exact query is not provided in your prompt, and based on the instruction to follow the format strictly but without a specific query to evaluate against Article 349 directly, I will provide an answer based on the assumption that any query directly violating the principles outlined in Article 349 would be considered invalid.

Thus, assuming a query that directly contradicts the article's provisions, the response would logically be "N" due to the explicit prohibitions stated in the article. 

But since we are to evaluate if a query "logically follows the legal context," and without the specific query provided, it seems there might have been an oversight in providing a direct question to assess against Article 349's content.

Given this, my response based on the hypothetical scenario provided and adhering strictly to the format requested would be "N" for any query that attempts to circumvent the article's stated limitations on the pledgor's actions regarding the pledgee's acquisition of ownership or disposal of the pledged item.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 349 and its factors, I will generate 10 case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | N)
Justification: The pledgor attempts to allow the pledgee to acquire ownership of the thing pledged as satisfaction of the obligations through the acts establishing pledges, which directly violates the article's provisions.

2. (3 | N)
Justification: The pledgor promises to let the pledgee dispose of the pledged item in a manner not prescribed by law, which is explicitly prohibited by the article.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The pledgor understands and respects the rights and limitations outlined in the article and does not attempt to circumvent them, ensuring that any actions taken are in accordance with the law.

4. (2, 3 | N)
Justification: Both the acts establishing pledges and a prior contract attempt to allow the pledgee to acquire ownership or dispose of the pledged item improperly, which clearly contravenes the article's stipulations.

5. (1, 2, 3 | N)
Justification: This scenario combines all violations—allowing acquisition of ownership through establishment acts, prior contracts, and promising unauthorized disposal methods—all of which are forbidden by the article.

6. (4 | Y)
Justification: The query is evaluated against the rules outlined in the article, and since no specific violation is attempted, the juridical act remains valid as it adheres to legal standards.

7. (1, 3 | N)
Justification: The pledgor attempts to both promise unauthorized disposal methods and potentially violate other rights and limitations, leading to an invalidation of the juridical act due to non-compliance with the article's requirements.

8. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: Although there's an attempt to allow acquisition through prior contracts, the understanding and evaluation against the article's rules ensure that any such attempt is recognized as invalid, thus preventing actual violation and maintaining the juridical act's validity.

9. (1, 2, 4 | N)
Justification: Despite recognizing the rights and limitations, attempting to circumvent them through the acts establishing pledges or prior contracts renders the juridical act invalid due to direct violations of the article.

10. (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: The pledgor promises not to let the pledgee dispose of the pledged item in unauthorized manners and evaluates queries against the article's rules, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and thus maintaining validity.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict based on Article 349.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Evaluate the query against Factor 1
The query discusses an agreement between a pledgee and a pledgor regarding the pledgee's acquisition of the thing pledged as performance for obligations. This directly relates to the rights and limitations of a pledgor in relation to a pledgee, which is the subject of Factor 1.

## Step 2: Determine if the query entails Factor 1
Given that the query touches on the relationship and agreements between a pledgee and a pledgor, it indeed entails Factor 1, as this factor broadly discusses the rights and limitations in such relationships.

## Step 3: Evaluate the query against Factor 2
Factor 2 states that a pledgor cannot allow a pledgee to acquire ownership of the pledged item as satisfaction for obligations through the acts establishing pledges or prior contracts. The query specifically mentions an agreement to the pledgee's acquisition of the thing pledged as performance for obligations, which aligns with the prohibition outlined in Factor 2.

## Step 4: Determine if the query entails Factor 2
The query directly pertains to allowing the pledgee to acquire ownership as satisfaction for obligations, which means it entails Factor 2.

## Step 5: Evaluate the query against Factor 3
Factor 3 indicates that the pledgor cannot promise to let the pledgee dispose of the pledged item in any manner not prescribed by law. While the query focuses on acquisition as performance for obligations, it implies an agreement that could be seen as disposing of the pledged item in a specific manner.

## Step 6: Determine if the query entails Factor 3
The query's focus is more on acquisition rather than disposal methods, but since it involves an agreement that might not be prescribed by law (given Article 349's context), it could be argued to entail Factor 3 indirectly.

## Step 7: Evaluate the query against Factor 4
Factor 4 mentions that the query needs to be evaluated against these rules to determine its validity. This factor is more about the process of evaluation rather than a specific aspect of the pledgor-pledgee relationship.

## Step 8: Determine if the query entails Factor 4
Since every query about the legal aspects of pledges must be evaluated against relevant laws and factors, the query inherently entails Factor 4 by virtue of being subject to legal evaluation.

## Step 9: Assess the validity of the query based on Article 349
Given that Article 349 explicitly prohibits a pledgor from allowing a pledgee to acquire ownership of the thing pledged as satisfaction for obligations, either through the acts establishing pledges or by contracts made prior to the due dates for the obligations, the query directly contradicts this provision.

## Step 10: Conclude on the validity of the query
The query explicitly determines that an agreement for the pledgee's acquisition of the thing pledged as performance for obligations is being considered. Since Article 349 prohibits such actions before the due dates and implies restrictions on how obligations can be satisfied, the query suggests a scenario that would be legally invalid according to the article.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given query, we first need to factor the provided article into its key components to understand its legal context and implications.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Ownership**: The land and a building on that land initially belong to the same owner.
2. **Mortgage Creation**: A mortgage is created with respect to either the land or the building, leading to a change in ownership due to enforcement.
3. **Superficies Creation**: Upon the enforcement of the mortgage, if the land and the building end up belonging to different owners, it is deemed that a superficies has been created regarding the building.
4. **Rent Determination**: In such cases, the rent for the superficies is fixed by the court at the request of the parties involved.
5. **Legal Implication**: The creation of a superficies implies certain legal rights and obligations between the owners of the land and the building.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given the query pair is missing, we'll consider a hypothetical query to demonstrate how one might assess its validity against the article:

**Hypothetical Query**: If a mortgage on a building leads to different ownership of the land and the building, can the court determine the rent for the superficies without a request from the parties?

To evaluate this query's validity:
- **Ownership (Factor 1)** is crucial as it sets the premise.
- **Mortgage Creation (Factor 2)** and its enforcement lead to different ownerships, which directly relates to the query.
- **Superficies Creation (Factor 3)** is implied in the scenario described by the query.
- **Rent Determination (Factor 4)** is where the query diverges from the article. The article explicitly states that rent is fixed "at the request of the parties," implying an action required by the involved parties for the court to intervene.

Given this analysis, if we were to answer based on a typical query about whether the court can determine rent without party request (which seems to be against the explicit wording of the article), the response would be **N**. The reason is that the article specifies the court's action in fixing the rent is contingent upon the request of the parties, suggesting an absence of this factor (party request) would invalidate the typical process described.

However, since the exact query to validate against the provided article is not given, the above analysis serves as a methodological approach to how one might evaluate queries against legal articles by factoring and reasoning through each component.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the article, I will generate 10 case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: The land and building belong to the same owner, and a mortgage is created, but without the enforcement of the mortgage leading to different ownership, it does not meet the conditions for superficies creation.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A superficies has been deemed created with respect to the building, and the rent can be fixed by the court at the request of the parties, indicating a valid legal process.

3. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the land and building initially belong to the same owner, and a superficies is deemed created, without the mortgage creation and its enforcement, it does not align with the article's conditions for superficies creation due to different ownership.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The creation of a mortgage and its implications on legal rights and obligations between land and building owners suggest that if the mortgage leads to different ownerships, it could result in a valid superficies scenario, aligning with the article's intent.

5. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Initial same ownership of land and building, coupled with rent determination by the court, does not inherently validate a superficies creation without the critical factors of mortgage creation and its enforcement leading to different ownerships.

6. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: A mortgage created on either the land or the building, which upon enforcement leads to them belonging to different owners, directly implies the conditions under which a superficies can be deemed created, making it legally valid.

7. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: Rent determination by the court and legal implications without the foundational factors of same initial ownership, mortgage creation, or the change in ownership due to enforcement do not constitute a complete scenario for validating a superficies under the article.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes all critical elements - same initial ownership, mortgage creation leading to different ownerships upon enforcement, and the implication of superficies creation. It aligns perfectly with the conditions outlined in the article for a valid superficies scenario.

9. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The deemed creation of a superficies and its legal implications directly result from the scenarios described in the article, indicating that if these conditions are met, the obligations and rights stemming from them would be legally valid.

10. (1, 2, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario includes all necessary factors - initial same ownership, mortgage creation, enforcement leading to different owners (implying superficies creation), and the legal process of rent determination by the court upon request. It represents a complete and valid application of the article's provisions.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from the article, ensuring no duplication and providing a clear verdict based on the presence or absence of critical conditions for superficies creation and its legal validity.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the query and the list of factors from the article, we assess whether each factor is entailed by the query.

1. **Ownership**: The query mentions a building owned by person A and land also owned by person A, so (Query entails 1).
2. **Mortgage Creation**: The query talks about a mortgage created as a joint mortgage for person B with respect to the building and the land, so (Query entails 2).
3. **Superficies Creation**: The query states that after the execution of the mortgage with respect to the land only, person C became the land owner, leading to statutory superficies with respect to the building on the land, so (Query entails 3).
4. **Rent Determination**: The query does not mention anything about rent determination or fixing by the court, so (Query not entails 4).
5. **Legal Implication**: The query implies certain legal rights and obligations between the owners of the land and the building due to the creation of a superficies, so (Query entails 5).

### Task 2:
The query explicitly states that statutory superficies with respect to the building on the land will be established after the execution of the mortgage, which aligns with the legal scenario described in Article 388. Therefore, the query does not question the validity of the juridical acts but rather describes a scenario where a superficies is legally established due to the change in ownership resulting from the mortgage enforcement.

Given this understanding, (Query Valid).

 To evaluate the query's validity with respect to Article 447, let's first break down the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Guarantee Obligation Scope**: The guarantee obligation includes not just the principal amount but also interest, penalty, and compensation for loss or damage related to the principal obligation.
2. **Inclusion of Secondary Charges**: All other charges that are secondary to the principal obligation are also part of the guarantee obligation.
3. **Guarantor's Stipulation Right**: A guarantor has the right to stipulate the amount of penalty or compensation for loss or damage, but this stipulation is limited to the guarantor's own guarantee obligation.
4. **Limitation on Guarantor's Stipulation**: The guarantor can only make stipulations regarding their own obligations and not those of others.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we need a query to assess its validity against Article 447. Since no specific query is provided for evaluation against Article 447 in your request, I'll demonstrate how one might approach this with a hypothetical query:

**Hypothetical Query**: A guarantor can stipulate the penalty amount for both their guarantee obligation and that of another party involved in the contract.

To determine if this query is legally valid based on Article 447:
- **Factor Presence/Absence**: The article clearly states that a guarantor may stipulate the amount of penalty or compensation for loss or damage "with regard to the guarantor's own guarantee obligation only" (Factor 3). This indicates a limitation on the scope of what a guarantor can stipulate.
- **Logical Consistency**: The hypothetical query contradicts Factor 3 by suggesting that a guarantor can stipulate penalties not just for their own obligations but also for those of another party. This goes beyond the rights granted to a guarantor as outlined in Article 447.

Given this analysis, if we were evaluating the hypothetical query "A guarantor can stipulate the penalty amount for both their guarantee obligation and that of another party involved in the contract," the response would be **N** because it contradicts the explicit limitation stated in Article 447 regarding a guarantor's right to stipulate penalties.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors of Article 447, we will systematically combine these factors in different ways to assess their impact on the validity of a juridical act or obligation. The factors are:

1. **Guarantee Obligation Scope**
2. **Inclusion of Secondary Charges**
3. **Guarantor's Stipulation Right**
4. **Limitation on Guarantor's Stipulation**

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | Y) - This scenario involves a guarantee obligation that includes interest, penalty, and compensation for loss or damage, as well as all other secondary charges. Given that these elements fall within the scope of what Article 447 defines as part of the guarantee obligation, this scenario is legally valid.

2. (3 | N) - In this case, only the guarantor's right to stipulate the amount of penalty or compensation for loss or damage is considered. However, without considering the limitation on this stipulation (Factor 4), and assuming an attempt to stipulate beyond their own guarantee obligation, this scenario would be invalid.

3. (1, 3 | Y) - Here, the guarantee obligation includes principal amounts plus interest, penalties, etc., and the guarantor exercises their right to stipulate penalties or compensation for loss or damage regarding their own obligation. This aligns with Article 447, making it valid.

4. (2, 4 | Y) - This scenario involves secondary charges being part of the guarantee obligation, and there's an understanding of the limitation on a guarantor's stipulation rights. Since both factors are in line with Article 447's provisions, this is considered valid.

5. (1, 4 | Y) - The guarantee obligation scope includes all necessary components, and there's an acknowledgment of the limitation on what a guarantor can stipulate. This scenario respects the boundaries set by Article 447, making it valid.

6. (2, 3 | N) - In this case, secondary charges are included, and the guarantor attempts to stipulate penalties or compensation. However, if this stipulation exceeds the guarantor's own obligations without respecting the limitations, it would be considered invalid.

7. (4 | Y) - The limitation on a guarantor's stipulation right is recognized. Since this factor alone does not violate any provision of Article 447 and rather reinforces one of its key points, this scenario is valid.

8. (1, 2, 3 | N) - This scenario includes the full scope of guarantee obligations, secondary charges, and the guarantor's stipulation right. However, if the stipulation attempt goes beyond the guarantor's own obligation, violating Factor 4 implicitly, it would be invalid.

9. (1, 2, 4 | Y) - Here, all aspects of the guarantee obligation are considered, including secondary charges, and there's a clear understanding of the limitations on guarantor stipulations. This comprehensive alignment with Article 447 makes the scenario valid.

10. (3, 4 | Y) - The guarantor's right to stipulate is exercised within the bounds of their own obligations, respecting the limitation on such stipulations. Since this directly aligns with Article 447's provisions regarding guarantor rights and limitations, this scenario is valid.

Each case has been designed to uniquely combine factors from Article 447, ensuring a clear verdict based on the article's stipulations.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement given the context of Article 453, let's first factor the article into its key components and then evaluate the query against these factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Obligee's Demand**: The obligee has made a demand to the principal obligor according to the preceding Article.
2. **Guarantor's Role**: The guarantor is involved in the scenario, potentially affecting the order of execution.
3. **Principal Obligor's Financial Resources**: The principal obligor must have the financial resources to pay the obligation for certain conditions to apply.
4. **Ease of Execution**: The execution on the principal obligor's property can be easily performed, which influences the decision on how to proceed.
5. **Priority of Execution**: The obligee must first execute on the property of the principal obligor under specific circumstances.

### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 5

Given these factors, we can now consider a query to determine if it logically follows from Article 453. However, since a specific query is not provided in your request, I will create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes:

Query: If the guarantor proves that the principal obligor has sufficient financial resources and execution on their property can be easily performed, must the obligee first attempt to execute on the principal obligor's assets?

To evaluate this query against Article 453:
- The article explicitly states that if the guarantor proves the principal obligor has the financial resources to pay the obligation and execution can be easily performed, the obligee **must first** execute on the property of the principal obligor. 
- This aligns with factors 3, 4, and 5 from our factoring (Principal Obligor's Financial Resources, Ease of Execution, and Priority of Execution).

Therefore, given the context provided by Article 453, the query is logically valid because it directly reflects the conditions and actions stipulated in the article.

Response: Y

Explanation: The query directly aligns with the factors outlined from Article 453, particularly those concerning the principal obligor's financial capability, the ease of executing on their property, and the priority given to executing on the principal obligor's assets under these circumstances.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors outlined from Article 453, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a specific combination of factors and provides a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. **(1, 3 | Y)**: The obligee has made a demand to the principal obligor, and the principal obligor has the financial resources to pay the obligation. In this scenario, since the guarantor's role and ease of execution are not considered, but the obligee has taken the initial step by making a demand and the principal obligor is capable of paying, the juridical act can be considered legally valid as it aligns with basic principles of debt collection.

2. **(2, 4 | N)**: The guarantor is involved, and execution on the principal obligor's property can be easily performed. However, without the obligee making a demand or considering the principal obligor's financial resources, this scenario does not meet all conditions required by Article 453 for determining the order of execution, thus it's invalid.

3. **(1, 2 | N)**: The obligee has made a demand to the principal obligor, and the guarantor is involved. Without information on the principal obligor's financial resources or the ease of execution, we cannot conclusively determine the validity based on Article 453 alone, as critical factors for prioritizing execution are missing.

4. **(3, 5 | Y)**: The principal obligor has the financial resources to pay the obligation, and the obligee must first execute on the property of the principal obligor. This scenario directly aligns with Article 453's stipulations regarding priority of execution based on the principal obligor's ability to pay, making it legally valid.

5. **(4 | N)**: Execution on the principal obligor's property can be easily performed. With only this factor considered and no mention of the obligee's demand, the guarantor's role, or the principal obligor's financial capacity, this scenario lacks critical elements to be deemed valid under Article 453.

6. **(1, 3, 4 | Y)**: The obligee has made a demand, the principal obligor has financial resources, and execution can be easily performed. Although the guarantor's role is not mentioned, these factors collectively suggest that conditions for prioritizing execution on the principal obligor's assets are met, supporting legal validity.

7. **(2, 3 | N)**: The guarantor is involved, and the principal obligor has financial resources. Without evidence of a demand by the obligee or consideration of the ease of execution, this scenario does not fulfill all necessary conditions outlined in Article 453 for determining the order of execution.

8. **(1, 4, 5 | Y)**: The obligee has made a demand, execution can be easily performed, and the obligee must first execute on the principal obligor's property. This combination aligns closely with Article 453's stipulations regarding the priority of execution, making it legally valid despite not explicitly mentioning the principal obligor's financial resources.

9. **(2, 5 | N)**: The guarantor is involved, and the obligee must first execute on the principal obligor's property. Without information on the obligee's demand or the principal obligor's financial situation and ease of execution, this scenario lacks necessary details to be considered valid under Article 453.

10. **(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)**: All factors are present - the obligee has made a demand, the guarantor is involved, the principal obligor has financial resources, execution can be easily performed, and the obligee must first execute on the principal obligor's property. This scenario fully aligns with Article 453's conditions for determining the order of execution, clearly supporting its legal validity.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors to evaluate the legal validity based on Article 453, ensuring no two cases use the same combination and yielding a determinate verdict in each instance.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks given:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "In order for a guarantor to exercise the right of defense of obligor's solvency, he/she must prove that the principal obligor has the financial resources to pay his/her obligation and that the execution would be easily performed."

Let's evaluate this against each factor from Article 453:

1. **Obligee's Demand**: The query does not directly mention the obligee making a demand according to the preceding Article, so it doesn't explicitly entail this factor.
2. **Guarantor's Role**: The query mentions the guarantor exercising a right, which implies their role is significant.
3. **Principal Obligor's Financial Resources**: The query specifically mentions proving the principal obligor has financial resources.
4. **Ease of Execution**: It also mentions that execution would be easily performed.
5. **Priority of Execution**: While it discusses conditions for the guarantor's action, it doesn't explicitly state the priority of execution on assets.

Thus:
- (Query entails 2)
- (Query entails 3)
- (Query entails 4)
But does not directly entail factors 1 and 5 in the context provided by the query itself.

### Task 2:
The query essentially outlines a condition under which a guarantor can exercise a certain right, implying that if these conditions are met, the guarantor's actions or defenses could be considered valid within the legal framework provided by Article 453. It does not question the legality of the obligations themselves but rather provides a scenario for their enforcement.

Therefore: 
**(Query Valid)**

This assessment is based on the query aligning with logical and legal principles outlined in Article 453, specifically concerning the guarantor's ability to invoke certain defenses under specified conditions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the given article, let's analyze the provided legal article and then apply the same method to the example queries.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Postponement and Renewal Effectiveness**: The postponement of expiry and renewal of prescription periods due to certain grounds (like a request for performance) are effective against both the principal obligor and the guarantor.
2. **Guarantor's Defense Rights**: A guarantor has the right to assert defenses that the principal obligor could raise against the obligee.
3. **Principal Obligor's Rights Impact on Guarantor**: If the principal obligor has rights such as set-off, rescission, or cancellation against the obligee, the guarantor can refuse performance to the extent these rights should release the principal obligor from obligation.
4. **General Principle of Accessory Liability**: The liability of a guarantor is accessory to that of the principal obligor, meaning the guarantor's obligations are generally aligned with and dependent on the principal obligor's situation.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we can analyze example queries to determine their validity in the context of the article:

1. **Example Query**: "If a principal obligor has a right to set-off against the obligee, can the guarantor assert this right as well?"
   - **Validity**: Y. This follows from Factor 3 (Principal Obligor's Rights Impact on Guarantor), which states that if the principal obligor has certain rights (like set-off) against the obligee, the guarantor may refuse to perform the obligation to the extent these rights should have released the principal obligor.

2. **Example Query**: "Can a guarantor assert defenses that are not available to the principal obligor?"
   - **Validity**: N. This does not logically follow from Factor 2 (Guarantor's Defense Rights), which specifies that a guarantor may only assert defenses that could be raised by the principal obligor.

3. **Example Query**: "Does the renewal of a prescription period due to a request for performance affect the guarantor?"
   - **Validity**: Y. This is supported by Factor 1 (Postponement and Renewal Effectiveness), indicating that such actions are effective against both the principal obligor and the guarantor.

These analyses demonstrate how each query's validity can be determined based on the factors extracted from the article, considering whether the query aligns with or contradicts these established principles.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 457, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The postponement of expiry and renewal of prescription periods due to certain grounds affects both the principal obligor and the guarantor, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (2 | Y) 
Justification: A guarantor has the right to assert defenses that the principal obligor could raise against the obligee, thus the guarantor's action is legally valid.

3. (3 | Y) 
Justification: If the principal obligor has rights such as set-off, rescission, or cancellation against the obligee, the guarantor can refuse performance to the extent these rights should release the principal obligor from obligation, making the act valid.

4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Both the postponement of expiry and renewal of prescription periods affecting the guarantor and the guarantor's right to assert defenses available to the principal obligor are recognized, making the act legally valid.

5. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of the guarantor's defense rights and their ability to refuse performance based on the principal obligor's set-off, rescission, or cancellation rights against the obligee supports the legality of the act.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The effectiveness of postponement and renewal of prescription periods for both parties, along with the guarantor's option to refuse performance based on the principal obligor's rights, validates the juridical act.

7. (4 | N) 
Justification: The general principle of accessory liability alone does not inherently validate a specific juridical act without considering the other factors directly related to the act's legality in the context provided.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: When all factors related to the postponement and renewal of prescription periods, guarantor's defense rights, and the impact of principal obligor's rights on the guarantor are present, the act is legally valid due to comprehensive coverage of the article's stipulations.

9. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Although factor 4 (General Principle of Accessory Liability) alone might not validate an act, when combined with the guarantor's right to assert defenses (factor 2), it supports the legality of the juridical act in a context where accessory liability principles are relevant.

10. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of the effectiveness of postponement and renewal of prescription periods for both parties and the general principle of accessory liability provides a basis for validating the juridical act, as it aligns with both specific and general legal principles outlined in the article.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors to determine the legality of the juridical act based on Article 457.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement based on Article 459, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then assess whether the query logically follows from these factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Guarantor's Obligation**: A guarantor gives a guarantee at the request of the principal obligor.
2. **Performance of Obligation**: The guarantor performs the obligation on behalf of the principal obligor or takes an action that leads to the extinguishment of the obligation using their own property.
3. **Right to Reimbursement**: The guarantor has a right to reimbursement from the principal obligor for the amount of property expended in performing the obligation or taking the action for extinguishment.
4. **Limitation on Reimbursement**: The reimbursement is limited to the amount of the principal obligation extinguished, even if the guarantor's expenditure exceeds this amount.
5. **Application of Article 442, Paragraph (2)**: The provisions of Article 442, paragraph (2), apply mutatis mutandis to cases involving a guarantor's performance or actions for obligation extinguishment.
6. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**: This implies that certain principles or rules from Article 442 are adapted and applied to the scenarios described in Article 459, though the specifics of these adaptations are not detailed within Article 459 itself.

### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 6

Given this factoring and without a specific query provided to assess against Article 459, we cannot directly determine the validity of a query. However, the process involves comparing the elements of the query against these factored components to see if the query's assertions or questions align with the conditions, rights, and limitations outlined in Article 459.

To provide an answer (Y/N) as requested, I would need the specific query related to Article 459. Since no query is provided for validation against the article's context, I'll illustrate a hypothetical approach:

- **Hypothetical Query**: "A guarantor who performs an obligation on behalf of the principal obligor has an unconditional right to full reimbursement from the principal obligor regardless of the amount expended."
  
  Based on the factors:
  - This query would be invalid (N) because it contradicts Factor 4, which limits the reimbursement to the amount of the principal obligation extinguished.

Please provide a specific query for a detailed analysis and answer.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 459, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of these factors. For each scenario, I will determine whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N) according to the article.

1. **Case Scenario 1**: (1, 2 | Y)
   - Justification: This case involves a guarantor giving a guarantee at the request of the principal obligor and performing the obligation on behalf of the principal obligor. Since both factors are directly related to the conditions under which a guarantor acts, the act is legally valid.

2. **Case Scenario 2**: (3, 5 | Y)
   - Justification: Here, the guarantor has a right to reimbursement and the provisions of Article 442, paragraph (2), apply mutatis mutandis. This combination directly addresses the rights and procedural aspects of guarantee obligations, making the act legally valid.

3. **Case Scenario 3**: (4 | N)
   - Justification: If only the limitation on reimbursement is considered without any context of performance or agreement, it does not inherently validate or invalidate an action. However, since this factor alone doesn't establish a complete scenario for legal validity regarding the act's performance, we must consider the absence of other critical factors as leading to ambiguity and thus potentially invalid (N) in isolation.

4. **Case Scenario 4**: (1, 3 | Y)
   - Justification: The guarantor gives a guarantee at the request of the principal obligor and has a right to reimbursement. These two factors establish both the basis for the guarantee and the consequence of its execution, making the act legally valid.

5. **Case Scenario 5**: (2, 6 | Y)
   - Justification: The guarantor performs the obligation or takes an action for extinguishment, and the principles from Article 442 apply mutatis mutandis. This scenario covers both the performance of obligations and the application of relevant legal principles, indicating legal validity.

6. **Case Scenario 6**: (1, 4, 5 | Y)
   - Justification: Combining the guarantor's obligation at the request of the principal obligor, the limitation on reimbursement, and the application of Article 442 provisions, this scenario covers essential aspects of guarantee obligations, including rights, limitations, and procedural applications. Thus, it is legally valid.

7. **Case Scenario 7**: (2, 3 | Y)
   - Justification: The guarantor performs the obligation or takes an action for extinguishment and has a right to reimbursement. This directly relates to the core actions and consequences of guarantee obligations, making the act legally valid.

8. **Case Scenario 8**: (1, 6 | Y)
   - Justification: The guarantor gives a guarantee at the request of the principal obligor, and principles from Article 442 apply mutatis mutandis. Although this combination lacks direct reference to performance or reimbursement, it establishes the basis for legal actions under guarantees and applies relevant legal principles, indicating legal validity.

9. **Case Scenario 9**: (3, 4 | Y)
   - Justification: The guarantor has a right to reimbursement, which is limited to the amount of the principal obligation extinguished. This scenario focuses on the consequences of guarantee obligations and sets boundaries for reimbursement, making it legally valid as it directly addresses how guarantees are resolved.

10. **Case Scenario 10**: (5, 6 | Y)
    - Justification: The provisions of Article 442 apply mutatis mutandis, and this application is considered in the context of a guarantor's actions under Article 459. This scenario emphasizes the procedural and legal framework within which guarantee obligations are executed, supporting its legal validity.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 459 and assesses the legal validity based on these specific conditions, ensuring that no two cases use the same combination of factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query, we first need to factor the given article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query's validity within the context provided.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Assignment of Claims**: The article discusses the assignment of claims, including those that are yet to arise.
2. **Notice Requirement**: For an assignment to be duly asserted against the obligor or a third party, notice must be given to the obligor.
3. **Consent Alternative**: Instead of notice, consent from the obligor can also validate the assignment.
4. **Instrument with Certified Date for Third Parties**: When dealing with third parties other than the obligor, notice or consent must be in an instrument bearing a certified date to be duly asserted.
5. **Applicability Against Obligors and Third Parties**: The distinction between obligations towards the obligor and other third parties is crucial.

### End of Factoring

Given these factors, we need to assess if the query logically follows from them. However, since the specific query isn't provided in your prompt, let's create a hypothetical query based on common legal questions related to assignment of claims:

**Hypothetical Query**: "Can an assignee assert their rights against a third party without providing notice or obtaining consent from the obligor if they have documentation of the assignment?"

To answer this query based on the factored components:
- The article clearly states that notice or consent is required for the assignment to be duly asserted against the obligor or any other third party (Factors 2 and 3).
- Furthermore, when dealing with third parties, the requirement for an instrument with a certified date adds an additional layer of formality (Factor 4).

Given these considerations, if we were to determine the validity of the hypothetical query based on the provided article:
- The query suggests a scenario where notice or consent might not be necessary under certain conditions, which contradicts the explicit requirements outlined in the article.

Therefore, without a specific query but using this hypothetical example, the answer would logically lean towards **N**, because the article emphasizes the necessity of notice or consent for assignments to be duly asserted against obligors and third parties, with additional formalities required for third parties beyond the obligor. 

**Number of factors : 5**

Please provide the actual query for a precise analysis within the context of Article 467.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors described from Article 467, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The assignment of a claim is made, and notice is given to the obligor. Since notice is a valid method for asserting the assignment against the obligor, this scenario meets the requirements outlined in Article 467.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: Only consent from the obligor is obtained without any notice or documentation of the assignment being provided to the obligor or any third party. Given that consent alone might not be sufficient for all scenarios, especially lacking formal documentation or notification, this does not guarantee legal validity against all parties.

3. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: An assignment is made and documented with a certified date for a third party, but no notice is given to the obligor, nor is consent obtained. The lack of notice or consent from the obligor makes this assignment invalid against the obligor and potentially against other third parties.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Notice is given to the obligor, and the obligor has also consented to the assignment. This scenario clearly meets the requirements for validity as it combines both notice and consent.

5. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The assignment of a claim is made, notice is given to the obligor, and the obligor has consented to the assignment. This comprehensive approach ensures that all bases are covered regarding notice and consent, making the assignment legally valid.

6. (4 | N) 
Justification: Only an instrument with a certified date is used for a third party without any mention of giving notice to the obligor or obtaining consent. The article requires notice or consent specifically from the obligor, which this scenario lacks.

7. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: An assignment of a claim is made and is applicable against both the obligor and other third parties, but there's no mention of notice being given or consent being obtained. Without these critical elements, the assignment cannot be duly asserted.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Notice is given to the obligor, and an instrument with a certified date is used for notification or consent regarding third parties. This scenario covers both the requirement for notice to the obligor and the formal documentation needed for third parties.

9. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The obligor has consented to the assignment, and it's applicable against both the obligor and other third parties. However, without any formal notice or documentation with a certified date, especially considering the need for such formality in dealing with third parties, this scenario may not fully meet legal validity criteria.

10. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: An assignment is made, notice is given to the obligor, and an instrument with a certified date is used for documentation regarding third parties. This comprehensive approach covers all necessary elements for the assignment to be legally valid against both the obligor and other third parties.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 467, leading to a determinate verdict on the legal validity of the juridical act based on the occurrence of these factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To evaluate the query's validity, let's first break down the provided article into its constituent factors and then assess how these factors relate to the query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Definition of Obligor's Rights**: An obligor may assert against the assignee any event that has occurred with regard to the assignor by the time of completion of the perfection.
2. **Time of Completion of Perfection**: The timing of when the perfection is completed, which affects what can be asserted by the obligor.
3. **Specific Case Considerations**: Special considerations apply for cases referred to in Article 466, paragraph (4), and Article 466-3, adjusting the timing for what constitutes the completion of perfection.
4. **Article 466, Paragraph (4) Reference**: A mention of a reasonable period of time elapsing as an alternative marker for when events can be asserted against the assignee in specific cases.
5. **Article 466-3 Reference**: The receipt of a request from the assignee to make a deposit with an official depository is another condition affecting the timing of what can be asserted by the obligor.
6. **General Principle of Assertion**: The obligor's ability to assert events against the assignee hinges on when these events occurred relative to specific points in time (perfection, request for deposit, etc.).

### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 6

Given this factoring and without a specific query provided to assess its validity directly against the article, it's essential to note that any query evaluating the timing and conditions under which an obligor can assert events against an assignee, especially in relation to the completion of perfection or special case considerations (like those mentioned in Articles 466 and 466-3), would need to closely align with these factors.

To respond accurately to a query regarding its legal validity within this context, one must ensure that the query directly pertains to the rights and conditions outlined for obligors and assignees, particularly focusing on the timing of events (completion of perfection, elapse of reasonable time, receipt of deposit requests) as they relate to assertions made against assignees. 

Without a specific query to evaluate, any assessment would be speculative. However, if a query were to ask about the conditions under which an obligor can assert past events against an assignee in relation to the timing outlined in the article (e.g., "Can an obligor assert an event that occurred before completion of perfection against the assignee?"), one could evaluate its validity by checking if it aligns with factors 1 through 6, particularly focusing on how the query addresses or ignores the critical timing and case-specific considerations mentioned. 

If a query were provided and directly addressed these points, I would assess whether it logically follows from the principles outlined in Article 468, considering the special conditions for certain cases as described. If it aligns well with these factors without contradicting them or introducing unrelated concepts, the response would be "Y". Conversely, if the query contradicts, misinterprets, or ignores these key points, the response would be "N".
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 468, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of these factors. For each scenario, I'll determine whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N) according to the article and the occurrence of these factors.

1. **Case Scenario:** The obligor asserts an event that occurred before the completion of perfection against the assignee without considering special case conditions.
   - Factors: 1, 2
   - Justification: Since the assertion is based on events prior to the completion of perfection (Factor 2) and directly relates to the obligor's rights (Factor 1), this scenario aligns with the general principle outlined in Article 468. Thus, it is **(1, 2 | Y)**.

2. **Case Scenario:** The obligor attempts to assert an event that occurred after receiving a request for deposit from the assignee as per Article 466-3.
   - Factors: 1, 5
   - Justification: This scenario involves the obligor's right to assert events (Factor 1) and the specific condition of receiving a deposit request (Factor 5), which is a valid basis for assertion under Article 468. Hence, **(1, 5 | Y)**.

3. **Case Scenario:** The completion of perfection has not been achieved, but the obligor asserts an event based on a reasonable period elapsing as per Article 466, paragraph (4).
   - Factors: 2, 4
   - Justification: Since the assertion is tied to the concept of a reasonable time elapsing (Factor 4) rather than the actual completion of perfection (which hasn't occurred), this scenario misaligns with the requirement for asserting events based on the timing of perfection. Thus, **(2, 4 | N)**.

4. **Case Scenario:** The obligor asserts an event that happened before a reasonable period elapsed as per Article 466, paragraph (4).
   - Factors: 3, 4
   - Justification: Given that special case considerations (Factor 3) are in play and the assertion is based on events occurring before a reasonable time has elapsed (Factor 4), this scenario does not align with the conditions under which assertions can be made. Hence, **(3, 4 | N)**.

5. **Case Scenario:** The obligor receives a request for deposit from the assignee as per Article 466-3 and asserts an event that occurred prior to this request.
   - Factors: 1, 3, 5
   - Justification: This scenario involves the obligor's general right to assert (Factor 1), special case considerations (Factor 3), and the specific condition of a deposit request (Factor 5). Since the event occurred before the request and thus before the point at which assertions can be considered valid under Article 466-3, it is **(1, 3, 5 | Y)**.

6. **Case Scenario:** The completion of perfection has been achieved, but no special case conditions apply.
   - Factors: 2
   - Justification: With the completion of perfection (Factor 2) and no special considerations, any event that occurred before this point can be asserted by the obligor against the assignee. Thus, **(2 | Y)**.

7. **Case Scenario:** The obligor asserts an event without considering whether a reasonable period has elapsed or if a deposit request was made.
   - Factors: 1
   - Justification: Since the scenario only involves the general principle of assertion (Factor 1) without regard to timing or special conditions, it lacks specificity required by Article 468 for determining validity. Hence, **(1 | N)**.

8. **Case Scenario:** The obligor attempts to assert an event that occurred after the completion of perfection based on special case considerations.
   - Factors: 2, 3
   - Justification: Given that the assertion is about events post-perfection (Factor 2) and involves special case considerations (Factor 3), this aligns with the article's provisions allowing for such assertions under specific conditions. Thus, **(2, 3 | Y)**.

9. **Case Scenario:** The obligor receives a deposit request from the assignee but asserts an event that occurred after this point.
   - Factors: 4, 5
   - Justification: This scenario misaligns with Article 468 because assertions based on events occurring after the receipt of a deposit request (Factors 4 and 5) are not considered valid under the conditions outlined. Hence, **(4, 5 | N)**.

10. **Case Scenario:** All factors are considered - the obligor asserts an event that occurred before completion of perfection, considering special case conditions and the timing of both a reasonable period elapsing and receiving a deposit request.
    - Factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    - Justification: This comprehensive scenario aligns with all provisions of Article 468 regarding the assertion of events by the obligor against the assignee. It respects timing (Factors 2 and 4), special considerations (Factor 3), the general right to assert (Factor 1), and specific conditions like deposit requests (Factor 5). Thus, **(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)**.

Each scenario provides a unique combination of factors from Article 468, allowing for a determinate verdict on the validity of the obligor's assertion against the assignee.

 To address the query regarding whether a performance made to an unauthorized person is effective, let's break down the provided legal articles into key factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Performance to Unauthorized Person**: The article discusses the scenario where performance is made to a person not authorized to accept it.
2. **Appearance of Authorization**: It mentions that the effectiveness of such performance depends on whether the unauthorized person appears to be authorized based on common sense in transactions.
3. **Good Faith and Lack of Negligence**: For the performance to be effective when made to an apparent authorized person, the performer must have acted in good faith and without negligence.
4. **Enrichment of Obligee**: In cases not covered by the first scenario (e.g., performance to a clearly unauthorized person), effectiveness is contingent upon whether the obligee is enriched as a result.
5. **Intent and Common Sense**: The articles imply that both the intent behind the performance and the application of common sense in transactions play crucial roles in determining validity.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we must assess whether the query about the effectiveness of a performance made to an unauthorized person logically follows from the provided legal context. The articles provide conditions under which such performances can be considered effective (good faith, lack of negligence, appearance of authorization, and enrichment of the obligee). Without a specific query to evaluate against these factors, it's challenging to definitively label the query as valid or invalid based solely on the information given.

However, considering the structure of your request for an evaluation based on logical consistency with the provided legal context, let's assume a hypothetical query that asks: "Is a performance made in good faith to someone who appears authorized effective?" Based on Article 478, this query would logically follow and be considered valid because it directly aligns with one of the conditions outlined (good faith and appearance of authorization).

Therefore, for such a query, the response would be **Y**, as it matches the criteria set forth in the articles regarding when a performance made to an unauthorized person can still be effective.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 478 and Article 479, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of these factors has occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this case, performance was made to an unauthorized person (Factor 1), but they appeared to be authorized based on common sense in transactions (Factor 2). According to Article 478, if the performer acted in good faith and without negligence (implied by the appearance of authorization), the performance is effective. Thus, the act is legally valid.

2. (3 | N)
Justification: Here, the performer acted in good faith and without negligence (Factor 3), but there's no mention of the performance being made to someone who appears authorized or the obligee being enriched. Without these crucial elements, the performance cannot be deemed effective solely based on good faith. Hence, the act is legally invalid.

3. (1, 4 | N)
Justification: This scenario involves a performance made to an unauthorized person (Factor 1), and the obligee was enriched as a result (Factor 4). However, Article 479 states that enrichment of the obligee alone makes the performance effective only "to the extent" of such enrichment. Without good faith or appearance of authorization, the performance's effectiveness is limited and conditional, making it generally invalid under these circumstances.

4. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the unauthorized person appeared to be authorized based on common sense in transactions (Factor 2), and both intent and common sense play a role (Factor 5). Given that appearance of authorization is a key factor for effectiveness under Article 478, and considering the importance of intent and common sense, it can be inferred that the performance would likely be deemed effective if made in good faith. Thus, the act is legally valid.

5. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: Performance was made to an unauthorized person (Factor 1), but it was done in good faith and without negligence (Factor 3). According to Article 478, these conditions are sufficient for the performance to be effective if the person appeared authorized. Although appearance of authorization isn't explicitly mentioned, the good faith and lack of negligence imply a scenario where effectiveness could be argued, especially under the assumption that appearance of authorization might have been present. Hence, the act can be considered legally valid.

6. (4 | N)
Justification: The obligee was enriched as a result of the performance (Factor 4), but there's no information about good faith, appearance of authorization, or intent. Article 479 suggests that enrichment alone does not automatically make a performance to an unauthorized person effective; it only determines the extent of effectiveness. Without additional factors like good faith or appearance of authorization, the act remains legally invalid.

7. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The unauthorized person appeared authorized based on common sense in transactions (Factor 2), and the performer acted in good faith and without negligence (Factor 3). Article 478 clearly states that under these conditions, the performance is effective. Thus, the act is legally valid.

8. (1, 5 | N)
Justification: Performance was made to an unauthorized person (Factor 1), and both intent and common sense play a role (Factor 5). Without good faith, lack of negligence, or appearance of authorization explicitly mentioned, it cannot be determined that the performance meets the criteria for effectiveness as outlined in Article 478. Hence, the act is legally invalid.

9. (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: The performer acted in good faith and without negligence (Factor 3), and the obligee was enriched as a result of the performance (Factor 4). Although Article 479 discusses enrichment, when combined with good faith (and implicitly lack of negligence), there's a strong basis to argue for the performance's effectiveness. Thus, considering these factors together, the act can be seen as legally valid.

10. (2, 4 | N)
Justification: The unauthorized person appeared authorized based on common sense in transactions (Factor 2), and the obligee was enriched as a result (Factor 4). While appearance of authorization supports effectiveness under Article 478, enrichment alone (Article 479) does not guarantee full effectiveness without good faith or lack of negligence. Without explicit mention of these crucial elements, the performance's validity is questionable, making the act legally invalid under strict interpretation.

4. (Query entails 4) because it talks about the effect vis-a-vis the creditor, which can be related to enrichment.
5. (Query entails 5) since the concept of authority and quasi-possession involves intent and common sense in transactions.

For Task 2:

(Query Invalid) because the query states that any performance made to a person with no authority has no effect, implying legal invalidity under normal circumstances except for specific exceptions like quasi-possession.

 To determine whether a given query is legally valid within the context provided by Article 487, we must first break down the key elements presented in the article and then compare these against the query to assess their alignment.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Existence of an Instrument**: The article mentions the presence of "an instrument evidencing a claim," which implies that there is a document or some form of written proof supporting the claim.
2. **Full Performance by the Person**: It specifies that "the person making the performance has made full performance," indicating completion of the obligation or duty as outlined in the instrument.
3. **Right to Demand Return**: After full performance, the article grants the person who performed the obligation the right to demand the return of the instrument from the other party.
4. **Contextual Implication of Ownership or Responsibility**: The article implies that the person making the performance has a legitimate interest in the instrument, possibly as the owner or the party responsible for fulfilling the obligations outlined within it.

Given these factors, we assess whether a query logically follows the legal context provided by Article 487.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

To validate a query against Article 487, it must align with one or more of these factors, particularly addressing scenarios where full performance has been made and the conditions under which an instrument can be demanded back. If a query introduces elements not covered by these factors (e.g., partial performance, absence of an instrument, etc.) without logical connection to the article's context, it would not be considered valid.

Given that no specific query is provided for validation against Article 487 in your request, I'll illustrate with a hypothetical example:

- Hypothetical Query: "After completing all obligations as stated in the contract, can the performer of those obligations request the return of the contract document?"
  
This query would logically follow the context of Article 487 because it directly addresses the scenario where full performance has been made (Factor 2) and involves demanding the return of an instrument (Factor 3), which aligns with the rights granted by the article. Thus, for this hypothetical query, the answer would be "Y". 

However, without a specific query to evaluate against Article 487's factors, a definitive validation ("Y" or "N") cannot be provided in this response.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 487, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The existence of an instrument (Factor 1) and full performance by the person (Factor 2) are both present. Since the article specifies that after full performance, the person can demand the return of the instrument, this scenario is legally valid.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: Only the factor of demanding the return of the instrument (Factor 3) is present, without any context about full performance or the existence of an instrument. This lack of information makes it impossible to determine if the demand is legitimate, thus rendering the act invalid.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of an instrument (Factor 1) and the implication of ownership or responsibility (Factor 4) together suggest a legitimate interest in the instrument. Although full performance is not mentioned, the context implies that the person has a valid claim to the instrument, making this scenario legally valid.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Full performance (Factor 2) and demanding the return of the instrument (Factor 3) are both present. Since the article explicitly grants the right to demand the return after full performance, this combination of factors makes the act legally valid.

5. (1 | N) 
Justification: Only the existence of an instrument (Factor 1) is mentioned, without any context about performance or demanding its return. This lack of information does not provide enough basis to determine the legal validity of any action related to the instrument.

6. (4 | N) 
Justification: The implication of ownership or responsibility (Factor 4) alone does not provide sufficient context to assess the legal validity of demanding the return of an instrument, especially without mention of full performance or even the existence of such an instrument.

7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Full performance (Factor 2) and the implication of ownership or responsibility (Factor 4) together suggest that not only has the obligation been fulfilled but also that there is a legitimate interest in the outcome. This combination supports the legal validity of the act.

8. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The existence of an instrument (Factor 1) and demanding its return (Factor 3) imply a context where the person has completed their obligations and now seeks to reclaim the instrument as per the article's provisions, making this scenario legally valid.

9. (2 | N) 
Justification: Full performance (Factor 2) by itself does not automatically grant the right to demand the return of an instrument without knowing if such an instrument exists or if there was an agreement that included its return upon completion.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: All factors are present: an instrument exists (Factor 1), full performance has been made (Factor 2), the person demands the return of the instrument (Factor 3), and there's an implication of ownership or responsibility (Factor 4). This comprehensive scenario aligns perfectly with Article 487, making the act legally valid.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the given article, let's break down the process into steps and apply these to the provided legal article and a hypothetical query.

### Given Article
The article discusses the scenario where a third party obligor performs an obligation to their own obligee after the claim has been attached by another party. It outlines the rights of the attaching obligee to request performance de novo (again) from the third party obligor, up to the extent of the damage sustained, and mentions that this does not preclude the third party obligor's right to seek reimbursement.

### Hypothetical Query
Let's assume a query: "After a claim is attached, if the third party obligor performs their obligation to the original obligee, they cannot seek reimbursement for the amount they performed."

### Begin Factoring
1. **Claim Attachment**: The process by which one party (the attaching obligee) secures a claim against another's (the obligor's) asset or right.
2. **Third Party Obligor Performance**: The action of performing an obligation by a third party to their own obligee despite the attachment.
3. **Right to Request De Novo Performance**: The attaching obligee's entitlement to request the third party obligor to perform again, up to the extent of damage sustained.
4. **Reimbursement Right**: The right of the third party obligor to seek reimbursement from their original obligee for any performance made under these circumstances.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given this factoring and applying it to our hypothetical query, we can see that the query contradicts factor 4 (Reimbursement Right), which explicitly states that the provisions do not preclude the relevant third party obligor from exercising their right to reimbursement. Therefore, based on the article's content, the query is **N** (not legally valid with the context of the article) because it inaccurately suggests that the third party obligor cannot seek reimbursement after performing their obligation following a claim attachment.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given article and factors, here are 10 case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The attaching obligee has the right to request performance de novo from the third party obligor after the claim attachment, and the third party obligor performs their obligation to their own obligee, which is a valid scenario according to the article.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The attaching obligee's entitlement to request de novo performance and the third party obligor's right to seek reimbursement are both acknowledged in the article, making this combination legally valid.

3. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The claim attachment and the attaching obligee's right to request de novo performance are fundamental aspects of the article, rendering this scenario legally valid.

4. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: If the third party obligor performs their obligation without the claim being attached first, it contradicts the premise of the article, which specifies that the claim must be attached before the third party obligor's performance is considered under these rules.

5. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The claim attachment and the right to reimbursement are both recognized in the article, making this scenario legally valid as it aligns with the provisions regarding obligations after attachment.

6. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: This combination suggests that performance by the third party obligor to their own obligee automatically grants a right to request de novo performance without an initial claim attachment, which misinterprets the article's sequence of events and conditions for such rights.

7. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The mere occurrence of a claim attachment does not invalidate any obligations; rather, it sets the stage for the application of the article's provisions regarding third party obligors' performances and reimbursement rights.

8. (4 | N) 
Justification: If only the right to reimbursement is considered without the context of claim attachment or performance by a third party obligor, it isolates a provision from its necessary conditions and prerequisites outlined in the article, potentially leading to misapplication.

9. (2 | N) 
Justification: Performance by a third party obligor to their own obligee, without any reference to an initial claim attachment or subsequent rights of other parties involved (like requesting de novo performance), lacks crucial context for determining legal validity under this specific article.

10. (3 | Y) 
Justification: The right to request de novo performance is explicitly granted in the article as a consequence of certain actions following a claim attachment, making its occurrence alone within the framework of the article legally valid and understandable within the given statutory context.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and provides a justification based on the article's content for determining whether the scenario described would be considered legally valid (Y) or not (N).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing the Query for Each Factor
First, we need to assess whether the query entails each of the factors listed:
1. **Claim Attachment**: The query mentions a third party obligor who has been enjoined from making payment, which implies a claim attachment scenario.
2. **Third Party Obligor Performance**: The query states that the third party obligor has paid his/her obligation to his/her own obligee, indicating performance.
3. **Right to Request De Novo Performance**: The query suggests that the relevant obligee shall not be entitled to request such third party obligor to make payment, even to the extent of damages suffered, which directly relates to this factor.
4. **Reimbursement Right**: The query does not explicitly mention the right of the third party obligor to seek reimbursement from their original obligee.

## Step 2: Determining Entailment for Each Factor
Based on the assessment:
- (Query entails 1) because it involves a scenario where a claim is attached or payment is enjoined.
- (Query entails 2) since it mentions the third party obligor performing their obligation.
- (Query entails 3) as it discusses the right to request de novo performance, albeit in a negative context.
- (Query not entails 4) because it does not mention reimbursement rights.

## Step 3: Evaluating Query Validity
To determine if the query is valid or invalid according to the given article:
The article states that if a third party obligor performs their obligation after attachment, the attaching obligee can request performance de novo up to the extent of damage sustained. However, the query claims that the relevant obligee shall not be entitled to request such payment, even to the extent of damages suffered, which contradicts the article's provision.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

 To analyze the given query with respect to Article 485, we first need to factor the article into its key components to understand its implications and then compare these with the query to determine validity.

### Begin Factoring
1. **General Rule on Expenses**: Unless a particular intention is manifested, the expenses of performance are borne by the obligor.
2. **Exception for Increased Expenses**: If the obligee causes the expenses of performance to increase (e.g., by relocating the domicile or taking another act), the amount of this increase is borne by the obligee.
3. **Manifestation of Intention**: The article implies that a particular intention regarding who bears the expenses can alter the general rule, but it must be manifested.
4. **Obligor's Responsibility**: Generally, the obligor is responsible for the expenses of performance.
5. **Obligee's Responsibility in Case of Increase**: The obligee is responsible for any increase in expenses caused by their actions.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we are to evaluate a query but no specific query was provided, I will create a hypothetical query based on the content of Article 485 to demonstrate how one might assess its validity:

Query: If an obligee relocates, causing the expenses of performance to increase, they are responsible for these additional costs.

To determine if this query is legally valid within the context of Article 485:
- The article specifies that if the obligee's actions (like relocation) cause an increase in expenses, they are indeed responsible for this increase. 
- This directly aligns with factor 2 (**Exception for Increased Expenses**), indicating that the query logically follows from the legal context provided by Article 485.

Therefore, based on the hypothetical query and the factors identified from Article 485, the answer would be **Y**, as the query directly reflects a scenario described in the article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 485, I will generate 10 case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The general rule states that the expenses of performance are borne by the obligor unless a particular intention is manifested. Since factor 1 is present, indicating the general rule applies, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If the obligee causes an increase in expenses and they are responsible for this increase, it aligns with the exception to the general rule. The presence of factors 2 and 5 indicates that the obligee's actions led to increased expenses, making them responsible for these costs, thus the juridical act is legally valid.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: If a particular intention regarding who bears the expenses is manifested but no other factors are present to guide how this intention affects the distribution of expenses, it cannot be determined if the juridical act aligns with Article 485 without knowing the specifics of this intention. Therefore, the juridical act's validity cannot be confirmed based solely on factor 3.

4. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The general rule (factor 1) states that expenses are borne by the obligor, and factor 4 reiterates the obligor's responsibility for these expenses. Since both factors point to the obligor being responsible without any exception being triggered, the juridical act is legally valid.

5. (2 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of factor 2 indicates that the obligee caused an increase in expenses and thus should bear the cost of this increase. This scenario directly reflects a situation described in Article 485 as an exception to the general rule, making the juridical act legally valid.

6. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If a particular intention is manifested (factor 3) and it clarifies that the obligor is responsible for the expenses (factor 4), then this aligns with or further specifies the general rule, depending on the nature of the intention. Given that factor 4 explicitly states the obligor's responsibility, the juridical act can be considered legally valid.

7. (5 | N) 
Justification: Factor 5 alone indicates the obligee is responsible for any increase in expenses they cause but does not provide context on whether such an increase occurred or how it relates to the general distribution of expenses. Without additional factors, the juridical act's validity cannot be determined based solely on the obligee's potential responsibility for increased costs.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes the general rule (factor 1), an exception due to the obligee's actions (factor 2), and a manifested particular intention (factor 3). If the intention clarifies that despite the obligee causing an increase in expenses, they should still bear these additional costs as per factor 2, then the juridical act is legally valid.

9. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Factors 4 and 5 together indicate that the obligor generally bears the expenses of performance, but if the obligee causes an increase in these expenses, they are responsible for this increase. This scenario reflects a clear application of both the general rule and an exception, making the juridical act legally valid.

10. (1, 3, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive combination includes the general rule (factor 1), a manifested particular intention (factor 3), the obligor's responsibility (factor 4), and the obligee's responsibility for increased expenses (factor 5). Assuming the particular intention does not contradict but rather clarifies these responsibilities, the juridical act would be legally valid as it encompasses both general principles and specific exceptions.

 ### Begin Factoring
1. A claim can be extinguished by prescription.
2. If a claim was eligible for set-off before its extinguishment, it can still be used for set-off after being extinguished.
3. The article specifically mentions the condition "prior to its extinguishment" for eligibility of set-off.
4. The query needs to logically follow from these conditions regarding the use of an extinguished claim for set-off.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given the provided article and understanding the principles outlined, let's analyze a potential query: "Can an obligee use a claim that was never eligible for set-off before its extinguishment for set-off after it has been extinguished by prescription?"

To determine if this query is legally valid with the context of Article 508, we must see if it logically follows from the factors outlined. 

- The article clearly states that only claims eligible for set-off prior to their extinguishment can be used for set-off afterward.
- The query posits a scenario where the claim was not eligible for set-off before its extinguishment.

Since the article specifically requires eligibility for set-off "prior to its extinguishment," and the query asks about using a claim that did not meet this criterion, it does not logically follow from the conditions outlined in Article 508. 

Therefore, the response to whether the query is legally valid with the context of the article would be: N

This is because the key factor missing or not met in the query is the condition of eligibility for set-off before the claim's extinguishment, which is a necessary requirement according to Article 508.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 508, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: If a claim can be extinguished by prescription and was eligible for set-off before its extinguishment, then according to Article 508, the obligee may use that claim for set-off.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: The presence of the condition "prior to its extinguishment" alone does not determine the validity of using an extinguished claim for set-off without considering eligibility for set-off before extinguishment.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If a claim can be extinguished by prescription and the query logically follows from the conditions regarding the use of an extinguished claim for set-off, it implies that the scenario is being evaluated based on the principles outlined in Article 508, which could potentially validate its use for set-off if other conditions are met.

4. (2 | Y) 
Justification: If a claim was eligible for set-off before its extinguishment, this directly aligns with Article 508's stipulation that such claims can still be used for set-off after being extinguished.

5. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Knowing that a claim can be extinguished by prescription and that there is a condition of "prior to its extinguishment" does not inherently validate the use of any extinguished claim for set-off without the crucial factor of eligibility for set-off before extinguishment.

6. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If a claim was eligible for set-off before its extinguishment and the query logically follows from the conditions outlined, then it stands to reason that Article 508 would permit the use of such a claim for set-off after its extinguishment.

7. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario includes all necessary factors - a claim can be extinguished by prescription, was eligible for set-off before its extinguishment, and meets the "prior to its extinguishment" condition. Thus, according to Article 508, it is valid to use such a claim for set-off.

8. (4 | N) 
Justification: Without any information about the claim's eligibility for set-off or its status regarding prescription, simply having a query that logically follows from the conditions does not provide enough basis to determine legal validity under Article 508.

9. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If a claim can be extinguished by prescription, was eligible for set-off before this occurred, and the scenario is evaluated based on logical consistency with Article 508's conditions, then it should be legally valid to use such a claim for set-off.

10. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Having the condition "prior to its extinguishment" and a query that logically follows from the outlined conditions does not suffice to validate using an extinguished claim for set-off without knowing if the claim was eligible for set-off before its extinguishment.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

# Task 1:
Given the query "In cases where an active claim extinguished due to prescription, set-off may not be performed, but the adverse party may abandon the benefits of prescription and effect the set-off," let's assess whether it entails each factor:

1. A claim can be extinguished by prescription: (Query entails 1)
2. If a claim was eligible for set-off before its extinguishment, it can still be used for set-off after being extinguished: The query does not directly address eligibility prior to extinguishment but implies conditions under which set-off may or may not occur post-extinguishment. Thus, it doesn't directly entail this factor as stated in the article.
3. The article specifically mentions the condition "prior to its extinguishment" for eligibility of set-off: (Query not entails 3) because the query does not mention the requirement of being eligible prior to extinguishment explicitly in relation to the conditions under which a set-off can occur post-extinguishment.
4. The query needs to logically follow from these conditions regarding the use of an extinguished claim for set-off: Given that the query introduces a scenario where despite prescription, set-off may still be possible if the adverse party abandons prescription benefits, it does imply a consideration of how claims can be used post-extinguishment but doesn't directly align with or explicitly contradict factor 4 without further context on what "logically follow" entails in this specific legal framework.

# Task 2:
Given the query, we're asked to determine if it's valid or invalid regarding juridical acts or obligations being legally valid. The query presents a scenario under which an adverse party may choose to abandon benefits of prescription to effect set-off, suggesting a condition under which certain actions might be taken post-prescription that could influence legal outcomes. However, the query itself does not explicitly state that such actions are legally valid or invalid; it rather posits a hypothetical condition without judgment on its validity within the context provided.

Given this analysis and based on the instruction for Task 2:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To evaluate the query regarding Article 550, we need to break down the information provided into key factors and then assess how these factors relate to the query's validity within the context of the article.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Article Context**: The article discusses gifts that are not in writing.
2. **Cancellation Provision**: Either party can cancel a gift not in writing.
3. **Performance Exception**: Cancellation does not apply to portions of the gift where performance has been completed.
4. **Query Relevance**: The query's validity hinges on whether it aligns with these provisions.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given that the specific query is not provided, we can infer a general approach based on the factors identified:

- If a query suggests that gifts not in writing can be cancelled without exception (ignoring the performance completion aspect), it would **not** logically follow the article's context because it misses the crucial factor of performance completion.
- If a query implies that completed portions of a gift are subject to cancellation, it would also **not** align with the article, as this directly contradicts the performance exception stated.

Without the specific query details, we can deduce that for any query to be considered valid (responded with "Y"), it must acknowledge and respect both the general provision for cancellation of unwritten gifts and the specific exception regarding completed performances. Any query that neglects or contradicts these factors would not logically follow the article's context, leading to a response of "N".
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided for Article 550, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: If a gift is not in writing and either party cancels it, this action falls under the article's provision allowing cancellation of unwritten gifts.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: If only the performance exception is considered without the context of a gift not in writing or the cancellation provision, the scenario doesn't fully align with the conditions under which cancellation can be legally disputed.

3. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: For gifts not in writing where a portion's performance has been completed, attempting to cancel that specific portion would not be valid according to the article's exception.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: If either party cancels a gift and there's an exception for portions with completed performance, this scenario directly aligns with the article's conditions regarding cancellation and exceptions.

5. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive scenario covers all aspects of Article 550—gifts not in writing, cancellation by either party, and the exception for completed performances—making it a clear case where the juridical act is legally valid.

6. (4 | N) 
Justification: Considering only the query's relevance without the context of gifts not in writing or the specific provisions regarding cancellation and performance exceptions does not provide enough basis to determine legal validity based on Article 550.

7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If a gift is not in writing and its query relevance is considered, but no mention of cancellation or performance completion is made, it could still be seen as valid because it doesn't directly contradict the article's provisions.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A scenario where either party can cancel a gift and the query is relevant could imply that the cancellation provision is being considered in a contextually appropriate manner, thus potentially valid.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: If only the performance exception and query relevance are considered without acknowledging the cancellation provision or the nature of the gift (not in writing), it may not fully align with Article 550's stipulations for determining legal validity.

10. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario includes gifts not in writing, the ability to cancel by either party, and the relevance of the query, suggesting a comprehensive consideration of Article 550's main points, thereby supporting its legal validity.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors from Article 550 and assesses whether the juridical act or obligations are legally valid based on those factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1 in the Query
The query states, "Either the donor or the donee may revoke gifts not in writing. However, that this shall not apply for any portion of the gift for which performance has been completed." This directly references gifts not in writing, aligning with the article's context.

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2 in the Query
The query mentions that either party (donor or donee) may revoke gifts not in writing, which matches the cancellation provision stated in Article 550.

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3 in the Query
The query also specifies that the revocation does not apply to portions of the gift for which performance has been completed, directly acknowledging the performance exception.

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4 in the Query
Given the query's alignment with factors 1 through 3, it inherently respects the provisions outlined in Article 550, making it relevant and valid within the article's context.

## Step 5: Determining Query Validity
The query explicitly outlines conditions under which gifts not in writing can be revoked, including an exception for completed performances. This directly aligns with the legal principles outlined in Article 550, indicating that the juridical acts (or obligations) described are legally valid.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1), (Query entails 2), (Query entails 3), (Query entails 4), (Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given article, we must first factor the article into its key components or factors and then analyze these factors in relation to the query. Given Article 643 and a hypothetical query, let's proceed with factoring the article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Definition of Mandate**: A mandate is an agreement where one party (the mandator) asks another party (the mandatory) to perform a juridical act.
2. **Condition for Effectiveness**: The mandate becomes effective upon acceptance by the second party (mandatory).
3. **Juridical Act Performance**: The essence of the mandate involves the performance of a juridical act by the mandatory on behalf of the mandator.
4. **Acceptance Requirement**: For a mandate to be considered valid, there must be an explicit or implicit acceptance by the mandatory.

### End of Factoring

Given that we are asked about the process without a specific query provided for Article 643, let's consider a hypothetical query: "A mandate is effective if one party asks another to perform a juridical act without needing any form of acceptance."

Analyzing this query against the factors:

- **Definition of Mandate** and **Condition for Effectiveness** are directly related because the mandate's effectiveness hinges on the request and subsequent performance.
- The **Acceptance Requirement** factor is crucial as it explicitly states that acceptance by the second party is necessary for the mandate to become effective.

The query suggests a mandate can be effective without acceptance, which contradicts factor 4 (**Acceptance Requirement**). Since this factor is present in the article and directly addressed, but the query ignores or misinterprets this requirement, we must conclude the query does not logically follow from the article.

**Number of factors : 4**

Given the discrepancy between the article's emphasis on acceptance for a mandate to be effective and the query's disregard for this necessity, the answer would be "N". This is because the query overlooks or intentionally omits a critical factor (acceptance) that the article clearly states as necessary for a mandate to become effective.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 643, I will generate 10 case scenarios using the factors:

1. **Definition of Mandate**
2. **Condition for Effectiveness**
3. **Juridical Act Performance**
4. **Acceptance Requirement**

Here are the case scenarios:

(1 | N)
Justification: Only the definition of mandate is present, but without acceptance or a request to perform a juridical act, the mandate cannot be considered effective.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Although there's a condition for effectiveness and a performance of a juridical act, without an explicit acceptance, the mandate remains invalid.

(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: With both the definition of mandate and acceptance requirement met, even if implicitly, we can argue that the essential elements of a mandate are present, making it valid.

(3, 4 | N)
Justification: Despite the presence of juridical act performance and acceptance, without a clear definition of mandate or condition for effectiveness, the situation does not constitute a valid mandate under Article 643.

(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: Given that both the condition for effectiveness (acceptance) and the acceptance requirement are met, we can infer that the mandate is valid, even if the definition of mandate is not explicitly stated or the juridical act performance is implied.

(1, 2 | N)
Justification: Having only the definition of mandate and a condition for effectiveness does not make the mandate effective without an explicit acceptance or performance of a juridical act.

(1, 3 | N)
Justification: The presence of the definition of mandate and juridical act performance is insufficient to establish a valid mandate without acceptance or clear conditions for effectiveness.

(2, 1, 4 | Y)
Justification: With all factors except juridical act performance explicitly mentioned, we can still conclude that the mandate is effective due to the presence of the definition, condition for effectiveness, and acceptance requirement.

(3, 1, 2 | N)
Justification: Even though there's a definition of mandate, a condition for effectiveness, and a performance of a juridical act, without explicit acceptance, we cannot conclude that the mandate is valid under Article 643.

(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: With all factors present—definition of mandate, condition for effectiveness, performance of a juridical act, and acceptance requirement—the mandate clearly meets all criteria outlined in Article 643 to be considered effective.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1:

1. **Definition of Mandate**: The query discusses a mandate contract being consensual and effective with an oral agreement, which aligns with the concept of one party asking another to perform a juridical act. Therefore, (Query entails 1).
2. **Condition for Effectiveness**: The query mentions that the mandate contract is effective if there is an oral agreement, implying acceptance by both parties, hence (Query entails 2).
3. **Juridical Act Performance**: While the query does not explicitly mention the performance of a juridical act, it talks about the effect of a mandate contract, which inherently involves such performance. So, we can infer (Query entails 3).
4. **Acceptance Requirement**: The query implies acceptance through oral agreement for the contract to be effective between the parties involved but also mentions documentation for effects on third parties, thus (Query entails 4).

### Task 2:

The query states that a mandate contract "shall be effective if there is an oral agreement," which indicates that the juridical acts or obligations are considered legally valid under certain conditions (oral agreement). It does not explicitly invalidate any juridical acts but rather outlines conditions for validity and effectiveness. Therefore, the answer to Task 2 is: (Query Valid)

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context of the given articles, we first need to factor the relevant information from the articles and then compare this with the query to assess its validity.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Creation and Transfer of Real Rights**: The creation and transfer of real rights are effective solely through the manifestations of intention by the parties involved (Article 176).
2. **Registration Requirement for Immovables**: For acquisitions, losses, or changes in real rights on immovables to be asserted against third parties, registration is required according to the Real Property Registration Act (Act No. 123 of 2004) and other relevant laws (Article 177).
3. **Effectiveness Against Third Parties**: Real rights on immovables are not duly asserted against any third parties unless registered.
4. **Manifestation of Intention**: The parties' intention is crucial for the creation and transfer of real rights.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given that no specific query is provided to assess its validity against these factored points, let's consider a hypothetical query to demonstrate how one might approach this task:

Query: "Does the registration of immovable property affect the creation of real rights between parties?"

To evaluate this query:
- It involves the concept of **registration** (Factor 2) and its necessity for asserting real rights against third parties.
- It touches upon the **effectiveness of real rights against third parties** (Factor 3), implying that registration is a crucial step in this process.
- However, it does not directly address the **manifestation of intention** (Factor 4) as a standalone requirement for creating or transferring real rights.

Given these considerations and assuming the query aims to understand if registration itself creates real rights (which it doesn't according to Article 176), one could argue that the query slightly misunderstands the role of registration. Registration is necessary for asserting rights against third parties but does not replace the need for the manifestation of intention by the parties.

Thus, without a specific query provided in your prompt, I'll proceed with a general assessment based on the hypothetical query above:

Response: N

Reasoning: The hypothetical query seems to conflate the role of registration with the creation of real rights. While registration is crucial for asserting these rights against third parties (as per Article 177), the actual creation and transfer of real rights depend solely on the manifestations of intention by the parties involved, as stated in Article 176.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Articles 176 and 177, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios to evaluate their legal validity.


1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The creation of real rights solely through the manifestations of intention by the parties is a valid juridical act according to Article 176.


2. (2 | N) 
Justification: Registration alone, without the manifestation of intention by the parties, does not create or transfer real rights as per Article 176 and thus is insufficient for a legally valid act.


3. (3 | N) 
Justification: The effectiveness against third parties requires registration, but on its own, it doesn't validate an unregistered transaction between parties, making this factor alone insufficient for legal validity.


4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Both the manifestation of intention by the parties and registration are present, fulfilling the requirements for both the creation/transfer of real rights and their assertion against third parties, as per Articles 176 and 177.


5. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of the parties' intention to create or transfer real rights and the consideration of effectiveness against third parties implies an understanding that registration is necessary for full legal effect, but the initial creation/transfer based on intention is valid.


6. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: This combination seems contradictory because if manifestation of intention (Factor 4) is present, then Factor 2 (registration requirement) being alone with it does not negate the validity of the act due to lack of clear intention for registration's role in this context.


7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of both the creation/transfer through manifestation of intention and the acknowledgment of parties' intentions being crucial makes the juridical act valid as it directly addresses Article 176's requirements.


8. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Without registration (as implied by Factor 3), and only considering effectiveness against third parties and the importance of manifestation of intention, the act is not fully legally valid because it lacks the necessary step of registration to assert these rights against others.


9. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of both registration and consideration for effectiveness against third parties indicates an understanding and compliance with Article 177, making the assertion of real rights against third parties legally valid.


10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: All factors are present, indicating that the creation/transfer of real rights is based on the manifestation of intention by the parties, registration has occurred for asserting these rights against third parties, and there's an understanding of both the importance of intention and registration, making the juridical act fully legally valid.


Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors to assess the legal validity of the juridical act based on Articles 176 and 177.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given query, let's first factor the provided article into its key components to understand the legal context it establishes.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Guarantor Responsibility**: A guarantor must perform the principal obligor's obligation if the latter fails.
2. **Written Guarantee Requirement**: A guarantee contract is only effective if made in writing.
3. **Electronic Records Consideration**: Electronic or magnetic records of guarantee contracts are considered as being made in writing.
### End of Factoring


<Number of factors : 3>

Given these factors, we can analyze the query's validity within the context provided by Article 446.


The query to validate is not explicitly stated, so I'll proceed with a hypothetical query that could be tested against this article: "A verbal guarantee contract is binding."


- **Factor 1 (Guarantor Responsibility)** does not directly address the form of the guarantee but rather the guarantor's role.
- **Factor 2 (Written Guarantee Requirement)** explicitly states that a guarantee contract must be in writing to be effective, which contradicts the notion of a verbal guarantee being binding.
- **Factor 3 (Electronic Records Consideration)** extends the definition of "in writing" to include electronic or magnetic records but does not validate verbal agreements.

Given these considerations, the hypothetical query about a verbal guarantee contract being binding would logically follow as invalid because it directly contradicts **Factor 2**, which requires a guarantee contract to be in writing to be effective.


Therefore, for any query that suggests a verbal guarantee contract is valid or implies that a guarantor's obligation can be established without a written agreement (including electronic records as per the article), the answer would be "N" due to the explicit requirement for a written contract as stated in **Factor 2**.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 446, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will consider a subset of the factors and determine whether the juridical act is legally valid or invalid.

1. (1 | N) 
Justification: The presence of Factor 1 (Guarantor Responsibility) alone does not validate a guarantee contract without it being in writing, as required by Factor 2.

2. (2 | Y) 
Justification: With only Factor 2 (Written Guarantee Requirement) present, the guarantee contract is made in writing and thus meets the requirement for being effective.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: Factor 3 (Electronic Records Consideration) alone does not validate a verbal or non-written agreement; it merely extends what can be considered "in writing" to include electronic records.

4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: When both Factors 1 and 2 are present, the guarantor's responsibility is clearly defined, and the contract is in writing, making the guarantee contract legally valid.

5. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Even with electronic records considered as being "in writing" (Factor 3), if the original agreement was not made in a form that can be considered written (including electronic), Factor 1's guarantor responsibility cannot make it valid without Factor 2.

6. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of Factors 2 and 3 ensures that the guarantee contract is both in writing (or its electronic equivalent) and thus meets all requirements for being legally effective.

7. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: With all factors present, the guarantor's responsibility is defined, the contract is in a written form (including electronic), making the guarantee contract fully compliant with Article 446 and therefore legally valid.

8. (None | N) 
Justification: Without any of the factors being met, there's no basis for considering a guarantee contract to be legally valid.

9. (2, without written proof | N) 
Justification: Even if Factor 2 is considered, without actual written proof (or its electronic equivalent as per Factor 3), the contract cannot be deemed legally valid.

10. (3, with verbal agreement | N) 
Justification: If a guarantee contract was verbally agreed upon but recorded electronically (meeting Factor 3's condition), it still doesn't fulfill the requirement of being initially made in writing as stipulated by Factor 2, thus making it invalid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors to assess the legal validity of a guarantee contract based on Article 446.

The query discusses a guarantor revoking a contract of guarantee that is not in writing, which implies a scenario where the guarantor's responsibility might be affected. However, it doesn't directly address the guarantor's role in performing the principal obligor's obligation when the latter fails. Thus, the query does not directly entail Factor 1.

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 2
The query explicitly mentions a contract of guarantee that is "not in writing," which directly relates to the requirement that a guarantee contract must be in writing to be effective as stated in Factor 2. Therefore, the query entails Factor 2.

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 3
Factor 3 discusses electronic or magnetic records being considered as written contracts. The query does not mention anything about electronic or magnetic records, so it does not entail Factor 3.

## Step 4: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query involves a contract of guarantee not in writing and mentions revocation with an exception for the portion performed, we need to assess if this scenario aligns with the legal validity as per Article 446. The article clearly states that no guarantee contract is effective unless it is made in writing, which suggests that a verbal or non-written guarantee contract would be legally invalid. However, the query's focus on revocation and performance of a portion of such a contract introduces complexity but does not change the fundamental issue of the contract's initial validity. Since the query implies dealing with a contract that should be invalid according to Factor 2 (because it's not in writing), but discusses actions (revocation) as if the contract had some form of validity, it presents a confusing scenario regarding legal validity.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

 To evaluate the legal validity of a query based on Article 702, we first need to factor the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Manager's Beneficial Expenses**: The manager has the right to claim reimbursement for beneficial expenses incurred on behalf of the principal.
2. **Application of Article 650**: The provisions of Article 650, paragraph (2), apply to managers who incur beneficial obligations for the principal.
3. **Benevolent Intervention**: If a manager intervenes in another's business against the principal's will, reimbursement or application of previous provisions is limited to the extent of current enrichment.
4. **Principal's Consent**: The article implies that the manager's actions are typically done with the principal's consent or understanding, except in cases of benevolent intervention against the principal's will.
5. **Reimbursement and Enrichment**: Reimbursement for expenses or obligations incurred by the manager is tied to the benefit or enrichment received by the principal.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we have factored the article into its key components, we can now evaluate queries against these factors to determine their legal validity within the context provided. However, since no specific query was provided for Article 702, I will demonstrate how to apply this factoring to a hypothetical query:

Hypothetical Query: A manager who incurred expenses on behalf of a principal without the principal's consent can claim full reimbursement.

Based on the factors:
- **Manager's Beneficial Expenses** suggests the manager has a right to reimbursement for beneficial expenses.
- **Benevolent Intervention** indicates that if the intervention was against the principal's will, reimbursement is limited to the extent of current enrichment.

This query seems to invalidate because it does not account for the limitation imposed by benevolent intervention against the principal's will. Thus, without knowing the specific query you'd like evaluated, I've outlined how one would approach determining legal validity based on Article 702's factors. If a query ignores or contradicts these established factors, especially concerning consent and the extent of enrichment, it would likely be considered legally invalid (N). Conversely, queries that align with these principles would be valid (Y). 

Please provide a specific query for a more precise determination.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 702, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a different combination of factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The manager has incurred beneficial expenses for the principal, which is a straightforward application of Article 702, allowing for reimbursement.

2. (2 | Y) 
Justification: The provisions of Article 650, paragraph (2), apply to managers who incur beneficial obligations for the principal, making this scenario legally valid.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: Benevolent intervention against the principal's will limits reimbursement to the extent of current enrichment, but without knowing the extent of enrichment or expenses, we cannot validate the claim fully.

4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Both factors are directly related to the manager's right to reimbursement for beneficial expenses and obligations incurred on behalf of the principal, making this scenario legally valid.

5. (4 | N) 
Justification: The absence of the principal's consent is crucial in determining legal validity, especially in cases of benevolent intervention against their will, but as a standalone factor without specific actions or outcomes, it's hard to validate any claim based solely on implied lack of consent.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Although the manager intervened without consent, reimbursement is limited to the extent of current enrichment, which can still be legally valid if there was indeed an enrichment to the principal.

7. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The application of Article 650 and the issue of principal's consent are crucial; however, if the principal did not consent to the obligations incurred under Article 650, the legal validity could be challenged.

8. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Benevolent intervention against the will of the principal, with reimbursement limited to the extent of current enrichment, directly ties into the factor of reimbursement and enrichment, making this scenario legally valid if there was indeed an enrichment.

9. (1, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The manager's beneficial expenses, the principal's consent (or lack thereof), and the tie to reimbursement and enrichment all contribute to a nuanced but potentially legally valid scenario, especially if the expenses directly led to the principal's enrichment.

10. (2, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: This combination involves the application of Article 650, benevolent intervention against the principal's will, and the issue of consent. Given the complexities and potential conflicts between these factors, especially the lack of consent and the limitations imposed by benevolent intervention, this scenario is likely to be legally invalid due to the significant challenges in validating the obligations incurred without clear consent and within the limits of current enrichment.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 1
The query discusses a person who commences the management of a business for another without being obliged to do so and expends useful expenses, which relates to the concept of beneficial expenses. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 2
There is no mention in the query about the application of Article 650 or any similar provisions regarding obligations incurred on behalf of the principal. Hence, (Query not entails 2).

## Step 3: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 3
The scenario described involves a benevolent intervention against the intention of the principal, which aligns with the concept of benevolent intervention in another's business against their will. Thus, (Query entails 3).

## Step 4: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 4
The query explicitly mentions that the management is against the intention of the principal, indicating a lack of consent. Therefore, (Query entails 4).

## Step 5: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 5
While the query talks about expending useful expenses, it does not directly tie the reimbursement to the extent of enrichment received by the principal in this context. So, (Query not entails 5).

## Step 6: Task 2 - Evaluating Query Validity
The query states that a person may not demand compensation from the principal for useful expenses when the management is against the principal's intention. This implies that under such circumstances, the juridical acts or obligations (in this case, demanding compensation) are considered legally invalid according to the given scenario.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

 To address the given problem, we first need to factor the provided legal article into its key components or factors to understand its structure and implications better.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Performance by a Third Party**: A third party can perform an obligation.
2. **Legitimate Interest Requirement**: For a third party with no legitimate interest, they cannot perform against the obligor's will unless the obligee is unaware of this opposition.
3. **Obligee's Knowledge and Consent**: The performance by a third party without legitimate interest can proceed if the obligee did not know about the obligor's opposition or if the third party acts as requested by the obligor with the obligee's knowledge.
4. **Exceptions Based on Obligation Nature**: Certain obligations may not allow for performance by a third party, either due to their nature or because a party has expressed an intention to prohibit or restrict such performance.
5. **Will of the Obligor and Obligee**: Both the obligor and obligee have roles in determining whether a third party can perform an obligation, with considerations including knowledge, consent, and legitimate interest.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 5

Given this factoring, we must consider how these factors apply to the query about determining the legal validity of performing an obligation by a third party according to Article 474. However, since there is no specific query provided for Article 474, let's create a hypothetical query and assess its validity based on the factors identified:

**Hypothetical Query**: A friend, without being asked by either the borrower or the lender, decides to pay off a loan on behalf of the borrower because they feel sorry for them. Is this action legally valid according to Article 474?

To evaluate the query's validity:
- The friend has no legitimate interest in performing the obligation (Factor 2).
- The query does not specify whether the obligor (borrower) or obligee (lender) knew about or consented to the third party's performance (Factors 3 and 5).
- There is no mention of the nature of the obligation prohibiting third-party performance or any expressed intention by the parties involved to restrict such performance (Factor 4).

Given these considerations, if we assume that the loan repayment does not inherently prohibit third-party payment (a common scenario where third-party payments are indeed possible), and without specific knowledge about the consent or awareness of the borrower and lender, the query's validity hinges on whether the friend's action aligns with Factors 2 and 3. If the obligee (lender) did not know that the performance was against the will of the obligor (borrower), or if the third party performed as requested by the obligor with the obligee's knowledge, then it could be considered valid. However, since our hypothetical scenario does not provide clear evidence regarding these conditions, we must approach with skepticism.

**Response**: Without a specific query provided for Article 474 and based on the hypothetical scenario created for illustrative purposes, if we strictly interpret the need for either the obligor's request or the obligee's unawareness of opposition (and considering typical loan repayment scenarios where third-party payments are allowed), the action could potentially be seen as valid under specific conditions not fully detailed in our hypothetical. However, since these specifics are crucial and not provided, a definitive answer would require more information about the parties' knowledge and consent.

Thus, based on the lack of direct query and the reliance on a hypothetical scenario for illustration, it's challenging to provide a straightforward "Y" or "N" without making assumptions beyond what's factored from Article 474. Nonetheless, for educational purposes and aligning with the requirement for an answer:

**Final Answer**: N (Given the absence of explicit details about consent and knowledge in our hypothetical query, and emphasizing the importance of these factors as outlined in Article 474.)
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 474, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of Factor 1 alone indicates that a third party can perform an obligation, which suggests that the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: With only Factor 2 present, the third party has no legitimate interest and cannot perform against the will of the obligor, making the act invalid without additional context or consent.

3. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Combining Factors 1 and 3, a third party can perform an obligation (Factor 1), and if the obligee did not know about the obligor's opposition or if it was done at the obligor's request with the obligee's knowledge (Factor 3), the act is considered valid.

4. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The combination of Factors 2 and 4 indicates that the third party lacks legitimate interest (Factor 2) and the nature of the obligation may not permit performance by a third party or there's an intention to restrict it (Factor 4), making the act invalid.

5. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Although Factor 1 generally allows a third party to perform an obligation, the presence of Factor 2 without additional consent or knowledge as described in Factor 3 makes the performance against the obligor's will invalid.

6. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This combination suggests that despite potential restrictions based on the nature of the obligation (Factor 4), if the conditions in Factor 3 are met (obligee unaware or third party acts as requested by the obligor with the obligee's knowledge), the act can still be valid.

7. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: With Factors 1 and 5 present, the will of both the obligor and obligee is considered, allowing for a third party to perform the obligation if their interests are aligned or properly accounted for, making the act valid.

8. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although Factor 3 provides conditions under which performance could be valid despite the lack of legitimate interest by the third party (Factor 2), without explicit mention that these conditions are met, we lean towards invalidity due to the absence of a legitimate interest as a foundational requirement.

9. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: The combination of Factors 4 and 5 indicates restrictions or prohibitions based on the nature of the obligation or expressions by the parties involved, which suggests that allowing a third party to perform would not be legally valid without explicit consent or alignment with these factors.

10. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes all elements necessary for a valid performance by a third party: the general ability to perform (Factor 1), consideration of legitimate interest and opposition (Factors 2 and 3). If the obligee is unaware or if the performance is at the obligor's request with the obligee's knowledge, the act can be considered valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict based on Article 474.

 To evaluate the query's validity with respect to Article 462, let's first break down the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Guarantee Without Request**: A person can give a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor.
2. **Performance of Obligation Extinguishment**: The guarantor performs an act to extinguish the obligation.
3. **Right to Reimbursement**: The guarantor has a right to reimbursement but only to the extent currently enriched.
4. **Set-off Assertion by Principal Obligor**: If the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off against the obligee, the guarantor can demand performance of the obligation that would have been extinguished by that set-off.
5. **PreDue Date Performance**: The provisions regarding reimbursement apply if the guarantor performs an act to extinguish the obligation before the due date of the principal obligation.
6. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**: The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraphs (1) and (3), apply mutatis mutandis to certain scenarios described in Article 462.

### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 6

Given that there is no specific query provided to evaluate against the factored components of Article 462, I will create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes: "Can a guarantor who has given a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor demand reimbursement after performing an act to extinguish the obligation?"

Based on the factors extracted from Article 462:

- The article specifically mentions that a person who gives a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation can apply mutatis mutandis the provisions related to reimbursement (Factors 1, 2, and 3).
- It also outlines conditions under which the guarantor can demand performance related to set-offs asserted by the principal obligor (Factor 4).

Given these points, a query about demanding reimbursement after performing an act to extinguish the obligation would be considered valid because it directly relates to the conditions and rights outlined in Article 462 for such scenarios. Therefore, if we were evaluating this hypothetical query against the article:

The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 462, I will generate 10 case scenarios to determine the validity of the juridical act or obligations. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: If a person gives a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation, the provisions of Article 459-2 apply mutatis mutandis, indicating that the guarantor's actions can lead to a valid claim for reimbursement.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When a guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched and the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off against the obligee, the guarantor can demand performance of the obligation that would have been extinguished by that set-off, making the juridical act valid.

3. (5 | N) 
Justification: If the guarantor performs an act to extinguish the obligation before the due date of the principal obligation without any other factors being present, it does not inherently invalidate the act, but according to Article 462, specific provisions apply in such cases, suggesting that additional conditions must be met for validity.

4. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: A person who gives a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor and has a right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched can make a valid claim under the conditions outlined in Article 462.

5. (2, 6 | Y) 
Justification: When a guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation and the provisions of Article 459-2 apply mutatis mutandis, it indicates that the guarantor's actions are subject to specific legal conditions, potentially leading to a valid juridical act.

6. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off against the obligee and the guarantor performs an act to extinguish the obligation before the due date of the principal obligation, the guarantor can demand performance related to the set-off, making the act valid under Article 462.

7. (1, 6 | Y) 
Justification: A person who gives a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor and is subject to the mutatis mutandis application of Article 459-2's provisions can engage in a valid juridical act, as the legal framework applies to their situation.

8. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: When a guarantor has a right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched and performs an act to extinguish the obligation before the due date of the principal obligation, they can make a valid claim for reimbursement under the specified conditions.

9. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If a guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation and the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off against the obligee, the guarantor's demand for performance related to the set-off can be considered valid under Article 462.

10. (1, 5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: A person who gives a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act to extinguish the obligation before the due date of the principal obligation, and is subject to the mutatis mutandis application of Article 459-2's provisions can engage in a valid juridical act, as all these conditions together still fall under the regulatory framework provided by Article 462.

Given the factored components, we can analyze queries against these factors to determine their legal validity within the context provided. However, without a specific query to evaluate against these factors, it's not possible to provide a "Y" or "N" response as requested.

To proceed with an actual analysis of a query, please provide the specific sentence or question you'd like evaluated against the context of these articles.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors extracted from the articles:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: In this scenario, both Contract Performance Requirement and Notice and Time Period for Performance are present. If a party fails to perform their contractual duties despite being given a reasonable period of time to do so, the other party can cancel the contract, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: Grounds for Immediate Cancellation alone does not necessarily make a contract invalid. However, if the grounds for immediate cancellation are not met, and no other factors are present, the contract cannot be deemed invalid solely based on this factor.

3. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: When both Partial Cancellation and Applicability to Contracts for Value are applicable, it means that part of a contract can be cancelled under certain conditions, and these provisions apply to contracts other than sales contracts. This scenario suggests that the juridical act is tailored to specific contractual needs, making it legally valid.

4. (1, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of Contract Performance Requirement and Right to Claim Compensation indicates that a party can seek damages if the other party fails to perform their contractual duties. This combination upholds the principle of contract law that parties must fulfill their obligations or face consequences, making the juridical act legally valid.

5. (2, 7 | N) 
Justification: Notice and Time Period for Performance along with Exceptions Based on Contract Nature might suggest that certain contracts are exempt from the usual rules regarding performance periods due to their nature. However, without clear grounds for cancellation or performance requirements being met, this combination does not inherently validate the juridical act.

6. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Grounds for Immediate Cancellation and Partial Cancellation together imply that a contract can be immediately cancelled in whole or in part under specific conditions. This flexibility in addressing contractual breaches supports the legal validity of the juridical act.

7. (5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Applicability to Contracts for Value and Right to Claim Compensation being present means that these provisions extend beyond sales contracts, allowing parties to seek compensation for losses incurred due to non-performance. This applicability and right to claim damages make the juridical act legally valid.

8. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Contract Performance Requirement combined with Grounds for Immediate Cancellation indicates that if a party fails to perform their duties under conditions that allow for immediate cancellation, the contract can indeed be cancelled. This scenario upholds contractual integrity and the consequences of non-compliance, making the juridical act legally valid.

9. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Notice and Time Period for Performance along with Partial Cancellation suggest that after giving a reasonable time period for performance, if part of the contract cannot be fulfilled, that part can be cancelled. This approach to managing contractual obligations supports the legal validity of the juridical act.

10. (6, 7 | N) 
Justification: Right to Claim Compensation and Exceptions Based on Contract Nature alone do not provide sufficient grounds for determining the legal validity of a contract without considering performance requirements or cancellation provisions. The presence of exceptions based on the nature of the contract could complicate the straightforward application of compensation claims, potentially making the juridical act invalid due to ambiguity or lack of clear contractual obligations.

Given the query is not provided, I will need it to assess its validity against the factored components of the legal article. However, based on the information given:

- If a query pertains to the future effect of cancellation and allows for compensation claims post-cancellation in lease or partnership contracts, it would likely be valid (Y).
- If a query suggests that cancellation affects past periods or precludes all forms of claims, it would be invalid (N) as it contradicts the first two factors.
- Queries about other types of contracts not specified here might also lead to an answer of N unless they can be logically extended from the provided information on leases and partnerships.

Please provide a specific query for a more precise assessment.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 620 and Article 684, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The cancellation of a lease affects only future periods, and claims for compensation due to loss or damage are not precluded. This scenario aligns perfectly with the articles, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: While the rules apply to partnership contracts, without any details on cancellation effect or compensation claims, we cannot determine validity solely based on the applicability to partnerships. Thus, this case lacks sufficient information for a positive determination.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The cancellation affects future periods in lease contracts, which are specifically mentioned as subject to these rules. This aligns with the articles' stipulations regarding lease cancellations and their effects.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Claims for compensation due to loss or damage are permissible post-cancellation in both leases and partnership contracts, according to the articles. This scenario upholds the principles outlined for handling such situations after a contract is cancelled.

5. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Combining the cancellation's future effect with the allowance of compensation claims in both lease and partnership contracts directly aligns with all stipulated conditions in the articles, making this scenario legally valid.

6. (4 | N) 
Justification: Simply stating that a contract is of a type mentioned (lease or partnership) without any details on cancellation effects or claims for compensation does not provide enough information to determine legal validity based on the articles provided.

7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The ability to claim compensation due to loss or damage post-cancellation in contracts specifically mentioned (leases and partnerships) adheres to the principles outlined in the articles, supporting the legal validity of such actions.

8. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: When considering the future effect of cancellation in partnership contracts, this scenario aligns with the application of lease rules to partnerships as stipulated, indicating a legally valid situation under these specific conditions.

9. (2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This combination covers compensation claims in both lease and partnership contracts, applying the rules for future effects post-cancellation across specified contract types, which aligns with the articles' provisions.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Including all factors—future effect of cancellation, allowance of compensation claims, applicability to partnerships, and specific mention of contract types—this scenario comprehensively adheres to all stipulations outlined in the articles, making it legally valid without any doubt.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 1
The query states, "The cancellation of a partnership contract shall solely become effective toward the future." This directly aligns with the first factor, which is about the effect of cancellation being solely toward the future. Since the query specifies that the cancellation becomes effective toward the future, it entails factor 1.

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 2
The query does not mention anything about compensation for loss or damage, so it does not directly entail factor 2, which deals with claims for compensation due to loss or damage post-cancellation.

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 3
The query is about partnership contracts and their cancellation being effective toward the future, which aligns with the principle that rules regarding lease cancellations also apply to partnership contracts (mutatis mutandis) as stated in factor 3. Thus, it entails factor 3.

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 4
The query specifically mentions a "partnership contract," which is one of the types of contracts mentioned in the factored components (factor 4). Therefore, it entails factor 4.

## Step 5: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query aligns with the legal principles outlined in the articles, particularly regarding the future effect of cancellation and its applicability to partnership contracts, we can conclude about its validity based on these alignments.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1)}$

 ### Begin Factoring
To analyze the given query pair with the legal article, let's first break down the key elements presented in Article 545 into understandable factors:

1. **Right to Cancel**: The article mentions that one of the parties can exercise the right to cancel.
2. **Restoration of Original State**: Upon cancellation, each party must restore the other to its original state.
3. **Prejudice to Third Party Rights**: Restoration should not prejudice the rights of a third party.
4. **Refund and Interest**: If monies are to be refunded, interest accrues from the time of receipt.
5. **Return of Non-Monetary Items**: For items other than money, fruits or benefits accrued after receipt must also be returned.
6. **Claims for Compensation**: The right to cancel does not preclude claims for loss or damage compensation.

Given these factors and without a specific query provided in your request, it's essential to note that any query would need to align with these principles to be considered legally valid within the context of Article 545.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 6>

To assess the validity of a query based on Article 545, one must consider whether the query respects the principles outlined in these factors. For instance:

- Does the query respect the right to cancel and the obligations that follow?
- Does it account for the restoration of parties to their original state without harming third-party rights?
- Are considerations for refunds, including interest, and the return of non-monetary items with their accrued benefits properly addressed?
- Does the query acknowledge the possibility of claiming compensation for loss or damage despite the cancellation?

Without a specific query provided, it's not possible to give a definitive "Y" or "N" answer. However, any query that aligns with these factors and does not contradict them would likely be considered legally valid within the context of Article 545.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 545, I will generate 10 case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The right to cancel is exercised, and both parties agree to restore each other to their original state, which aligns with the article's requirements.

2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the exercise of the right to cancel does not prejudice third-party rights and claims for compensation are possible, without restoration or refund considerations, the juridical act is incomplete and thus invalid.

3. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The right to cancel is exercised, and non-monetary items with their accrued benefits are returned, which satisfies key obligations outlined in the article.

4. (2, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Restoration of original states and consideration for claims of compensation indicate a thorough approach to cancellation that respects the article's requirements.

5. (1, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The exercise of the right to cancel, combined with the restoration of original states without prejudicing third-party rights and allowing for compensation claims, adheres to the article's stipulations.

6. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Restoration to the original state and the return of non-monetary items with their accrued benefits demonstrate compliance with significant aspects of the article.

7. (4, 6 | N) 
Justification: While claims for compensation are considered, without any mention of restoration or the exercise of the right to cancel, the scenario lacks critical elements required by the article.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The right to cancel is exercised with mutual restoration to original states and without prejudice to third-party rights, fulfilling core requirements of the article.

9. (5, 6 | N) 
Justification: Although non-monetary items are returned with their benefits, and there's consideration for compensation claims, the absence of any mention of the right to cancel or restoration to original states renders the scenario incomplete.

10. (1, 2, 4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive approach includes exercising the right to cancel, restoring parties to their original state, considering refunds with interest, and allowing for compensation claims, fully aligning with the article's provisions.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 545, leading to a determinate verdict based on the occurrence of these factors.

(Query not entails 6)

# Task 2:
(Query Invalid) 

Reasoning: 
For Task 1, the query mentions the cancellation of a sales contract and the obligations following it, which aligns with factor 1 (Right to Cancel). It also talks about returning the portion of the purchase price, implying restoration to the original state (factor 2). Additionally, it discusses compensation for damages (factor 4). However, it does not mention anything about prejudice to third-party rights (factor 3), return of non-monetary items with their accrued benefits (factor 5), or explicitly mentions claims for compensation in a manner that suggests it's an additional consideration beyond the mentioned scenario (factor 6).

For Task 2, the query is considered invalid because it contradicts Article 545 by stating there is no need to add interest from the time of receipt when returning the portion of the purchase price. According to Article 545(2), if any monies are to be refunded, interest must accrue from the time of the receipt of those monies. The query's assertion against this principle makes it legally invalid within the context provided.

 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we must first factor the article into its key components or factors and then assess how these factors interact with the query in question.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Manifestation of Intention**: The article discusses the concept of a manifestation of intention being voidable under certain conditions.
2. **Mistake Types**: It identifies two types of mistakes that can render a manifestation of intention voidable - (i) lacking the corresponding intention, and (ii) holding an incorrect understanding of the circumstances.
3. **Materiality of Mistake**: The mistake must be material in light of the purpose of the juridical act and common sense in transactions.
4. **Indication of Basis for Juridical Act**: For mistakes regarding circumstances (type ii), the manifestation can only be rescinded if it was indicated that those circumstances were the basis for the act.
5. **Gross Negligence Exception**: A person cannot rescind a manifestation due to mistake if the mistake resulted from their gross negligence, except in specific cases involving the other party's knowledge or shared mistake.
6. **Effect on Third Parties**: The rescission of a manifestation of intention may not be asserted against a third party acting in good faith without negligence.

### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 6

Given that we are to assess queries based on this factored list, please provide the query you'd like me to evaluate against these factors. I will then determine whether the query logically follows from the article (Y) or does not (N), explaining my reasoning based on the presence or absence of these factors in relation to the query.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 95, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of these factors occurred. For each scenario, I'll justify whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. **(1 | N)**: In this case, only the factor of "Manifestation of Intention" is present, with no additional context about mistakes or other conditions. Since a manifestation of intention alone does not guarantee validity without considering potential mistakes or negligence, the juridical act cannot be assumed valid by default.

2. **(1, 2 | N)**: This scenario includes both "Manifestation of Intention" and "Mistake Types." Given that there are mistakes involved (either lacking corresponding intention or incorrect understanding of circumstances), without more information on materiality or indication of basis for the juridical act, we cannot conclude the act is valid.

3. **(1, 2, 3 | N)**: Here, we add "Materiality of Mistake" to the previous scenario. Since the mistake must be material and there's no mention of it being so or not, coupled with potential mistakes in intention or understanding, this does not automatically validate the juridical act.

4. **(1, 3 | Y)**: In this case, we have "Manifestation of Intention" and "Materiality of Mistake." If the mistake is not material, it suggests that the purpose of the juridical act or common sense in transactions was not significantly impacted. Therefore, without evidence of significant error, the act could be considered valid.

5. **(2, 4 | N)**: This scenario involves "Mistake Types" and "Indication of Basis for Juridical Act." If there are mistakes about circumstances and these were indicated as the basis for the act, but without considering materiality or negligence, we cannot validate the act due to potential for significant error.

6. **(1, 4 | Y)**: With "Manifestation of Intention" and "Indication of Basis for Juridical Act," if the circumstances were clearly indicated as the basis and assuming no material mistakes were made (or at least not mentioned), this could suggest a deliberate act based on known conditions, potentially validating it.

7. **(3, 5 | N)**: Here, "Materiality of Mistake" and "Gross Negligence Exception" are considered. If the mistake is material but resulted from gross negligence, without the other party's knowledge or shared mistake, this would likely invalidate the act due to the significant error caused by negligence.

8. **(2, 5 | N)**: Involving "Mistake Types" and "Gross Negligence Exception," if mistakes were made due to gross negligence, this typically disqualifies rescission, suggesting the act remains as is, but given the context of mistake types, it leans towards invalidation due to potential for significant error.

9. **(1, 5 | Y)**: This scenario considers "Manifestation of Intention" and "Gross Negligence Exception." If there's no mention of mistakes being material or not indicated as a basis, but gross negligence is discussed in the context of exceptions (other party knew, didn't know due to gross negligence, or shared mistake), this could imply specific conditions under which the act remains valid.

10. **(4, 6 | Y)**: Finally, with "Indication of Basis for Juridical Act" and "Effect on Third Parties," if circumstances were clearly indicated as the basis for the juridical act and considering that rescission may not be asserted against a third party in good faith without negligence, this suggests a level of transparency and fairness that could validate the act, especially from the perspective of protecting third-party interests.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determination of validity based on the conditions outlined in Article 95.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the query and the factors listed from Article 95, let's assess each factor in relation to the query.

1. **Manifestation of Intention**: The query involves a sales contract between person B and person C, which is a manifestation of intention. Therefore, (Query entails 1).
2. **Mistake Types**: Person C is mistaken regarding an essential element (ownership of real property L), which aligns with type (ii) holding an incorrect understanding of the circumstances. Hence, (Query entails 2).
3. **Materiality of Mistake**: The mistake about ownership is material in light of the purpose of the sales contract and common sense in transactions. Thus, (Query entails 3).
4. **Indication of Basis for Juridical Act**: The query doesn't explicitly mention if the circumstances (ownership) were indicated as the basis for the juridical act, but it implies that person C's mistake about ownership affects the contract. Therefore, we could argue (Query entails 4) based on the context provided.
5. **Gross Negligence Exception**: There is no information in the query suggesting gross negligence on the part of person C or any exception related to the other party's knowledge or shared mistake. So, (Query not entails 5).
6. **Effect on Third Parties**: The query does involve a third party (person A) who owns the property, but it doesn't discuss asserting rescission against them in good faith without negligence. Thus, (Query not entails 6).

### Task 2:
The query explicitly determines that the contract is "not effective," implying that due to person C's mistake regarding an essential element of the sales contract (ownership), person B bears no obligation to acquire ownership from person A and transfer it to person C. This implies that the juridical act (the sales contract between B and C) is legally invalid under these circumstances. Therefore, the answer is (Query Invalid).

(i) a mistake wherein the person lacks the intention that corresponds to the manifestation of intention; or
(ii) a mistake wherein the person making the manifestation of intention holds an understandings that does not correspond to the truth with regard to the circumstances which the person has taken as the basis for the juridical act.

 To evaluate the query's validity, we first need to factor the given article into its key components and then assess whether the query logically follows from these factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Existence of Statutory Lien**: The article establishes that a statutory lien for construction work on immovables exists.
2. **Connection to Construction Work**: This lien is specifically related to expenses incurred for construction work performed by a person who designs, constructs, or supervises the construction regarding the immovables of the obligor.
3. **Scope of the Lien**: The statutory liens exist with respect to the increased value of the immovables alone.
4. **Condition for the Lien**: There must be a current increase in the value of the immovables resulting from the construction work for the lien to apply.
5. **Specificity to Immovables**: The article is specifically concerned with immovables and the construction work performed on them.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we are asked to determine if a query is legally valid without providing the actual query, I will demonstrate how one might approach this task using the factored components:

- If the query pertains to the existence or conditions of statutory liens on immovables due to construction work expenses, and it aligns with the factors outlined (e.g., connection to increased value, specificity to immovables), then it would likely be considered valid (Y).
- Conversely, if the query introduces elements not covered by these factors (e.g., liens on movables, unrelated types of expenses), or contradicts them, it would be considered invalid (N).

Without a specific query to evaluate against the factored components, one can only speculate on its validity based on how closely it adheres to or diverges from the established legal principles outlined in Article 327.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 327, I'll generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The existence of a statutory lien and its connection to construction work expenses suggest that if these two conditions are met, the juridical act is legally valid because it directly aligns with the article's primary stipulations regarding the creation and basis of such liens.

2. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If the scope of the lien is respected (pertaining only to the increased value of immovables) and the process is specific to immovables, then the act is legally valid. This combination ensures adherence to the article's definitions and limitations regarding what the lien can cover.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The existence of a statutory lien coupled with the condition that there must be a current increase in the value of the immovables for the lien to apply directly fulfills two critical requirements outlined by the article. Thus, this scenario supports legal validity.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: When the connection to construction work and specificity to immovables are both present, it indicates that the lien is appropriately tied to the intended subject matter (immovables and related construction expenses), supporting its legal validity.

5. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although this scenario involves the scope of the lien and a condition for its application (increased value), without the establishment of the lien's existence or its connection to specific construction work on immovables, it lacks essential context for determining validity under Article 327.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of the existence of a statutory lien and its scope limited to the increased value of immovables directly addresses core aspects of what constitutes such a lien under Article 327, supporting its legal validity.

7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario links the lien to construction work expenses and requires an increase in the immovable's value, which are both fundamental to the article's stipulations for when and how such liens can be established, thus indicating legal validity.

8. (5 | N) 
Justification: Specificity to immovables alone is insufficient to determine the legal validity of a juridical act under Article 327 without reference to the existence, scope, or conditions of the statutory lien itself.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive scenario covers the existence of the lien, its connection to construction work expenses, and its limited scope to increased immovable value, thereby fulfilling all primary requirements outlined by Article 327 for legal validity.

10. (4 | N) 
Justification: The condition of an increase in value alone, without any reference to the existence of a statutory lien or its connection to specific construction work on immovables, does not provide enough context to establish legal validity under Article 327.

 To address the query regarding whether a given sentence logically follows from the provided legal articles, we must first factor the articles into their key components and then assess how these factors relate to the validity of the query.

1. **Eligibility for Assistance**: The family court can decide to commence assistance for a person with inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder.
2. **Requesters for Assistance**: Requests can be made by the person in question, their spouse, relatives within the fourth degree of kinship, guardians, supervisors of guardians, curators, supervisors of curators, or public prosecutors.
3. **Exception for Grounds in Article 7 or Main Clause of Article 11**: The assistance does not apply if grounds prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 exist.
4. **Commencement of Curatorship**: A curatorship can be commenced for a person with extremely inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder, with similar requesters as for assistance but excluding those with causes set forth in Article 7.
5. **Requesters for Curatorship**: Similar to assistance, requests for curatorship can be made by the person, their spouse, relatives within the fourth degree of kinship, guardians, supervisors of guardians, assistants, supervisors of assistants, or public prosecutors.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we have factored the articles into their core components, to determine if a query is legally valid, we would compare its elements against these factors. However, without a specific query provided for validation against the factored legal context, I will demonstrate how this process works with a hypothetical query:

- **Hypothetical Query**: Can a public prosecutor request assistance for someone whose capacity is inadequate due to a mental disorder?

To validate this query:
- It aligns with Factor 2 (Requesters for Assistance), which includes public prosecutors as eligible to make such requests.
- It does not conflict with Factors 3 or 4, assuming no grounds in Article 7 apply and the capacity issue is one of inadequacy rather than extreme inadequacy.

Therefore, based on the factors provided and without specific details that might invalidate it (such as grounds under Article 7), a query about a public prosecutor requesting assistance for someone with inadequate mental capacity would be considered valid within the context of these articles. 

However, since no actual query was provided to validate against the given legal articles, I will give a general response based on the process described:

Given that there's no specific query to evaluate against the factored components of the legal article, and following the instructions strictly which require an evaluation of a query to provide a "Y" or "N" answer:

Since no actual validation could be performed due to the lack of a specific query in your request, I'm constrained to not provide a direct "Y" or "N" without potentially misinterpreting the task. However, following the format requirement but acknowledging this limitation: 

The final answer is: $\boxed{N}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from the article, here are 10 case scenarios with their respective justifications:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The family court can decide to commence assistance for a person with inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder (Factor 1), and the request can be made by eligible individuals such as the person's spouse or relatives within the fourth degree of kinship (Factor 2). Since both conditions are met without conflicting with exceptions, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: If grounds prescribed in Article 7 exist (Factor 3), then according to the article, assistance cannot be commenced. Therefore, the presence of this factor alone renders the juridical act invalid.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A person has inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder (Factor 1), and there's a basis for commencing a curatorship due to extremely inadequate capacity (Factor 4). Since both conditions relate to different levels of capacity issues and do not directly conflict with each other or the exceptions, the act could be considered valid in contexts where assistance progresses to curatorship based on worsening conditions.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Requests for assistance can be made by various individuals (Factor 2), and similarly, requests for curatorship can also be made by a range of people including assistants and their supervisors (Factor 5). If a request is made within these parameters for someone whose capacity to appreciate their situation is inadequate or extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder, then the act is legally valid.

5. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: The presence of Factor 3 (grounds in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11) directly conflicts with the commencement of assistance for someone with inadequate capacity (Factor 1). Therefore, the juridical act is invalid due to the exceptions outlined.

6. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Both curatorship and its requesters are defined within these factors. If a person's capacity is extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder (Factor 4), and requests for such curatorships can be made by eligible individuals (Factor 5), then the act of commencing a curatorship is legally valid.

7. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Even if requests for assistance can be made by various eligible individuals (Factor 2), the existence of grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 (Factor 3) makes the commencement of assistance invalid.

8. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario combines the conditions for both assistance and curatorship with the eligible requesters. Since a person's capacity can evolve from inadequate to extremely inadequate, and requests can be made by eligible individuals for both scenarios, this combination does not inherently conflict with the article's provisions, making the juridical act valid.

9. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The presence of grounds in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 (Factor 3) prevents the commencement of curatorship, even if requests for it can be made by a range of individuals (Factor 5). Therefore, the act is invalid due to the specified exceptions.

10. (1, 2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A person has inadequate capacity (Factor 1), and various individuals can request assistance (Factor 2). Additionally, requests for curatorship, which might become necessary if the person's condition worsens, can be made by a range of people (Factor 5). Since these factors do not conflict with each other or the exceptions provided, the juridical act is considered valid.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the given query directly against the factored components of the legal article:

**Query:** The family court may decide to commence an assistance also in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder.

**Assessment against factors:**

1. **Eligibility for Assistance**: This factor is about commencing assistance for someone with inadequate capacity, not specifically "extremely inadequate" as the query suggests.
2. **Requesters for Assistance**: The query does not specify who is making the request, so it doesn't directly relate to this factor.
3. **Exception for Grounds in Article 7 or Main Clause of Article 11**: This factor involves exceptions based on other articles and does not directly address the capacity level mentioned in the query.
4. **Commencement of Curatorship**: This factor is about curatorship for those with "extremely inadequate" capacity, which aligns with the query's description but pertains to curatorship, not assistance.
5. **Requesters for Curatorship**: Similar to Factor 2, this doesn't directly relate to the query since it specifies requesters for curatorship.

**Task 1 Response:**
(Query entails 4) because the query mentions a condition ("extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder") that aligns with the criteria for commencement of curatorship as described in factor 4, even though the query itself refers to "assistance."

**Task 2 Response:**
Since the legal articles provided distinguish between assistance for those with inadequate capacity and curatorship for those with extremely inadequate capacity, and given that the query seems to conflate these by suggesting assistance for someone whose condition would typically warrant a curatorship:
(Query Invalid) 

This is because the query suggests that assistance can be commenced for someone with "extremely inadequate" capacity due to a mental disorder, which contradicts the provided legal framework where such cases are subject to curatorship (as per Article 11), not assistance.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement given the context of Article 15, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then assess whether the query aligns with these factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Eligibility for Assistance**: The family court can decide to commence assistance for a person with inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder.
2. **Requesters of Assistance**: Assistance can be requested by the person in question, their spouse, relatives within the fourth degree of kinship, guardian, guardian's supervisor, curator, curator's supervisor, or a public prosecutor.
3. **Exclusion Criteria**: The article does not apply to persons with grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11.
4. **Consent Requirement**: For requests made by someone other than the person in question, consent from the person in question is required for the commencement of assistance.
5. **Decision-Making Authority**: The family court has the authority to decide on the commencement of assistance.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, to determine if a query is legally valid within the context of Article 15, we would need to assess whether it respects the eligibility criteria, the requester's qualifications, the exclusion criteria, the consent requirement, and the decision-making authority outlined in the article.

However, without a specific query provided, I will demonstrate how this analysis could be applied:

- **Hypothetical Query**: "Can a public prosecutor request assistance for someone without their consent if that person has a mental disorder?"
  
  Analysis:
  - This query involves factors 2 (Requesters of Assistance), 4 (Consent Requirement), and 1 (Eligibility for Assistance).
  - According to factor 2, a public prosecutor can indeed request such assistance.
  - Factor 4 indicates that consent from the person in question is required if the request is made by someone other than the person themselves, which would apply here since the request is made by a public prosecutor.
  
  Conclusion: The query touches on relevant factors but seems to misunderstand or overlook the consent requirement (factor 4), making it potentially invalid based on the information provided in Article 15. However, without directly stating the outcome of such a scenario (i.e., whether the court can override the lack of consent under specific circumstances not detailed in the article), we must consider the explicit requirements stated.

Given this analysis framework and the absence of a specific query to evaluate against Article 15's factors, I would need the actual query to provide a definitive "Y" or "N" answer regarding its legal validity within the context provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 15, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: A person with a mental disorder requests assistance from the family court, which is within their eligibility for assistance (factor 1). As the person in question is making the request themselves, it falls under the category of requesters of assistance (factor 2), and thus, the act is legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: A public prosecutor attempts to commence assistance for a person who has grounds as prescribed in Article 7, which directly triggers the exclusion criteria (factor 3). Despite the family court's authority to decide on assistance (factor 5), the exclusion criteria take precedence, making the act invalid.

3. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A spouse requests assistance for their partner with a mental disorder, fitting the requester category (factor 2). The person in question provides consent for this request, satisfying the consent requirement (factor 4), thus the act is legally valid.

4. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: A person without adequate capacity due to a mental disorder is considered for assistance (factor 1), but they have grounds as prescribed in Article 7 (factor 3). The exclusion criteria supersede the eligibility for assistance, making the act invalid.

5. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The family court decides on assistance for a person with a mental disorder after obtaining their consent (factor 4), exercising its decision-making authority (factor 5). Since both conditions are met appropriately, the act is legally valid.

6. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: A guardian requests assistance for their ward who has grounds as prescribed in Article 11's main clause (factor 3), attempting to act within their role as a requester (factor 2). However, the exclusion criteria apply, rendering the request invalid despite the guardian's standing as a valid requester.

7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A person with inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder gives consent for assistance (factor 4), and they are eligible for such assistance (factor 1). Since both eligibility and consent are established, the act is legally valid.

8. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: An attempt is made to assist someone who falls under the exclusion criteria (factor 3), but with their consent (factor 4). Despite the presence of consent, the exclusion criteria make the act invalid because it overrides the consent factor in this context.

9. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A public prosecutor requests assistance for a person with a mental disorder (factor 2), and the family court decides on the commencement of assistance (factor 5). Given that both the request and decision-making processes are properly followed without mentioning exclusion criteria or lack of consent, the act is legally valid.

10. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: A relative within the fourth degree of kinship requests assistance for a person with a mental disorder who has grounds as prescribed in Article 7 (factor 3), attempting to help someone eligible for assistance (factor 1) and acting as a valid requester (factor 2). However, the presence of exclusion criteria (factor 3) makes the act invalid despite fulfilling other conditions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To evaluate the query's validity, let's first factor the given article into its components.


### Begin Factoring
1. The family court must rescind the decision for commencement of assistance under certain conditions.
2. The conditions for rescission include the cessation of grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1).
3. Requests for rescission can be made by specific individuals, including the person in question, their spouse, relatives within the fourth degree of kinship, the guardian or supervisor of a minor, the assistant or their supervisor, or a public prosecutor.
4. The family court may rescind all or part of the decision at the request of eligible persons.
5. The decision subject to rescission is related to the commencement of assistance as decided by the family court.
### End of Factoring


<Number of factors : 5>

Given that there's no specific query provided to evaluate against these factors, I will demonstrate how one might assess a hypothetical query:

Hypothetical Query: "Can anyone request the rescission of the decision for commencement of assistance?"

To determine if this query is valid within the context of the article, we examine the factors. Specifically, factor 3 indicates that requests can be made by specific individuals, not just anyone. Thus, based on the information provided in the article:

- If the query implies that "anyone" can request rescission without specifying eligible persons as outlined in the article, it would not logically follow the legal context provided.
- However, if the query is asking about the possibility of requesting a rescission under the conditions and by the individuals specified, then it aligns with the factors extracted from the article.

Given no actual query to assess directly against these factors, I'll proceed based on the requirement for a hypothetical assessment:

Since the hypothetical query touches on the eligibility of who can make requests (factor 3), but does not specify alignment with the conditions or eligible persons as outlined in the article, and without direct evidence linking it to the specific conditions under which rescission is allowed (factors 2 and 4), one might argue that there's insufficient information to validate it fully against the legal context provided. Therefore, without a clear query to assess and based on the hypothetical example given:

The final answer is: $\boxed{N}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the article and its factors, here are 10 unique case scenarios with their respective justifications:

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The family court must rescind the decision for commencement of assistance when the grounds cease to exist (factor 1), and this is directly tied to the conditions prescribed in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1) (factor 2). Thus, if both conditions are met, the act is legally valid.

2. (3 | N)
Justification: Even though a request can be made by specific individuals (factor 3), without the cessation of grounds or the involvement of the family court's decision-making process, the request alone does not ensure the legal validity of rescinding the decision.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The family court's decision to rescind all or part of the commencement of assistance (factor 4) at the request of eligible persons, coupled with the condition that the grounds for assistance have ceased to exist (factor 1), makes the juridical act legally valid.

4. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: The decision subject to rescission being related to the commencement of assistance as decided by the family court (factor 5), and the cessation of grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1) (factor 2), together provide a clear legal basis for the validity of the act.

5. (3, 5 | N)
Justification: While specific individuals can request rescission (factor 3), and the decision is about commencement of assistance (factor 5), without the family court's involvement or the cessation of grounds, the act lacks critical elements to be considered legally valid.

6. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This combination includes all necessary elements for a legally valid act: the family court must rescind (factor 1), the grounds have ceased to exist (factor 2), and eligible individuals are making the request (factor 3).

7. (4 | N)
Justification: The family court may rescind all or part of the decision at the request of eligible persons (factor 4), but without the underlying conditions being met (cessation of grounds, involvement of the family court), this factor alone does not ensure legal validity.

8. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The cessation of grounds (factor 2) combined with a request from eligible individuals (factor 3) provides a basis for the legal validity of rescinding the decision, as it aligns with the prerequisites outlined in the article.

9. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: The family court's role in rescinding the decision (factor 1) and the nature of the decision being about commencement of assistance (factor 5) together support the legal validity of the act, given that these are fundamental aspects of the process outlined in the article.

10. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: Even though eligible individuals can request rescission (factor 3), and the family court may rescind all or part of the decision (factor 4), without the cessation of grounds or the direct involvement of the family court's decision-making process as primary factors, the act lacks critical legal underpinnings to be considered valid.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors, leading to a determinate verdict based on the article's stipulations.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address both tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the query "If the grounds of commencement of assistance cease to exist, the family court may rescind the decision for commencement of assistance without any party's request," let's assess whether it entails each factor:

1. **The family court must rescind the decision for commencement of assistance under certain conditions.**
   - (Query entails 1) because it discusses the condition under which the family court may rescind the decision.

2. **The conditions for rescission include the cessation of grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1).**
   - (Query entails 2) as it mentions the cessation of grounds for commencement of assistance, aligning with the concept of cessation of prescribed grounds.

3. **Requests for rescission can be made by specific individuals, including the person in question, their spouse, relatives within the fourth degree of kinship, the guardian or supervisor of a minor, the assistant or their supervisor, or a public prosecutor.**
   - (Query does not entail 3) because it suggests the family court may rescind without any party's request, which contradicts the factor about specific individuals making requests.

4. **The family court may rescind all or part of the decision at the request of eligible persons.**
   - (Query does not entail 4) since it implies rescission can occur without a request from eligible persons, differing from this factor.

5. **The decision subject to rescission is related to the commencement of assistance as decided by the family court.**
   - (Query entails 5) because it talks about rescinding the decision for commencement of assistance.

### Task 2:
To determine if the query is valid or invalid based on the legal context provided:

The query suggests that the family court "may rescind the decision for commencement of assistance without any party's request" if the grounds cease to exist. However, Article 18(1) states that the family court "must rescind the decision" at the request of specific individuals when the grounds cease to exist, not necessarily without any request. This distinction makes the query's premise about rescission without a request not entirely aligned with the article's stipulations.

Given this analysis:

**(Query Invalid)** because it implies a condition (rescission without any party's request) that is not supported by the provided legal text, which requires a request from specific individuals for the rescission to occur.

 To determine whether a given query is legally valid within the context of Article 17, we must first factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors interact with the query in question. 

### Begin Factoring
1. **Request for Consent**: The family court may decide that a person under assistance must obtain their assistant's consent to perform specific juridical acts at the request of the person, their assistant, or the assistant's supervisor.
2. **Restriction on Acts**: The acts requiring consent are limited to a part of those listed in Article 13, paragraph (1).
3. **Requirement for Consent from Person in Question**: For decisions made at the request of someone other than the person under assistance, the consent of the person in question is required.
4. **Permission in Lieu of Consent**: If an assistant does not consent to an act that is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance, the family court may grant permission in lieu of the assistant's consent at the request of the person under assistance.
5. **Specific Juridical Acts**: The article implies that not all juridical acts are subject to the requirement for the assistant's consent but only those specified by the court decision based on Article 13, paragraph (1).
6. **Protection of Interests**: The mechanism of requiring consent or granting permission is designed to protect the interests of the person under assistance.
### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 6>

Given these factors and without a specific query provided in your question, I'll demonstrate how one might approach validating a query against Article 17. Let's consider a hypothetical query:

- Query: "The family court can grant permission for a juridical act without the assistant's consent if it doesn't harm the person under assistance."

This query would be considered valid (Y) because it aligns with factor 4, which states that the family court may grant permission in lieu of the assistant's consent if the act is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance.

However, without a specific query provided in your prompt, I've illustrated how to approach the validation process based on the factors extracted from Article 17. If you provide a specific query related to Article 17, I can offer a more direct assessment of its validity within the context of the article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 17, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The family court decides that a person under assistance must obtain their assistant's consent for specific juridical acts at the request of the person or their assistant, and these acts are restricted to those listed in Article 13, paragraph (1). Since both the request for consent and the restriction on acts are met, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: A decision is made at the request of someone other than the person under assistance without their consent, and it involves a specific juridical act not specified by the court decision based on Article 13, paragraph (1). The lack of consent from the person in question and the act not being specifically authorized makes the juridical act invalid.

3. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The assistant does not consent to an act that is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance, but the family court grants permission in lieu of the assistant's consent at the request of the person under assistance. This directly aligns with factor 4, making the juridical act legally valid.

4. (1, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The family court decides that a person under assistance must obtain their assistant's consent to perform specific juridical acts, and this mechanism is designed to protect the interests of the person under assistance. Since both factors are present and aligned with the purpose of Article 17, the juridical act is legally valid.

5. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: The acts requiring consent are limited, but a decision is made at the request of someone other than the person under assistance without their consent. This combination violates the requirement for consent from the person in question, making the juridical act invalid.

6. (5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: A specific juridical act is subject to the requirement for the assistant's consent as specified by the court decision based on Article 13, paragraph (1), and this mechanism protects the interests of the person under assistance. Since both factors align with the protective purpose of Article 17, the juridical act is legally valid.

7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The family court decides that a person under assistance must obtain their assistant's consent for specific juridical acts, and when the assistant does not consent to an act unlikely to prejudice the person under assistance, the court grants permission in lieu of consent. This scenario directly follows from the factors, making the juridical act legally valid.

8. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: A decision is made at the request of someone other than the person under assistance without their consent, and although the family court can grant permission in lieu of the assistant's consent for acts unlikely to prejudice the person under assistance, the initial lack of consent from the person in question renders the juridical act invalid.

9. (2, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The acts requiring consent are restricted to those listed in Article 13, paragraph (1), and this restriction is part of the mechanism designed to protect the interests of the person under assistance. Since both factors are present and contribute to the protective purpose, the juridical act is legally valid.

10. (1, 5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The family court decides that a person under assistance must obtain their assistant's consent for specific juridical acts, these acts are specified by the court decision based on Article 13, paragraph (1), and this mechanism protects the interests of the person under assistance. With all factors aligning with the article's intent and requirements, the juridical act is legally valid.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors from Article 17, leading to a determinate verdict on the legal validity of the juridical act in question.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1
The query mentions "the assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent," which directly relates to the concept of requesting consent for specific juridical acts as outlined in factor 1. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2
The query does not explicitly mention the restriction of acts to those listed in Article 13, paragraph (1), but it implies a specific act that requires consent. However, without direct reference to Article 13, paragraph (1), we cannot conclusively say it entails factor 2 based on the information given. Thus, (Query not entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3
The query is about the family court granting permission at the request of the person under assistance when the assistant does not consent, which does not directly involve the requirement for consent from the person in question when the decision is made at the request of someone else. Therefore, (Query not entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4
The query explicitly mentions that "the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the assistant's consent, at the request of the person under assistance," if the act is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance. This directly aligns with factor 4. Hence, (Query entails 4).

## Step 5: Assessing Factor 5
The query implies that not all juridical acts are subject to the requirement for the assistant's consent but only those specified by the court decision based on the context provided. However, it does not explicitly state this principle as a general rule for all cases under Article 17. So, (Query not entails 5).

## Step 6: Assessing Factor 6
The query is about protecting the interests of the person under assistance by allowing the family court to grant permission for an act when the assistant's consent is not given, but the act does not harm the person under assistance. This aligns with the protection of interests principle. Therefore, (Query entails 6).

## Step 7: Determining Query Validity
The query describes a scenario where the family court may grant permission in lieu of the assistant's consent under specific conditions, which is a legally valid procedure according to Article 17. Thus, (Query Valid).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to Article 35, let's first break down the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Formation Restriction**: The formation of foreign juridical persons in Japan is restricted, excluding states, administrative divisions of states, and commercial companies.
2. **Exception for Law or Treaty**: This restriction does not apply if a law or treaty permits the formation of such foreign juridical persons.
3. **Equal Private Rights**: A permitted foreign juridical person has the same private rights as a domestically formed juridical person of the same kind.
4. **Limitation on Rights**: The equal private rights do not include rights that a foreign national is not entitled to enjoy, or rights with special provisions in a law or treaty.
5. **Specific Exclusions**: States, administrative divisions of states, and commercial companies are excluded from the general restriction on forming foreign juridical persons.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we can now evaluate any query regarding Article 35 by checking if it aligns with or contradicts these established points. However, without a specific query provided to assess against Article 35, I'll illustrate how one might approach this task using a hypothetical query:

- Hypothetical Query: "A foreign juridical person permitted under Japanese law has all the rights of a domestic juridical person without any exceptions."

To determine if this query is legally valid within the context of Article 35:
- Factor 3 supports the idea that a permitted foreign juridical person has equal private rights to those of a domestic juridical person.
- However, Factor 4 introduces an exception, stating that not all rights are equally available, especially those a foreign national cannot enjoy or those with special provisions in laws or treaties.

Given this analysis, the query seems to overlook the exceptions mentioned in Factor 4. Thus, it does not entirely align with Article 35's stipulations, making the response "N" because the query ignores specific limitations on the rights of foreign juridical persons outlined in the article.

In summary, when evaluating queries against Article 35 or similar legal texts, it's crucial to consider all relevant factors and exceptions to determine legal validity accurately.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 35, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: The formation of a foreign juridical person is restricted (Factor 1), and even if it were permitted, having equal private rights (Factor 3) does not automatically make the act legally valid without considering exceptions or specific laws/treaties allowing its formation.

2. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: If a law or treaty permits the formation of a foreign juridical person (Factor 2), and it is one of the excluded types like states, administrative divisions of states, or commercial companies (Factor 5), then the act can be considered legally valid because these entities are explicitly exempt from the general restriction.

3. (1, 4 | N)
Justification: The presence of formation restrictions (Factor 1) combined with limitations on rights (Factor 4) suggests that not all foreign juridical persons would have unfettered access to private rights, making an act attempting to assert such rights without consideration of these limitations legally invalid.

4. (3 | Y)
Justification: If a foreign juridical person is permitted and thus has the same private rights as a domestic one (Factor 3), then in the absence of any mentioned exceptions or restrictions, the act related to exercising these rights can be considered legally valid.

5. (2, 4 | N)
Justification: Even if a law or treaty permits a foreign juridical person's formation (Factor 2), the presence of limitations on certain rights (Factor 4) means that not all acts by such an entity would be legally valid, especially those attempting to exercise restricted rights.

6. (5 | Y)
Justification: If the foreign juridical person is one of the explicitly excluded types like states, administrative divisions of states, or commercial companies (Factor 5), then its formation and related acts can be considered legally valid due to this exemption.

7. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: In a scenario where the formation of a foreign juridical person is restricted (Factor 1) but permitted by a law or treaty (Factor 2), and it has equal private rights (Factor 3), then acts related to its establishment and operation can be legally valid, assuming compliance with all stipulated conditions.

8. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: The combination of limitations on certain rights (Factor 4) for a foreign juridical person that is one of the excluded types (Factor 5) indicates that while formation might be permissible, attempts to exercise restricted rights would still be legally invalid.

9. (2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: If a law or treaty permits the formation (Factor 2), the entity has equal private rights (Factor 3), and despite limitations on certain rights (Factor 4), the entity operates within these defined boundaries, then its acts can be considered legally valid.

10. (1, 2, 4 | N)
Justification: The presence of general restrictions on formation (Factor 1), permission by law or treaty (Factor 2), and limitations on certain rights (Factor 4) together suggest that while formation might be allowed under specific circumstances, the exercise of restricted rights would not be legally valid without further specification or exemption.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to Article 95, we first need to factor the article into its core components or factors. 

### Begin Factoring
1. **Manifestation of Intention**: The article discusses a manifestation of intention, which is a fundamental concept in legal transactions.
2. **Voidability**: It mentions that such a manifestation can be voidable under certain conditions.
3. **Mistake as a Ground for Voidability**: Specifically, it identifies mistakes as grounds for voidability.
4. **Materiality of the Mistake**: The mistake must be material in light of the purpose of the juridical act and common sense in transactions.
5. **Types of Mistakes**:
   - (i) Lack of corresponding intention to the manifestation.
   - (ii) Holding an understanding not corresponding to the truth regarding circumstances taken as the basis for the juridical act.
6. **Purpose of the Juridical Act**: The purpose is a crucial factor in determining materiality.
7. **Common Sense in Transactions**: Common sense is also a benchmark for evaluating the materiality of mistakes.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 7>

Given that we are to evaluate the legal validity of a query but no specific query was provided to assess against Article 95, let's create a hypothetical query for illustrative purposes: "A contract is voidable if one party misunderstands the terms due to a linguistic error."

To determine if this hypothetical query is legally valid with the context of Article 95:

- The article specifies that a manifestation of intention can be voidable if based on mistakes that are material. 
- It details two types of mistakes: lacking the corresponding intention or holding an incorrect understanding of circumstances.
- The query about a contract being voidable due to a linguistic error (which could lead to one party misunderstanding the terms) touches on the idea of a mistake affecting the manifestation of intention.

However, Article 95 specifically mentions mistakes related to the lack of corresponding intention or incorrect understanding of circumstances. A linguistic error might not directly fit into these categories unless it significantly impacts the purpose of the juridical act or common sense in transactions, making the mistake material.

Therefore, without a direct and specific query provided and considering the hypothetical example, if we strictly interpret Article 95, the answer could lean towards "N" because the article does not explicitly mention linguistic errors as a ground for voidability. Nonetheless, this conclusion depends heavily on how one interprets "circumstances" and "common sense in transactions," which could potentially encompass misunderstandings arising from linguistic errors if they are deemed material to the transaction's purpose.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 95, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention (factor 1) that is voidable (factor 2) due to a material mistake (factor 4) regarding the purpose of the juridical act or common sense in transactions would still be considered legally valid initially until the voidability condition is met.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: If a mistake (factor 3) occurs and it falls under one of the types of mistakes (factor 5), specifically lacking corresponding intention or incorrect understanding of circumstances, without considering materiality or purpose, the juridical act could be deemed invalid.

3. (1, 6 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention (factor 1) made with a clear understanding of the purpose of the juridical act (factor 6) would generally be considered legally valid, as it aligns with the intent and objectives of the transaction.

4. (2, 7 | N) 
Justification: If a manifestation is voidable (factor 2) due to not meeting common sense in transactions (factor 7), this implies that the act does not align with reasonable expectations, potentially rendering it invalid.

5. (3, 6 | Y) 
Justification: A mistake (factor 3) made with regard to the purpose of the juridical act (factor 6) could still result in a legally valid transaction if the mistake is not material or does not fundamentally alter the intention behind the act.

6. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: If a material mistake (factor 4) occurs and it involves either type of mistake (factor 5), specifically lacking corresponding intention or an incorrect understanding of circumstances, this would likely invalidate the juridical act due to its material impact on the transaction.

7. (1, 3, 7 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention (factor 1) involving a mistake (factor 3) but still aligning with common sense in transactions (factor 7) would likely be considered legally valid, as it reflects an understanding of reasonable transactional norms.

8. (2, 5, 6 | N) 
Justification: A voidable manifestation (factor 2) based on one of the specified types of mistakes (factor 5), and related to the purpose of the juridical act (factor 6), would likely be invalid because it directly impacts the foundational intent and objectives of the transaction.

9. (4, 6, 7 | Y) 
Justification: If a material mistake (factor 4) is considered in light of the purpose of the juridical act (factor 6) and common sense in transactions (factor 7), but does not fundamentally alter the transaction's validity or intent, the act could still be deemed legally valid.

10. (1, 2, 3, 5 | N) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention (factor 1) that is voidable (factor 2) due to a mistake (factor 3), and this mistake falls under one of the specified types (factor 5), would likely render the juridical act invalid because it directly affects the validity and intent of the transaction, considering all these factors together indicate a significant issue with the formation or execution of the act.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the given article, let's first factor the provided legal article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Voidable Acts**: The article discusses acts that are voidable under certain conditions.
2. **Qualified Legal Capacity to Act**: One condition for an act being voidable is if it was performed by someone with limited legal capacity to act.
3. **Mistake, Fraud, or Duress**: Another condition for an act being voidable is if it was made under mistake, fraud, or duress.
4. **Right to Rescind**: The right to rescind (or cancel) a voidable act is specified, depending on the grounds of its voidability.
5. **Persons Authorized to Rescind**: Specifically, who can rescind an act: the person with qualified legal capacity, their agent, successor, or someone authorized to give consent.
6. **Defective Manifestation of Intention**: Acts resulting from a defective manifestation of intention (due to mistake, fraud, or duress) can only be rescinded by the person who made that manifestation or their agent/successor.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 6

Given these factors, we need a query to assess its legal validity against the context provided. However, since no specific query is provided in your prompt, I'll create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes:

Query: Can an act voidable due to mistake be rescinded by anyone other than the person who made the defective manifestation of intention?

To answer this query based on the factored article:
- The article specifies that acts voidable due to mistake (among other reasons) can only be rescinded by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or their agent/successor (Factor 6).
- There's no provision for "anyone" else to rescind such an act, indicating a specific legal procedure and authorization requirement (Factors 4 and 5).

Thus, based on the factors extracted from the article, the answer to whether the query is legally valid would be "N" because the query seems to imply a broader allowance for rescission than what the article actually permits. The article restricts who can rescind an act voidable due to mistake to the person who made the defective manifestation or their agent/successor, not "anyone."
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 120, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: An act that is voidable due to qualified legal capacity to act can be rescinded by the person with qualified legal capacity or their agent/successor, making the juridical act initially valid but subject to potential rescission.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: If an act was made under mistake, fraud, or duress without any consideration of qualified legal capacity or right to rescind, it's likely that the act is invalid due to the lack of proper intention or consent.

3. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: When there's a clear right to rescind an act and specified persons authorized to do so, the juridical act can be considered valid because it provides a legal framework for addressing issues related to the act's validity.

4. (1, 6 | N) 
Justification: If an act is voidable due to both qualified legal capacity and defective manifestation of intention but lacks clarity on who can rescind it or under what conditions, the act might be considered invalid due to ambiguity in its execution and potential for challenge.

5. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: An act performed by someone with limited legal capacity under mistake, fraud, or duress could still be valid if the person with qualified legal capacity or their agent/successor can rescind it, providing a pathway to correct the situation.

6. (4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: When there's a clear right to rescind an act due to defective manifestation of intention and specifications on who can exercise this right, the juridical act is likely valid because it adheres to legal principles regarding consent and correction of errors.

7. (1, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If an act is voidable on grounds of qualified legal capacity, mistake, fraud, or duress, and there are persons authorized to rescind it, the act could initially be considered valid due to the presence of a legal mechanism for addressing its potential flaws.

8. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: An act performed by someone with limited legal capacity without a clear right to rescind or specified persons authorized to do so might be invalid because it lacks a legal basis for correction or validation.

9. (3, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Acts voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress that result from a defective manifestation of intention can be valid if there's a clear pathway for rescission by the person who made the defective manifestation or their agent/successor.

10. (1, 2, 4, 5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: When all conditions regarding voidable acts, qualified legal capacity, right to rescind, persons authorized to rescind, and defective manifestation of intention are met, the juridical act is likely valid because it comprehensively addresses potential issues with its validity and provides a framework for correction.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1:

Given the query: "If an act that may be rescinded by a person (A) who made the defective manifestation of intention on the ground of A's mistake, the act is also voidable by the counterparty (B)."

Assessing against each factor:
1. **Voidable Acts**: The query mentions an act being voidable, so it entails Factor 1.
2. **Qualified Legal Capacity to Act**: There's no mention of limited legal capacity, so it does not entail Factor 2.
3. **Mistake, Fraud, or Duress**: The query specifically mentions "mistake," which is one of the grounds for an act being voidable, so it entails Factor 3.
4. **Right to Rescind**: The query discusses rescission by a person who made a defective manifestation of intention and implies another party (counterparty) can also make the act voidable, touching on the right to rescind, so it entails Factor 4.
5. **Persons Authorized to Rescind**: It suggests that not just the person with qualified legal capacity or their agent/successor but also a counterparty can affect the act's validity, which touches on who can rescind, so it entails Factor 5.
6. **Defective Manifestation of Intention**: The query directly mentions "defective manifestation of intention" due to mistake, so it entails Factor 6.

Thus, the output for Task 1 is:
- (Query entails 1)
- (Query does not entail 2)
- (Query entails 3)
- (Query entails 4)
- (Query entails 5)
- (Query entails 6)

### Task 2:

Given the query: "If an act that may be rescinded by a person (A) who made the defective manifestation of intention on the ground of A's mistake, the act is also voidable by the counterparty (B)."

The query suggests that an act can be considered voidable not just by the person who made the defective manifestation due to mistake but also implies the counterparty has a role in making the act voidable. However, according to Article 120(2), an act voidable on the grounds of a mistake can only be rescinded by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention or their agent/successor. The query's implication that a counterparty (B) can also make the act voidable does not align with the article's stipulation.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the strict interpretation of Article 120(2), the query seems to suggest an action (voidability by a counterparty) that is not explicitly supported by the article. Hence, from a legal validity standpoint regarding who can rescind an act due to mistake:

The answer for Task 2 is: "(Query Invalid)"

And then provide the answer (Y or N) along with my reasoning.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on Article 121-2, we first need to identify the key factors within this article. The factors can be summarized as follows:

1. **Receipt of Payment or Delivery**: A person has received payment or delivery.
2. **Void Act**: The act upon which the obligation is based is void.
3. **Voidable Act**: The act upon which the obligation is based is voidable.
4. **Gratuitous Act**: The act is a gratuitous one (given without expectation of payment).
5. **Knowledge of Voidness at Time of Receipt**: The person receiving the payment or delivery knew (or did not know) that the act was void at the time of receipt.
6. **Current Enrichment**: The person is currently enriched by the act.

Given these factors, here are 10 unique case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | N) - Receipt of payment based on a void act renders the obligation invalid because the act itself has no legal standing.

2. (3, 4 | Y) - If an act is gratuitous and voidable but the recipient did not know it was voidable at the time of receipt, they are only obligated to return to the extent they are currently enriched, suggesting some level of validity in their obligation to restore.

3. (1, 5 | N) - Knowing receipt of payment from a void act does not validate the juridical act; thus, it remains invalid.

4. (2, 6 | Y) - Even if an act is void, if the recipient is currently enriched by it, there's an obligation to return the enrichment, indicating some level of legal validity in the context of restitution.

5. (4, 6 | Y) - A gratuitous act that results in current enrichment implies a level of legal validity regarding the obligation to return the enrichment.

6. (3, 5 | N) - If an act is voidable and the recipient knew it was voidable at the time of receipt, the juridical act's validity is compromised.

7. (1, 4, 6 | Y) - Receipt of payment from a gratuitous act where the recipient is currently enriched suggests some legal validity in terms of obligations to restore.

8. (2, 3, 5 | N) - Knowledge of an act being void or voidable at the time of receipt does not validate an otherwise invalid juridical act based on a void act.

9. (1, 2, 6 | Y) - Even if an act is void and payment was received, the obligation to return to the extent currently enriched suggests some level of legal validity in terms of restitution obligations.

10. (4, 5, 6 | Y) - A gratuitous act where the recipient did not know it was voidable at the time but is currently enriched implies an obligation to return the enrichment, indicating some level of legal validity in the context of restitution.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and their implications for the legal validity of the juridical act or obligations based on Article 121-2.

 ### Begin Factoring
1. A gift without burden was rescinded on the ground of a mistake by the donor (A).
2. The donee (B) had already received the payment or delivery based on the gift contract.
3. B did not know at the time of receiving the payment or delivery that the gift contract was voidable.
4. B has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched.

### End of Factoring

Based on Article 121-2, specifically paragraph (2), it is stated that if a person receives payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void gratuitous act and did not know that the act was void at the time of receiving (or voidable in cases deemed void ab initio after receipt), they have an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched by the act.

Given this, we can assess the query against the factors:

- The query entails 1 because it mentions a gift being rescinded due to a mistake, which aligns with the concept of a void or voidable act.
- The query entails 2 as it states that B had already received payment or delivery based on the gift contract.
- The query entails 3 since it specifies that B did not know the gift contract was voidable at the time of receiving the payment or delivery.
- The query entails 4 because it concludes with B having an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched.

Considering these points, the query aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 121-2(2) for determining the obligation to restore or return based on a void or voidable act. Therefore, regarding Task 1, all factors are entailed by the query.

For Task 2, since the query concludes that B has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched, it implies that the juridical act (or obligation) in question is legally valid under the specific conditions described. Thus, the query does not determine the juridical acts or obligations as legally invalid but rather specifies a condition under which they are considered valid with certain obligations.

**Answer:** (Query Valid) 

Reasoning: The query outlines a scenario where, despite the gift being rescinded due to a mistake (making it voidable), the donee's lack of knowledge about the contract's status at the time of receipt and their current enrichment level dictate their obligation to return. This directly applies the principles from Article 121-2(2), indicating that under these specific conditions, the juridical act or obligation is considered valid with the stipulated obligations for restitution.

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to Article 95, we must first factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Manifestation of Intention**: The article discusses the conditions under which a manifestation of intention can be considered voidable.
2. **Mistake Types**: There are two types of mistakes that can render a manifestation of intention voidable: (i) lacking the corresponding intention, and (ii) holding an understanding not corresponding to the truth about the circumstances basis for the juridical act.
3. **Materiality of Mistake**: The mistake must be material in light of the purpose of the juridical act and common sense in the transaction.
4. **Rescission Conditions**: For mistakes under item (ii), rescission is only possible if it was indicated that the circumstances were taken as the basis for the juridical act.
5. **Gross Negligence Exception**: If a mistake is due to gross negligence, rescission is generally not allowed, except in cases where the other party knew or should have known of the mistake, or both parties were under the same mistake.
6. **Knowledge of Mistake by Other Party**: The knowledge or gross negligence regarding the mistake by the other party can affect the right to rescind a manifestation of intention.
7. **Mutual Mistake**: If both parties are under the same mistake, this can be grounds for rescission despite gross negligence.

### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 7


Given that there is no specific query provided to evaluate against Article 95, I will create a hypothetical query to demonstrate how one might assess its legal validity based on the factored components:

Hypothetical Query: "A person can rescind a contract if they were mistaken about a critical fact and indicated this was a basis for their agreement, regardless of whether the other party knew about the mistake."

To evaluate this query:
- The query involves **Manifestation of Intention** (Factor 1) and **Mistake Types**, specifically type (ii) (Factor 2).
- It touches on **Materiality of Mistake** (Factor 3), as it implies the mistake was critical.
- The query mentions indicating that circumstances were a basis for the juridical act, aligning with **Rescission Conditions** (Factor 4).
- However, it does not explicitly address **Gross Negligence Exception** (Factor 5) or **Knowledge of Mistake by Other Party** (Factor 6), which are crucial for determining the validity of rescission in cases of mistake.
- The query also doesn't directly reference **Mutual Mistake** (Factor 7).

Considering these factors, the hypothetical query seems to align with some aspects of Article 95 but lacks specificity regarding gross negligence and the other party's knowledge or mutual mistake. Therefore, without additional context about these critical factors, the query could be seen as partially valid but incomplete in its consideration of all relevant conditions under Article 95.


Since there is no actual query provided for a definitive assessment, I will give a generalized response based on the hypothetical analysis: **Y**, with the caveat that the actual validity would depend on how fully the query aligns with all factors outlined in Article 95.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the 10 case scenarios based on the factors from Article 95, we'll consider combinations of these factors to determine whether a juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N). The factors are:

1. **Manifestation of Intention**
2. **Mistake Types**
3. **Materiality of Mistake**
4. **Rescission Conditions**
5. **Gross Negligence Exception**
6. **Knowledge of Mistake by Other Party**
7. **Mutual Mistake**

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | Y) - A person manifests an intention but lacks the corresponding intention due to a mistake about their understanding of the circumstances. This scenario involves **Manifestation of Intention** and **Mistake Types**, making the juridical act voidable under Article 95.

2. (3, 4 | N) - A mistake is not material in light of the purpose of the juridical act, but it was indicated that certain circumstances were taken as the basis for the act. Since the mistake isn't material (**Materiality of Mistake**), and despite meeting **Rescission Conditions**, the act remains valid.

3. (2, 5 | N) - A person makes a mistake due to gross negligence about their intention corresponding to the manifestation. However, because it involves **Gross Negligence Exception**, they generally cannot rescind the manifestation, making the act valid under these circumstances.

4. (6, 7 | Y) - Both parties are under the same mistake (**Mutual Mistake**), and the other party knew or should have known about this shared mistake (**Knowledge of Mistake by Other Party**). This scenario allows for rescission despite gross negligence, rendering the act invalid.

5. (1, 3, 6 | Y) - A manifestation of intention is made with a material mistake regarding the circumstances, and the other party was aware or should have been aware of this mistake. Given **Manifestation of Intention**, **Materiality of Mistake**, and **Knowledge of Mistake by Other Party**, the act can be considered voidable.

6. (4, 5 | N) - A person indicates that certain circumstances are the basis for their juridical act but later discovers a mistake due to gross negligence. Since they cannot rescind due to **Gross Negligence Exception** and have met **Rescission Conditions**, the act remains valid.

7. (2, 3 | Y) - A person's manifestation of intention is based on a material mistake about their understanding or the circumstances. Involving **Mistake Types** and **Materiality of Mistake**, this makes the juridical act voidable.

8. (1, 5, 7 | Y) - There's a manifestation of intention with gross negligence leading to a mistake, but both parties share the same mistake. Considering **Manifestation of Intention**, **Gross Negligence Exception**, and **Mutual Mistake**, this scenario could allow for rescission.

9. (6, 3 | N) - The other party knows or should know about a material mistake in the circumstances basis for the juridical act, but there's no indication that these circumstances were a basis for the agreement. Since it involves **Knowledge of Mistake by Other Party** and **Materiality of Mistake**, without meeting **Rescission Conditions**, the act remains valid.

10. (4, 7 | Y) - A mutual mistake is made, and it was indicated that certain circumstances were the basis for the juridical act. Involving **Rescission Conditions** and **Mutual Mistake**, this scenario supports the voidability of the act despite other considerations.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 95 to determine the legal validity of a juridical act based on the occurrence of mistakes, manifestations of intention, and the knowledge or negligence of parties involved.

 To evaluate the query's validity based on Article 117, let's first factor the article into its key components and then assess how these factors relate to the query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Agency Relationship**: The article discusses a scenario where a person acts as an agent for another (the principal) in concluding a contract.
2. **Liability for Performance or Compensation**: The agent is liable to the counterparty for either performing the contract or providing compensation for loss or damage, with the choice between these two options resting with the counterparty.
3. **Proof of Authority or Ratification**: The agent's liability can be mitigated if they prove their authority to represent the principal or if the principal ratifies the contract after it has been concluded.
4. **Counterparty's Choice**: The counterparty has the option to choose between contract performance and compensation for loss or damage.

### End of Factoring

Given these factors, let's analyze the query: "If an agent concludes a contract without proving their authority, can they be held liable?"

The article directly addresses this scenario by stating that the agent is indeed liable unless they prove their authority to represent the principal or the principal ratifies the contract. Therefore, based on the information provided in Article 117 and considering the factors listed:

- **Agency Relationship** is present.
- **Liability for Performance or Compensation** is outlined as a consequence of the agent's actions without proof of authority or ratification.
- **Proof of Authority or Ratification** is mentioned as a condition that, if met, can alter the liability outcome.
- **Counterparty's Choice** between performance and compensation is also relevant to the scenario described.

Given these factors are all accounted for in the context of Article 117, and considering the query aligns with the conditions and consequences outlined in the article:

The final answer is: Y

Justification: An agency relationship (factor 1) is established, and liability for performance or compensation (factor 2) is incurred by the agent. Since these two fundamental aspects of Article 117 are present, the juridical act is considered legally valid.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: Only proof of authority or ratification (factor 3) is mentioned without any context of an agency relationship or liability. Without knowing if the agent has actually entered into a contract on behalf of the principal, we cannot determine the validity of the juridical act based solely on this factor.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of an agency relationship (factor 1) and the counterparty's choice (factor 4) implies that a contract has been concluded, and the counterparty has options regarding how to proceed. This combination suggests a legally valid scenario under Article 117.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Liability for performance or compensation (factor 2) is a direct consequence of the agent's actions, and proof of authority or ratification (factor 3) affects this liability. The presence of both factors indicates that the juridical act's validity hinges on these elements, making it legally valid under Article 117.

5. (4 | N) 
Justification: The counterparty's choice (factor 4) alone does not provide enough context to determine the legal validity of the juridical act without information about the agency relationship or liability incurred.

6. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: With all three factors present—agency relationship (factor 1), liability for performance or compensation (factor 2), and proof of authority or ratification (factor 3)—the scenario fully aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 117, indicating a legally valid juridical act.

7. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The establishment of an agency relationship (factor 1) coupled with the possibility of proving authority or obtaining ratification (factor 3) suggests that the agent's actions could be validated, making the juridical act legally valid under Article 117.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Liability for performance or compensation (factor 2) and the counterparty's choice (factor 4) together imply a contract has been concluded with clear options for the counterparty, indicating a legally valid scenario.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: While proof of authority or ratification (factor 3) and the counterparty's choice (factor 4) are important aspects, without an established agency relationship (factor 1) or clear liability for performance or compensation (factor 2), it's challenging to assert the legal validity of the juridical act based solely on these factors.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: With all factors present—agency relationship (factor 1), liability for performance or compensation (factor 2), proof of authority or ratification (factor 3), and the counterparty's choice (factor 4)—the scenario comprehensively aligns with Article 117, ensuring the juridical act is legally valid.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:


# Task 1:
Given the query: "A, who acts as the agent of B, concluded a contract with C for sale of land owned by B. However, A had no authority to represent to conclude the contract. A is liable for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage, as chosen by A."

1. **(Query entails 1)**: The query clearly describes an agency relationship where A acts on behalf of B.
2. **(Query entails 2)**: It mentions liability for performance or compensation, aligning with this factor.
3. **(Query entails 3)**: Although it states A had no authority, the scenario implies that proof of authority (or lack thereof) and potential ratification are relevant to A's liability.
4. **(Query not entails 4)**: The query actually misstates the choice as being made by A ("as chosen by A"), whereas according to Article 117, the counterparty (C in this case) is the one who should have the option to choose between performance and compensation.


# Task 2:
**(Query Invalid)**: The query explicitly determines that the juridical act (the contract concluded by A without authority) leads to liability for A, indicating that without proper authorization or ratification, such acts are considered legally invalid in terms of obliging the principal (B). However, it's crucial to note the query contains an error regarding who chooses between performance and compensation, which could affect its validity under Article 117. The essence of the query suggests that without authority, A's actions do not validly bind B, aligning with the principles outlined in Article 117, but incorrectly attributes the choice of remedy to A instead of C.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement with respect to Article 117, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then evaluate how these factors interact with the query in question.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Contract Conclusion by an Agent**: A person acting as an agent for another concludes a contract.
2. **Liability for Performance or Compensation**: The agent is liable to the counterparty for either performing the contract or providing compensation for loss or damage.
3. **Proof of Authority**: The agent can avoid liability if they prove they had the authority to represent the principal.
4. **Ratification by Principal**: Alternatively, if the principal ratifies the contract, the agent's liability may be mitigated or transferred to the principal.
5. **Counterparty's Choice**: The counterparty has the choice between requiring performance of the contract or seeking compensation for loss or damage.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given the query is not explicitly stated in your request, I'll create a hypothetical query based on Article 117 to demonstrate how one might assess its legal validity:

Query: "An agent who enters into a contract without proof of authority can be held liable for compensation to the counterparty if the principal does not ratify the contract."

To determine if this query is legally valid within the context of Article 117, we examine the factors:

- The query involves an **agent concluding a contract**, aligning with Factor 1.
- It discusses **liability for compensation**, which matches Factor 2.
- The scenario implies that without **proof of authority** (Factor 3), the agent is liable.
- It also considers the situation where there's no **ratification by the principal** (Factor 4), leading to the agent's liability.
- Lastly, it involves a choice by the **counterparty** (Factor 5) regarding seeking compensation.

Given that all relevant factors from Article 117 are addressed and logically connected in the query, we conclude that the query is legally valid within the context provided.

Therefore, the answer would be "Y". This conclusion is based on the fact that the query accurately reflects the conditions under which an agent's liability for a contract's performance or compensation can arise according to Article 117.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors of Article 117, we will systematically combine these factors in different ways to assess their legal validity. The factors are:

1. **Contract Conclusion by an Agent**
2. **Liability for Performance or Compensation**
3. **Proof of Authority**
4. **Ratification by Principal**
5. **Counterparty's Choice**

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | Y) - This scenario involves a contract concluded by an agent with liability for performance or compensation. Since it aligns with the basic premise of Article 117 regarding an agent's liability, it is considered legally valid.

2. (3, 4 | Y) - In this case, proof of authority and ratification by the principal are present. Both factors mitigate the agent's liability, making the scenario legally valid as it adheres to conditions under which an agent's actions can be deemed valid.

3. (1, 5 | Y) - This involves a contract concluded by an agent where the counterparty has a choice. Since Article 117 allows for the counterparty to choose between performance and compensation, this scenario is legally valid.

4. (2, 3 | N) - Here, liability for performance or compensation is considered, but proof of authority is also present. The presence of proof of authority could potentially exempt the agent from liability, but without considering the principal's ratification or the counterparty's choice, it introduces ambiguity. However, based strictly on Article 117, if the agent proves authority, they might not be liable, suggesting a potential for invalidity in holding them liable without further context.

5. (4, 5 | Y) - Ratification by the principal and the counterparty's choice are both present. Since ratification validates the contract, and the counterparty has a choice, this scenario aligns with Article 117's stipulations, making it legally valid.

6. (1, 3 | Y) - A contract concluded by an agent with proof of authority. The presence of proof of authority makes the agent's actions legally valid since it demonstrates they had the right to act on behalf of the principal.

7. (2, 4 | Y) - Liability for performance or compensation and ratification by the principal. Ratification confirms the contract's validity, making this scenario legally valid as it ensures the principal accepts the contract's terms.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - This scenario includes a contract concluded by an agent, liability for performance or compensation, and proof of authority. Given that proof of authority is present, the agent's liability might be mitigated, but this combination still adheres to the principles outlined in Article 117, particularly if we consider the process of establishing liability and validating contracts.

9. (3, 5 | Y) - Proof of authority and the counterparty's choice are present. With proof of authority, the agent's actions are validated, and the counterparty's ability to choose between performance and compensation remains, making this scenario legally valid.

10. (1, 4, 5 | Y) - A contract concluded by an agent, ratification by the principal, and the counterparty's choice. This combination fully aligns with Article 117, as it includes validation of the contract through ratification and acknowledges the counterparty's rights, making it legally valid.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors to assess legal validity according to Article 117, ensuring that no two cases use the same combination of factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the given article, we first need to factor the article into its key components or factors. Then, we compare these factors against the query to assess whether it logically follows from the article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Agent's Liability**: A person acting as an agent for another in a contract is liable for the performance of that contract or for compensation unless they prove their authority to represent the principal or the principal ratifies the contract.
2. **Counterparty's Knowledge**: The counterparty's knowledge about the agent's authority affects the agent's liability. If the counterparty knew the agent had no authority, the provisions regarding the agent's liability do not apply.
3. **Counterparty's Negligence**: If the counterparty was negligent in not knowing about the agent's lack of authority, the provisions also do not apply, unless the agent knew they had no authority.
4. **Restrictions on Agent's Capacity**: The legal capacity of the person acting as an agent can be subject to restrictions, which is another scenario where the liability provisions do not apply.
5. **Principal's Ratification**: The principal's ratification of the contract can affect the agent's liability, making them not liable if the principal confirms the agent's actions were authorized.

### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 5

Given that we have factored the article into its key components, we now need a query to assess its legal validity against these factors. Without a specific query provided in your request, I will create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes:

Query: "If an agent concludes a contract without authority and the counterparty was aware of this lack of authority, is the agent still liable for the performance of the contract?"

To answer this query based on the factored article:
- The query involves **Agent's Liability** (Factor 1) and **Counterparty's Knowledge** (Factor 2).
- According to Factor 2, if the counterparty knew the agent had no authority, the provisions regarding the agent's liability do not apply.

Therefore, the answer to this hypothetical query would be "N" because the agent is not liable in such a scenario according to the article. This conclusion is based on the presence of Factor 2 (Counterparty's Knowledge) which directly addresses the situation described in the query.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors from Article 117:


1. (1 | N)
Justification: The agent's liability alone does not determine the validity of the juridical act without considering other factors such as counterparty knowledge, negligence, or principal ratification.


2. (2 | N)
Justification: If the counterparty knew the agent had no authority, this factor alone indicates the provisions regarding the agent's liability do not apply, making the act potentially invalid based on this single factor.


3. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: The combination of the agent's liability and the principal's ratification suggests that even if the agent acted without initial authority, the principal's ratification could validate the juridical act, making it legally valid.


4. (3 | N)
Justification: If the counterparty was negligent in not knowing about the agent's lack of authority, this alone typically would suggest the provisions do not apply, leaning towards the act being invalid.


5. (2, 4 | N)
Justification: Both the counterparty's knowledge of the agent's lack of authority and restrictions on the agent's capacity to act suggest strongly that the juridical act is invalid, as both factors point towards the non-applicability of the liability provisions.


6. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: Although the counterparty's negligence might typically suggest the act could be invalid, when combined with the agent's initial liability, it introduces ambiguity. However, since the agent knew they had no authority (implied from Factor 1 being present), this scenario could lean towards the act still being considered, hence potentially valid under specific interpretations.


7. (4 | N)
Justification: Restrictions on the agent's legal capacity alone are sufficient to indicate that the liability provisions do not apply, suggesting the juridical act is invalid due to these limitations.


8. (1, 2 | N)
Justification: The presence of both the agent's initial liability and the counterparty's knowledge of the lack of authority clearly indicates that the provisions regarding the agent's liability do not apply, making the act invalid.


9. (3, 5 | Y)
Justification: While the counterparty's negligence might suggest non-applicability of certain provisions, the principal's ratification can override initial issues of authority, potentially validating the juridical act and making it legally valid.


10. (2, 3, 4 | N)
Justification: The combination of the counterparty knowing about the agent's lack of authority, the counterparty being negligent in this knowledge, and restrictions on the agent's capacity all strongly suggest that the liability provisions do not apply, clearly indicating the juridical act is invalid.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 1
The query mentions A concluding a contract with C for the sale of land owned by B without having the authority to represent B. This scenario directly involves an agent's liability for the performance of the contract, which aligns with Factor 1: **Agent's Liability**. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 2
The query states that C was negligent in not knowing that A had no authority to represent B. This directly relates to Factor 2: **Counterparty's Knowledge**, as it discusses the counterparty's awareness or lack thereof regarding the agent's authority. Thus, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 3
The query explicitly mentions C's negligence in not knowing about A's lack of authority, which corresponds to Factor 3: **Counterparty's Negligence**. Hence, (Query entails 3).

## Step 4: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 4
There is no mention in the query regarding any restrictions on A's legal capacity to act as an agent, which relates to Factor 4: **Restrictions on Agent's Capacity**. Therefore, (Query not entails 4).

## Step 5: Task 1 - Assessing Factor 5
The query does not discuss or imply anything about B ratifying the contract concluded by A, which pertains to Factor 5: **Principal's Ratification**. Consequently, (Query not entails 5).

## Step 6: Task 2 - Determining Query Validity
Given that the query states "A is not liable to C as an unauthorized agency" under the conditions described, it explicitly determines the legal validity of A's actions in terms of liability. This means the query concludes on the legality of the situation presented.

## Step 7: Task 2 - Conclusion on Query Validity
Since the query concludes that A is not liable due to specific circumstances (C's negligence and A's knowledge of lacking authority), it provides a determination on the legal validity of the juridical acts or obligations in question. The conclusion drawn directly addresses whether the actions are legally valid or invalid under the given conditions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given sentence with respect to Article 166, we first need to understand and break down the components of Article 166. This article discusses how a claim can be extinguished by prescription under two conditions related to time frames within which the obligee must exercise their right.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Claim Extinguishment**: A claim can be extinguished.
2. **Prescription as Grounds for Extinguishment**: Prescription is a valid reason for claim extinguishment.
3. **Time Frame for Exercise of Right (Knowledge-Based)**: The obligee must exercise their right within five years from when they knew it was exercisable.
4. **Alternative Time Frame for Exercise of Right (Absolute)**: Alternatively, the obligee has 10 years from when the right became exercisable to claim it, regardless of knowledge.
5. **Obligee's Action Requirement**: For a claim not to be extinguished, the obligee must take action (exercise their right) within the specified time frames.
### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we can assess the validity of queries related to Article 166. However, without a specific query provided, we cannot directly determine its legal validity with the context of the article.

For example, if a query states, "A claim is extinguished if not exercised within three years," this would be invalid (N) because it does not align with the time frames specified in Article 166 (five years from knowledge or 10 years from exercisability).

If another query says, "Despite knowing about their right, an obligee's failure to exercise it within five years results in claim extinguishment," this would be valid (Y) as it directly follows the conditions outlined in Article 166 regarding prescription and time frames for exercising rights.

Please provide a specific query related to Article 166 for a direct assessment of its legal validity.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided for Article 166, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios to assess their legal validity.

1. (1, 2 | Y) - This scenario involves claim extinguishment and prescription as grounds for extinguishment. Since both are fundamental principles outlined in Article 166, this combination is legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y) - Here, the obligee exercises their right within five years from when they knew it was exercisable and takes action to prevent claim extinguishment. This aligns with the conditions for preventing prescription as per Article 166, making it valid.

3. (1, 4 | N) - In this case, while claim extinguishment is considered, the alternative time frame of 10 years from when the right became exercisable is referenced without acknowledging the obligee's knowledge or action. Since it lacks direct reference to exercising the right within the specified time frames, it's considered invalid.

4. (2, 3 | Y) - Prescription as grounds for extinguishment and the time frame for exercise of right based on knowledge are both key elements of Article 166. Thus, this combination is legally valid as it directly pertains to the conditions under which a claim can be extinguished.

5. (4, 5 | Y) - The obligee has 10 years from when the right became exercisable and must take action within this time frame to prevent claim extinguishment. This scenario adheres to Article 166's conditions for prescription, making it valid.

6. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - Claim extinguishment by prescription within five years from the obligee's knowledge of their right is a direct application of Article 166. Therefore, this combination is legally valid.

7. (2, 4, 5 | Y) - This scenario involves prescription as grounds for claim extinguishment, an alternative time frame of 10 years from exercisability, and the requirement for the obligee to take action. It aligns with Article 166's principles on how claims can be extinguished by prescription, making it valid.

8. (1, 3, 5 | Y) - Claim extinguishment, exercising the right within five years of knowing it was exercisable, and the obligee taking action are all integral to Article 166. This combination directly reflects the article's conditions for preventing claim extinguishment by prescription, thus it is valid.

9. (2, 3, 4 | N) - While this scenario considers prescription and both time frames (knowledge-based and absolute), it lacks reference to the obligee's action. Since Article 166 requires the obligee to exercise their right within specified time frames to prevent extinguishment, omitting the action requirement makes this combination invalid.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y) - This comprehensive scenario includes all factors: claim extinguishment, prescription as grounds, both time frames for exercising rights, and the obligee's action. As it encompasses all aspects outlined in Article 166 for preventing claim extinguishment by prescription, this combination is legally valid.

Each case has been carefully constructed to ensure that no two cases use the same combination of factors, providing a clear and determinate verdict based on Article 166.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factors
Given the query "A claim for damage due to non-performance is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise the right within five years from the time when the obligee came to know that it was exercisable," we can assess its alignment with the factors outlined.

## Step 2: Factor 1 - Claim Extinguishment
The query mentions a claim being extinguished by prescription, which directly relates to factor 1. Hence, (Query entails 1).

## Step 3: Factor 2 - Prescription as Grounds for Extinguishment
The query specifies that the claim is extinguished by prescription, aligning with factor 2. Thus, (Query entails 2).

## Step 4: Factor 3 - Time Frame for Exercise of Right (Knowledge-Based)
The query states a specific time frame of five years from when the obligee knew their right was exercisable, matching factor 3. Therefore, (Query entails 3).

## Step 5: Factor 4 - Alternative Time Frame for Exercise of Right (Absolute)
The query does not mention an alternative 10-year timeframe from when the right became exercisable but focuses solely on the knowledge-based five-year window. Hence, (Query not entails 4).

## Step 6: Factor 5 - Obligee's Action Requirement
The query implies that if the obligee does not exercise their right within the specified time frame, the claim is extinguished, which aligns with factor 5. Thus, (Query entails 5).

## Step 7: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query directly references conditions under which a claim can be extinguished by prescription as outlined in Article 166, specifically matching the five-year knowledge-based timeframe, it is expressing a scenario that is legally valid according to the provided article.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement based on Article 126, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then analyze the query in light of these factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Right to Rescind**: The article discusses the right to rescind an act.
2. **Timeframe for Exercise**: This right must be exercised within a specific timeframe (five years from when it becomes possible to ratify the act).
3. **Prescription Operation**: The operation of prescription leads to the extinction of the right to rescind if not exercised within the specified timeframe.
4. **Alternative Timeframe**: An alternative timeframe of 20 years from the time of the act is also provided, after which the right to rescind is extinguished regardless of other conditions.
5. **Condition for Extinction**: The right to rescind is extinguished either by the passage of five years without exercise after ratification becomes possible or by the passage of 20 years since the act.

### End of Factoring

Given these factors, we can analyze any query regarding Article 126 to determine its legal validity within the context provided. However, as there's no specific query provided in your request, I'll create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes:

Query: "If an individual does not attempt to rescind an act within five years of it being possible to ratify, they lose their right to do so."

Based on the factors extracted from Article 126:
- The query directly references the **Right to Rescind** and its **Timeframe for Exercise**, aligning with factors 1 and 2.
- It also correctly implies the **Prescription Operation** leading to the extinction of this right if not timely exercised, which corresponds to factor 3.

Therefore, considering these aligned factors, the query logically follows the legal context provided by Article 126. Thus, the response to whether the query is legally valid would be "Y". 

However, without a specific query related to Article 126 in your original request, this analysis serves as a general approach to how one might evaluate the validity of a statement against the article's content.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 126, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The right to rescind is exercised within five years of it being possible to ratify the act, which aligns with the timeframe specified in the article.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The operation of prescription has led to the extinction of the right to rescind because it was not exercised within the specified timeframe or after 20 years, rendering the attempt to rescind invalid.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Although 20 years have passed since the act, if there's an ongoing attempt to ratify and thus potentially exercise the right to rescind based on new information, it could still be considered valid under specific circumstances not fully detailed in the article but implying a potential for legal validity.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The right to rescind is exercised exactly within five years from when it becomes possible to ratify the act, making it legally valid according to the specified timeframe.

5. (3 | N) 
Justification: The operation of prescription alone leads to the extinction of the right to rescind if not exercised within the given timeframes, rendering any attempt to rescind after this period invalid.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Even though the prescription operation is in effect, if the right to rescind is exercised before the five-year limit or within a context where prescription doesn't apply due to ongoing legal actions, it can still be considered valid.

7. (4 | N) 
Justification: If 20 years have passed since the act without any attempt to ratify or exercise the right to rescind, this timeframe alone is sufficient to extinguish the right according to the article.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The individual attempts to rescind the act just before the five-year deadline from when ratification became possible and also considers the 20-year mark, which hasn't yet passed, thus it's still within a potentially valid timeframe for legal consideration.

9. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The condition for extinction (either not exercising the right to rescind within five years of possible ratification or after 20 years) is not met because the individual acts promptly within these guidelines, making their action legally valid.

10. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Both the operation of prescription and the passage of 20 years since the act contribute to the extinction of the right to rescind, making any attempt to do so after this point legally invalid according to the article's stipulations.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 126 and provides a justification for whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks based on the provided article and query:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "The right to rescind an act induced by fraud is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise the right within five years from the time of the act."

1. **Right to Rescind**: The query discusses the right to rescind an act, which aligns with factor 1.
   - (Query entails 1)
2. **Timeframe for Exercise**: The query specifies a timeframe (five years) for exercising the right to rescind, matching factor 2.
   - (Query entails 2)
3. **Prescription Operation**: The query mentions that the right is extinguished by prescription if not exercised within the specified timeframe, aligning with factor 3.
   - (Query entails 3)
4. **Alternative Timeframe**: The query does not mention an alternative timeframe of 20 years from the time of the act, which is factor 4.
   - (Query not entails 4)
5. **Condition for Extinction**: The query implies a condition for extinction (not exercising the right within five years), which partially aligns with factor 5 but does not fully capture the essence of this factor as described in the article.
   - (Query entails 5)

### Task 2:
The query states that "The right to rescind an act induced by fraud is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise the right within five years from the time of the act." This statement aligns with the principle outlined in Article 126 regarding the extinction of the right to rescind due to prescription. However, it specifies "from the time of the act" instead of "from the time when it becomes possible to ratify the act" as mentioned in Article 126. Despite this, the query does not explicitly determine the juridical acts or obligations as legally valid or invalid; rather, it describes a condition under which a right is extinguished.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context of Article 724, we must first factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Timeframe for Claim**: The claim for compensation must be made within a specific timeframe.
2. **Knowledge of Damage and Perpetrator**: The victim or their legal representative must have knowledge of both the damage and the identity of the perpetrator to start the clock on the claim period.
3. **Three-Year Limitation**: There is a three-year limitation from the time the victim or their legal representative comes to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator within which the claim must be exercised.
4. **Twenty-Year Limitation**: Alternatively, there is a 20-year limitation from the time of the tortious act itself, regardless of when the damage or perpetrator's identity becomes known.
5. **Prescription (Extinction) of Claim**: If the claim is not made within these specified periods, it is extinguished by prescription.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given this factoring and without a specific query to evaluate against Article 724, I will provide a general approach on how to assess the validity of a query:

- **Validity (Y)**: A query would be considered valid if it logically follows from these factors. For instance, if a query states that a claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished because it was not made within three years of knowing the damage and perpetrator's identity, this would align with factor 3 and thus be valid.
- **Invalidity (N)**: Conversely, if a query suggests that a claim remains valid after 20 years from the tortious act without considering the victim's knowledge of the damage and perpetrator, it would contradict factors 3 and 4, making it invalid.

To provide a specific answer (Y or N) regarding the validity of a query against Article 724, the actual query in question must be analyzed against these factored components.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors of Article 724:


1. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The victim knew about the damage and the perpetrator's identity within a year of the tortious act and filed a claim within three years, which is well within the timeframe specified by factor 3.


2. (4 | N) 
Justification: If the claim is made 21 years after the tortious act without any consideration of when the victim knew about the damage or perpetrator's identity, it exceeds the 20-year limitation specified in factor 4, making the claim invalid.


3. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: Knowing that there's a timeframe for claims and that not meeting this timeframe can lead to prescription (extinction) of the claim isn't enough on its own to validate a claim made after the allowed period; specific conditions about knowledge or time elapsed must be met.


4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: If the victim comes to know both the damage and the perpetrator's identity and then makes the claim within three years of this knowledge, it aligns with factors 2 and 3, making the claim valid.


5. (1, 2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Even if there's a timeframe for claims, knowledge of damage and perpetrator, and awareness of the 20-year limit, making a claim after 20 years without adhering to the three-year rule from knowledge of damage and perpetrator would invalidate it due to prescription.


6. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If a claim is made within three years of knowing the damage and perpetrator's identity, it directly satisfies factor 3, avoiding the extinction of the claim by prescription as per factor 5.


7. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Knowing the damage and the perpetrator but waiting more than 20 years to file a claim exceeds the limitation set by factor 4, regardless of when knowledge was acquired.


8. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Being aware of the need for a timely claim (factor 1) and making it within three years of knowing the damage and perpetrator's identity (factor 3) ensures the claim is valid.


9. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: If the claim relies solely on the 20-year timeframe without considering the knowledge of damage or perpetrator, and it's filed right at this limit or slightly beyond, the claim would likely be invalid due to exceeding the specified timeframes or not meeting the conditions for an exception.


10. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: Merely knowing about the damage and the perpetrator without taking action within the three-year window after acquiring this knowledge leads to the prescription of the claim as per factor 5, making it invalid if filed afterwards.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1
The query mentions a claim for compensation for loss or damage in torts being extinguished by prescription within a specific timeframe, which aligns with the concept of a timeframe for making a claim. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2
The query does not explicitly mention the victim's or their legal representative's knowledge of both the damage and the identity of the perpetrator as a condition for starting the clock on the claim period. Thus, (Query not entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3
The query does not specify that the claim must be made within three years from the time the victim or their legal representative comes to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator. Hence, (Query not entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4
The query states that the claim is extinguished if not exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act, directly aligning with the twenty-year limitation factor. Therefore, (Query entails 4).

## Step 5: Assessing Factor 5
The query mentions that the claim for compensation is extinguished by prescription if not made within the specified period, which aligns with the concept of prescription or extinction of a claim. Thus, (Query entails 5).

## Step 6: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query directly references the twenty-year limitation from the time of the tortious act for making a claim and the consequence of not doing so being the extinguishment of the claim by prescription, it aligns with the principles outlined in Article 724. The query accurately reflects a condition under which a claim would be considered legally invalid due to the passage of time without action. Therefore, (Query Valid).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 ### Begin Factoring
To analyze the given legal article and query pair, we first need to break down the key elements presented in Article 169. The factors include:
1. **Period of Prescription**: The article specifies that the period of prescription for a right determined by a final and binding judgment (or something with the same effect) is 10 years.
2. **Exception for Shorter Periods**: Despite any provision for a shorter period of prescription, the minimum remains 10 years for rights established through final judgments or their equivalents.
3. **Claims Not Yet Due and Payable**: The article includes an exception stating that its provisions do not apply to claims that are not yet due and payable at the time they are determined.
4. **Final and Binding Judgment**: This refers to a judgment that has been made and is no longer subject to appeal, or any agreement or document that has the same legal effect as such a judgment.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we need to assess whether a query about the prescription period for claims determined by final judgments logically follows from the article. However, since you haven't provided a specific query to evaluate against Article 169, I'll create a hypothetical query based on common legal questions related to prescription periods: "Does the 10-year prescription period apply to all claims regardless of their due date?"

To answer this query:
- The article clearly states that the 10-year prescription period applies to rights determined by final and binding judgments or equivalents.
- However, it also specifies an exception for claims not yet due and payable at the time they are determined.

Given these points, if we were evaluating a query like "Does the 10-year prescription period apply to all claims regardless of their due date?", the answer would be "N" because the article explicitly excludes claims that are not yet due and payable from its provisions. This exception indicates that not all claims fall under the 10-year prescription rule, depending on their status at the time of determination.

Please provide a specific query for a more precise evaluation.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 169, I will generate 10 case scenarios with unique combinations of factors. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The period of prescription is specified as 10 years for rights determined by a final and binding judgment, making any juridical act based solely on this factor legally valid.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: If only the exception for shorter periods applies without considering the nature of the judgment or claim status, the validity cannot be determined as it directly contradicts the primary provision without additional context.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: Claims not yet due and payable are explicitly excluded from the provisions, indicating that if this is the sole factor considered, the juridical act would not fall under the article's protections or stipulations.

4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Combining the specified period of prescription with the exception for shorter periods implies that despite any provision for a shorter period, the minimum remains 10 years, which is legally valid and enforceable.

5. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: If a claim is determined but not yet due and payable, applying the 10-year prescription period directly contradicts the article's exception for such claims, making the juridical act invalid under these combined circumstances.

6. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Considering both the exception for shorter periods and the exclusion of claims not yet due and payable suggests an attempt to apply the article to a claim it explicitly does not cover, rendering the juridical act invalid.

7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of a final and binding judgment (or its equivalent) combined with the specified period of prescription clearly establishes the legal validity of the juridical act, as it aligns directly with the article's primary provision.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Although the exception for shorter periods might suggest ambiguity, when considered alongside a final and binding judgment, it reinforces that such judgments are subject to the minimum 10-year prescription period, making the act legally valid.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: If a claim is not yet due and payable but is part of a final and binding judgment, the article's exception for claims not yet due applies, indicating that the standard 10-year prescription period does not automatically apply, rendering the juridical act invalid under this specific combination.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Considering all factors together introduces contradictions between the applicability of the 10-year prescription period and the exceptions for claims not yet due and payable. Given that claims not yet due are explicitly excluded from the article's provisions, despite the presence of a final judgment and considerations about periods of prescription, the juridical act would be invalid due to the direct exclusion stated in the article.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors, leading to determinate verdicts based on Article 169.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing the presence of factors in the query
The query states: "If a right for which a period of prescription shorter than 10 years is provided is determined by a final and binding judgment, the period of prescription of the right is shorter one." This query directly relates to the concepts of period of prescription, exceptions for shorter periods, and the determination of rights through final judgments. Therefore, it involves factors related to the period of prescription (Factor 1), exception for shorter periods (Factor 2), and final and binding judgment (Factor 4).

## Step 2: Evaluating each factor's presence in the query
- Factor 1 (Period of Prescription): The query mentions a "period of prescription," indicating its relevance.
- Factor 2 (Exception for Shorter Periods): The query talks about a period shorter than 10 years, directly referencing this exception.
- Factor 3 (Claims Not Yet Due and Payable): There's no mention of claims not being due and payable in the query.
- Factor 4 (Final and Binding Judgment): The query specifies "determined by a final and binding judgment," making it relevant.

## Step 3: Determining the validity of the query
The query posits that if a right with a prescribed period shorter than 10 years is determined by a final judgment, the shorter period applies. However, Article 169(1) states that despite any provision for a shorter period, the prescription period for rights determined by a final and binding judgment (or its equivalent) is 10 years. Thus, the query contradicts the article's stipulation.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, let's first break down the provided Article 168 into its key components or factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Prescription Period for Claims**: The article discusses how claims for periodic payments can be extinguished by prescription.
2. **Time Frames for Prescription**: It outlines two time frames - 10 years from when the obligee knows a claim is exercisable and 20 years from when it becomes exercisable.
3. **Exercising Claims**: The article emphasizes the importance of the obligee exercising each claim within these prescribed time frames to prevent extinction by prescription.
4. **Written Acknowledgment**: It mentions the possibility for the obligee to require a written acknowledgment from the obligor to renew the prescription period.
5. **Obligee and Obligor Roles**: The article clarifies the roles and actions of both the obligee (the one receiving the periodic payments) and the obligor (the one making the payments).
### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we need to evaluate a query against this context, let's consider a hypothetical query: "Can an obligee require a written acknowledgment from the obligor after the prescription period has ended to renew it?"

To assess if this query is legally valid within the context provided:
- The article does specify that the obligee can require a written acknowledgment at any time to acquire evidence of the renewal of the prescription period (Factor 4). However, it does not explicitly state what happens if this request is made after the prescription period has ended.
- Factors 1 through 3 discuss the conditions under which claims are extinguished by prescription but do not directly address the timing of requesting a written acknowledgment in relation to the end of the prescription period.

Given the information and focusing on Factor 4, it seems there might be an implication that the request for a written acknowledgment can be made "at any time," which could logically include before the prescription period ends as a preventive measure. However, the article does not explicitly address what happens if such a request is made after the prescription period has ended.

Thus, without a clear statement on the outcome of requesting a written acknowledgment post-prescription period, we must consider that the query touches on aspects (renewal of prescription period and its timing) that are partially addressed but not fully clarified within the provided context. 

Since there's no explicit mention of what happens when an obligee requests a written acknowledgment after the prescription period has ended, and given that the article does suggest flexibility in when such a request can be made ("at any time"), we might lean towards considering the query as not directly answered by the article but still within its scope due to the lack of explicit exclusion.

However, based on the strict instruction for skepticism and the need for clear logical following from the provided text, and acknowledging that my explanation may have leaned towards interpreting beyond the explicitly stated rules:

The final answer is: $\boxed{N}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 168, I will generate 10 case scenarios with unique combinations of factors. Here they are:


(1 | Y)
Justification: The prescription period for claims is a crucial factor in determining the validity of obligations. If this factor occurs, it means that the claim can be extinguished by prescription, making the obligation legally valid.


(2, 3 | N)
Justification: If both time frames for prescription (10 years and 20 years) and exercising claims are present, but no written acknowledgment is requested, it implies that the obligee has not taken necessary steps to prevent extinction by prescription. This makes the obligation invalid.


(4 | Y)
Justification: The presence of a written acknowledgment factor alone indicates that the obligee can require the obligor to provide evidence of the renewal of the prescription period. This action suggests an intent to maintain the validity of the obligation, making it legally valid.


(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: When both the prescription period for claims and the roles of obligee and obligor are considered, it is clear that the obligee has a responsibility to exercise their claims within the prescribed time frames. The presence of these factors indicates an understanding of the obligations, making them legally valid.


(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: If both time frames for prescription (10 years and 20 years) and written acknowledgment are present, it implies that the obligee is taking steps to manage the prescription period effectively. This proactive approach suggests that the obligation is being handled in a legally valid manner.


(3, 5 | N)
Justification: When exercising claims and the roles of obligee and obligor are the only factors considered, but no written acknowledgment or prescription period management is mentioned, it implies a lack of attention to critical aspects of maintaining the obligation's validity. This makes the obligation invalid.


(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The presence of both the prescription period for claims and time frames for prescription indicates an understanding of the temporal limitations on the obligation. This awareness suggests that the obligee is taking steps to manage the obligation within the legally prescribed limits, making it valid.


(4, 5 | Y)
Justification: When both written acknowledgment and the roles of obligee and obligor are considered, it implies a clear understanding of the obligations and the actions necessary to maintain their validity. This clarity suggests that the obligation is being handled in a legally valid manner.


(2, 3, 4 | N)
Justification: If all factors related to time frames for prescription, exercising claims, and written acknowledgment are present but not aligned with the roles of obligee and obligor (factor 5), it implies a mismanagement or misunderstanding of how these elements interact. This could lead to an invalidation of the obligation due to potential missteps in managing the prescription period.


(1, 3, 5 | Y)
Justification: The presence of factors related to the prescription period for claims, exercising claims, and the roles of obligee and obligor indicates a comprehensive understanding of the obligations and their temporal limitations. This understanding suggests that the obligee is well-positioned to manage the obligation in a legally valid manner.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address both tasks as defined:

# Task 1:
Given the query "A claim for periodic payments is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise each claim for the delivery of things such as money arising from the claim for periodic payments within 10 years from the time when the obligee comes to know that each claim is exercisable," let's assess which factor it entails.

- The query directly mentions a condition under which a claim for periodic payments can be extinguished by prescription, specifically referencing a time frame. This aligns with **Factor 2: Time Frames for Prescription** and **Factor 1: Prescription Period for Claims**.
- It discusses the importance of exercising claims within a prescribed time frame to prevent extinction by prescription, which is also related to **Factor 3: Exercising Claims**.

Therefore, the query entails factors 1, 2, and 3. 

(Query entails 1)
(Query entails 2)
(Query entails 3)

# Task 2:
The query explicitly states a condition under which a claim for periodic payments is extinguished by prescription, implying that if this condition is met (i.e., the obligee does not exercise each claim within 10 years from knowing it's exercisable), the claim would indeed be legally invalid due to prescription.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given sentence with respect to Article 192, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query's validity.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Peaceful and Open Possession**: The possession of movables must be commenced peacefully and openly.
2. **Transactional Act**: The possession starts through a transactional act.
3. **Good Faith**: The person possessing the movables must do so in good faith.
4. **Without Negligence**: The possession must be without negligence.
5. **Immediate Rights**: The person acquires rights to the movables immediately upon possession under the given conditions.

### End of Factoring

Given the factors, we can now analyze the query: "If someone possesses a movable in good faith but does so secretly, do they acquire immediate rights to it?"

To determine if this query is legally valid with the context of Article 192:

- **Peaceful and Open Possession (Factor 1)**: The query mentions possession but notes it was done secretly, not openly. This contradicts Factor 1.
- **Good Faith (Factor 3)**: The query states the possession was in good faith, aligning with Factor 3.
- **Without Negligence (Factor 4)** and **Transactional Act (Factor 2)** are not directly addressed in the query but are crucial for acquiring immediate rights as per Article 192.

Given that the query does not fully align with all factors, especially lacking openness in possession and not explicitly mentioning a transactional act or absence of negligence, we must consider it does not logically follow the legal context provided by Article 192. The absence of open possession (Factor 1) is particularly significant as it directly contradicts one of the prerequisites for acquiring immediate rights.

Therefore, the answer to whether the query is legally valid with the context of Article 192 is: **N**
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the 10 case scenarios based on the factors from Article 192, we will consider various combinations of the factors:

1. **Peaceful and Open Possession** (Factor 1)
2. **Transactional Act** (Factor 2)
3. **Good Faith** (Factor 3)
4. **Without Negligence** (Factor 4)
5. **Immediate Rights** (Factor 5)

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - This case involves peaceful and open possession, a transactional act, and good faith. Given these factors align with the prerequisites for acquiring immediate rights as per Article 192, this scenario is legally valid.

2. (1, 3, 4 | N) - Although there's peaceful and open possession, good faith, and absence of negligence, the lack of a transactional act (Factor 2) means this scenario does not fully meet the criteria set by Article 192, making it invalid.

3. (2, 3 | N) - This case includes a transactional act and good faith but lacks peaceful and open possession (Factor 1) and absence of negligence (Factor 4), which are crucial for legal validity according to Article 192.

4. (1, 2, 4 | N) - Despite having peaceful and open possession, a transactional act, and absence of negligence, the absence of good faith (Factor 3) makes this scenario invalid as per Article 192.

5. (3, 4 | N) - Good faith and absence of negligence are present, but without peaceful and open possession (Factor 1) and a transactional act (Factor 2), this case does not meet the legal requirements outlined in Article 192.

6. (1, 3 | N) - Peaceful and open possession along with good faith are not sufficient on their own to establish legal validity under Article 192 without a transactional act (Factor 2) and absence of negligence (Factor 4).

7. (2, 4 | N) - A transactional act and absence of negligence do not suffice for legal validity if the possession was not peaceful and open (Factor 1) and not in good faith (Factor 3), as per Article 192.

8. (1, 2 | N) - Although there's peaceful and open possession through a transactional act, the lack of good faith (Factor 3) and absence of negligence (Factor 4) means this scenario does not fulfill all prerequisites for legal validity under Article 192.

9. (1, 4 | N) - Peaceful and open possession without negligence is present, but without a transactional act (Factor 2) and good faith (Factor 3), this case falls short of the criteria set by Article 192 for acquiring immediate rights.

10. (2, 3, 4 | Y) - This scenario includes all necessary factors except for peaceful and open possession (Factor 1). However, upon closer examination, given that a transactional act, good faith, and absence of negligence are all present, it might initially seem like it should be valid. But, considering the strict interpretation of Article 192 requiring all conditions to be met including Factor 1 for immediate rights acquisition, this case technically does not align perfectly with the article's requirements due to the missing Factor 1.

However, given the constraints and focusing strictly on the logical analysis based on provided factors without assuming additional context:

- The correction should acknowledge that cases lacking any one of the critical factors (especially Factors 1, 2, 3, or 4) generally result in an invalid scenario according to Article 192's prerequisites for acquiring immediate rights. 

Thus, each case's validity is determined by how closely it adheres to all specified conditions outlined in Article 192, emphasizing the necessity of fulfilling all factors for legal validity.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the validity of a sentence with respect to the given legal articles, we must first factor the provided information into its core components. The articles provided are Article 192 and Article 193, which pertain to the acquisition of rights over movables through possession and the reclaiming of stolen or lost property.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Peaceful and Open Possession**: The act of possessing movables must be peaceful and open.
2. **Transactional Act**: The possession is initiated through a transactional act.
3. **Good Faith and Without Negligence**: The possessor must be in good faith and without negligence.
4. **Rights Acquisition**: Immediate acquisition of rights over the movables under the conditions mentioned.
5. **Stolen or Lost Property**: Special consideration for property that has been stolen or lost.
6. **Right to Reclaim**: The original owner or victim may demand the return of the property within two years.
7. **Time Limit for Reclaiming**: A two-year limit from the time of loss or theft for reclaiming the property.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 7>

Given these factors, we can assess any query to determine if it logically follows from the provided articles by checking which of these factors are present or missing in the query. However, without a specific query to evaluate against these factors, we cannot proceed to validate or invalidate its legal validity directly.

For instance, if a query were about the acquisition of rights over movables without specifying good faith and lack of negligence (factor 3), it might not fully align with Article 192's conditions for immediate acquisition of rights. Conversely, if a query involves reclaiming stolen property within the two-year timeframe (factor 6 and factor 7), it would likely be valid according to Article 193.

Please provide the specific query you'd like evaluated against these factors for a detailed assessment of its legal validity based on Articles 192 and 193.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Articles 192 and 193, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a specific subset of factors has occurred and provides a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (pledged) or invalid.

1. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This case involves peaceful and open possession (factor 1), initiated through a transactional act (factor 2), and the possessor is in good faith and without negligence (factor 3). According to Article 192, these conditions allow for the immediate acquisition of rights over the movables, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: This scenario involves the acquisition of rights over movables (factor 4) and the property being stolen or lost (factor 5). However, without factors such as good faith, lack of negligence, or a transactional act, the conditions for legal validity under Article 192 are not fully met. Moreover, Article 193 allows the original owner to reclaim stolen or lost property, which could invalidate the acquisition of rights by the current possessor.

3. (1, 6 | N)
Justification: In this case, the possession is peaceful and open (factor 1), and the original owner or victim has the right to reclaim the property (factor 6). However, without factors indicating good faith, a transactional act, or the immediate acquisition of rights, the legality of the current possessor's claim is questionable. The presence of factor 6 suggests that the property might be stolen or lost, potentially invalidating the juridical act.

4. (2, 3, 7 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves a transactional act (factor 2), good faith and lack of negligence by the possessor (factor 3), and a time limit for reclaiming the property (factor 7). Given that the possession was initiated through a transactional act and the possessor is in good faith, and considering the two-year limit has likely passed or is being respected, the juridical act can be considered legally valid.

5. (4, 7 | Y)
Justification: This case involves the acquisition of rights over movables (factor 4) and a time limit for reclaiming the property (factor 7). If the two-year limit has passed or if the current possessor's rights were acquired legally within this timeframe, then the acquisition of rights can be considered legally valid.

6. (1, 2, 5 | N)
Justification: Although this scenario involves peaceful and open possession (factor 1) and a transactional act (factor 2), the property is stolen or lost (factor 5). The fact that it's stolen or lost property gives the original owner or victim the right to reclaim it under Article 193, potentially invalidating the juridical act of acquiring rights over this property.

7. (3, 6 | N)
Justification: In this case, the possessor is in good faith and without negligence (factor 3), and the original owner or victim has the right to reclaim the property (factor 6). However, without a transactional act or peaceful and open possession explicitly mentioned, and considering the property might be stolen or lost, the legality of the current possessor's claim is questionable.

8. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves peaceful and open possession (factor 1) and the acquisition of rights over movables (factor 4). Assuming that other necessary conditions for legal validity are implicitly met or not contradicted by the given factors, this combination supports the legality of acquiring rights over the movables.

9. (2, 5, 7 | N)
Justification: Although initiated through a transactional act (factor 2), the property being stolen or lost (factor 5) and the presence of a time limit for reclaiming (factor 7) suggest that the original owner's rights might supersede those of the current possessor, especially if within the two-year limit. This could invalidate the juridical act based on Article 193.

10. (3, 4, 6 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the possessor is in good faith and without negligence (factor 3), there's an acquisition of rights over movables (factor 4), and the original owner or victim has the right to reclaim the property (factor 6). If the possession was legal and the two-year limit for reclaiming has passed or the current possessor's rights were established in accordance with the law, then despite the property being potentially stolen or lost, the juridical act could be considered legally valid.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors to assess the legality of the juridical act according to Articles 192 and 193.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
1. **Peaceful and Open Possession**: The query does not directly mention how D received the jewelry in terms of it being peaceful and open, but since A stole the jewelry and gave it to D, we can infer that D's possession might not have been openly contested at the moment of transfer. However, given the context (theft), it's complex to assert this factor fully without more details on how D received the jewelry. But for simplicity in assessment: (Query entails 1)
2. **Transactional Act**: The act of A giving the stolen jewelry to D can be considered a transactional act, even though it involves illegal activity. So, (Query entails 2)
3. **Good Faith and Without Negligence**: The query states that D received the jewelry "believing without negligence that it belonged to A," which directly addresses this factor. Thus, (Query entails 3)
4. **Rights Acquisition**: The query does not explicitly discuss D's acquisition of rights over the movables in a legal context but focuses on the return of stolen property. However, since D received the jewelry under certain conditions, we can infer some level of rights discussion: (Query entails 4)
5. **Stolen or Lost Property**: The query clearly involves stolen property, as it mentions A stole the jewelry from B. Therefore, (Query entails 5)
6. **Right to Reclaim**: The query specifies that B may demand the return of the jewelry from D, which aligns with this factor. So, (Query entails 6)
7. **Time Limit for Reclaiming**: The query mentions that B may demand the return within two years from the time of the theft, directly referencing this factor. Hence, (Query entails 7)

### Task 2:
Given the information provided in the query and comparing it against the factors derived from Articles 192 and 193, the scenario described aligns with the legal principles outlined. Specifically, Article 193 allows the original owner (or victim) to demand the return of stolen property within two years, which is exactly what B is doing according to the query. Therefore, based on the provided legal framework, the actions described in the query are legally valid because they follow the rules for reclaiming stolen property as outlined in Article 193.

The final answer is: (Query Valid)

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a sentence given Article 200, we first need to factor the provided article into its core components or factors. The article discusses the rights of a possessor who has been forcibly dispossessed, specifically their right to demand restitution and compensation.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Forcible Dispossession**: The act of taking possession away from someone by force.
2. **Right to Restitution**: The possessor's legal right to have the thing returned.
3. **Right to Compensation**: The possessor's legal right to receive payment for any loss or damage incurred due to the dispossession.
4. **Action for Recovery of Possession**: A legal action that can be filed by the possessor to reclaim possession and seek compensation.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we analyze the query: "If a person's property is taken without their consent, can they claim for its return and any damages?"

This query logically follows from the article because it directly references the concepts of forcible dispossession (Factor 1), the right to restitution (Factor 2), and the right to compensation (Factor 3), all of which are central to Article 200. The article explicitly states that a possessor who is forcibly dispossessed may demand the restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage, aligning with the query's context.

Therefore, considering the factors extracted from Article 200, the query is legally valid within the context provided. 

The final answer is: Y
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 200, I will generate 10 case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: Forcible dispossession (Factor 1) is a key element that triggers the rights outlined in Article 200. If this factor occurs, the possessor has a legitimate claim for restitution and compensation.

2. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The right to restitution (Factor 2) and the right to compensation (Factor 3) are both essential components of the relief available under Article 200. Together, they form a complete basis for a legally valid claim.

3. (4 | Y) 
Justification: An action for recovery of possession (Factor 4) is the procedural mechanism by which a possessor can enforce their rights under Article 200. If this factor occurs, it indicates that the possessor has taken the necessary legal steps to seek relief.

4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Forcible dispossession (Factor 1) and the right to restitution (Factor 2) are closely related factors. When both occur, they provide a strong basis for a legally valid claim for the return of the thing.

5. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Forcible dispossession (Factor 1) and an action for recovery of possession (Factor 4) are complementary factors. The occurrence of both indicates that the possessor has been forcibly dispossessed and has taken legal action to recover their property.

6. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The right to restitution (Factor 2) and an action for recovery of possession (Factor 4) are both necessary elements of a legally valid claim under Article 200. When both factors occur, they provide a complete basis for relief.

7. (3 | N) 
Justification: While the right to compensation (Factor 3) is an important aspect of Article 200, it is not sufficient on its own to establish a legally valid claim. Without evidence of forcible dispossession or an action for recovery of possession, this factor alone does not provide a basis for relief.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: When all three factors – forcible dispossession (Factor 1), the right to restitution (Factor 2), and the right to compensation (Factor 3) – occur, they provide a comprehensive basis for a legally valid claim under Article 200.

9. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Forcible dispossession (Factor 1) and the right to compensation (Factor 3) are both relevant factors in determining the validity of a claim under Article 200. When both occur, they provide a sufficient basis for relief.

10. (2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of the right to restitution (Factor 2), the right to compensation (Factor 3), and an action for recovery of possession (Factor 4) provides a complete and legally valid basis for a claim under Article 200. This combination covers all necessary elements of relief, including the return of the thing and payment for losses or damages.

======= Query Entaiments:
 For Task 1:

1. (Query entails 1) - The query implies forcible dispossession as B has not returned the copying machine despite the lease agreement termination, which can be seen as taking possession away from A by force of circumstance.
2. (Query entails 2) - The query mentions demanding the return of the copying machine, which directly relates to the right to restitution.
3. (Query entails 3) - Although not explicitly mentioned, demanding the return implies seeking compensation or rectification for the loss incurred due to B's actions, aligning with the right to compensation.
4. (Query entails 4) - The query talks about filing an action for recovery of possession, directly referencing this factor.

For Task 2:

(Query Valid) - The query explicitly states that A may demand the return of the copying machine against B by filing an action for recovery of possession, which indicates that within the context provided (and based on Article 200), the juridical act (or obligation) described in the query is legally valid.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a specific scenario with respect to Article 200, we first need to factor the given article into its constituent parts for better understanding and analysis.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Forced Dispossession**: A possessor can be forcibly dispossessed.
2. **Right to Restitution and Compensation**: The dispossessed has the right to demand restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage through an action for recovery of possession.
3. **Action for Recovery of Possession**: This action can be filed against the person who forcibly took possession.
4. **Limitation on Filing Against Successors**: Generally, an action for recovery of possession cannot be filed against a specific successor of the person who forcibly took possession.
5. **Exception for Knowledgeable Successors**: The limitation does not apply if the successor had knowledge that the original possessor unlawfully took possession.
6. **Definition of Unlawful Possession**: The act of taking possession without legal right or justification is considered unlawful.

### End of Factoring

Given these factors, we can analyze various queries to determine their legal validity based on Article 200. However, since a specific query was not provided in the problem statement, let's consider a hypothetical scenario for illustration purposes:

Query: "Can an action for recovery of possession be filed against a successor who knowingly received the property from someone who had forcibly dispossessed the original owner?"

Based on the factors extracted:
- The query involves **Forced Dispossession** (Factor 1) and the right to file an **Action for Recovery of Possession** (Factor 3).
- It also touches upon the **Exception for Knowledgeable Successors** (Factor 5), implying that the successor had knowledge of the unlawful possession.

Since the query directly relates to scenarios covered by Factors 1, 3, and especially Factor 5, which allows for an action against a knowledgeable successor, it logically follows the legal context provided by Article 200. Therefore, without a specific query in the problem statement but using this hypothetical scenario for demonstration:

The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors of Article 200, we will systematically combine these factors in different ways to assess their legal validity. Here are the scenarios:

1. **Forced Dispossession and Right to Restitution**: (1, 2 | Y)  
Justification: The scenario involves a possessor being forcibly dispossessed (Factor 1) and seeking restitution and compensation (Factor 2), which is directly addressed by Article 200 as a valid legal action.

2. **Action for Recovery of Possession Against Original Taker**: (3 | Y)  
Justification: Filing an action for recovery of possession against the person who forcibly took possession (Factor 3) is explicitly allowed under Article 200, making this action legally valid.

3. **Limitation on Filing Against Successors Without Knowledge**: (4 | N)  
Justification: Generally, an action cannot be filed against a successor without knowledge of the unlawful taking (Factor 4), indicating that such an action would not be legally valid in this context.

4. **Knowledgeable Successor and Forced Dispossession**: (1, 5 | Y)  
Justification: If a successor had knowledge of the forced dispossession (combining Factors 1 and 5), Article 200 allows for an action against such a knowledgeable successor, making this scenario legally valid.

5. **Unlawful Possession and Action for Recovery**: (6, 3 | Y)  
Justification: When possession is taken unlawfully (Factor 6) and the original possessor seeks recovery through legal action (Factor 3), Article 200 supports the legality of such an action, making it valid.

6. **Forced Dispossession, Right to Restitution, and Action for Recovery**: (1, 2, 3 | Y)  
Justification: This combination of factors (1, 2, and 3) directly aligns with the provisions of Article 200, which grants the right to restitution and compensation through an action for recovery after forced dispossession, making this scenario legally valid.

7. **Successor Without Knowledge and Unlawful Possession**: (4, 6 | N)  
Justification: A successor without knowledge of the unlawful possession (combining Factors 4 and 6) cannot be held liable under Article 200's general provision limiting actions against successors without knowledge, making such an action invalid.

8. **Knowledgeable Successor and Limitation on Filing**: (4, 5 | Y)  
Justification: Although there's a general limitation on filing against successors (Factor 4), the exception for knowledgeable successors (Factor 5) applies, making an action against a successor with knowledge of the unlawful taking legally valid.

9. **Forced Dispossession, Unlawful Possession, and Knowledgeable Successor**: (1, 5, 6 | Y)  
Justification: This scenario combines forced dispossession (Factor 1), unlawful possession (Factor 6), and a knowledgeable successor (Factor 5). Article 200's provisions support actions against knowledgeable successors in cases of unlawful taking, making this scenario legally valid.

10. **Right to Restitution, Action for Recovery, and Limitation on Successors**: (2, 3, 4 | N)  
Justification: While the right to restitution and action for recovery (Factors 2 and 3) are valid legal actions under Article 200, the general limitation on filing against successors without knowledge (Factor 4) applies unless an exception is met. Without the factor of a knowledgeable successor or other exceptions, this combination leans towards an invalid action due to the lack of direct applicability to successors without knowledge.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors from Article 200, allowing for a determinate verdict on legal validity based on the article's provisions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement based on Article 200, let's first factor the given article into its core components to understand its implications and then apply this understanding to determine if a hypothetical query logically follows from it.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Possession**: The article refers to a "possessor," indicating that the law is concerned with individuals who have possession of something.
2. **Forcible Dispossession**: The possessor can be forcibly dispossessed, implying an action against their will that results in them losing possession.
3. **Right to Restitution and Compensation**: After being forcibly dispossessed, the possessor has the legal right to demand restitution of the thing (return of the property) and compensation for any loss or damage.
4. **Legal Action for Recovery**: The possessor can file an action for recovery of possession, which is a legal mechanism to enforce their rights under this article.
5. **Loss or Damage**: The law acknowledges that loss or damage might occur during dispossession, for which compensation can be sought.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given the factored components, let's consider a hypothetical query: "A person who was forcibly evicted from their home can seek return of their property and compensation for damages."

This query logically follows from Article 200 because it directly addresses the rights of a possessor after being forcibly dispossessed. The factors that support its validity include:

- **Possession**: The query implies the individual had possession (in this case, of their home).
- **Forcible Dispossession**: Being "forcibly evicted" aligns with the article's condition for seeking restitution and compensation.
- **Right to Restitution and Compensation**: The query mentions seeking return of property and compensation, which directly corresponds to the rights granted by Article 200.
- **Legal Action for Recovery**: While not explicitly mentioned in the query, the context implies that legal action could be part of the process, as outlined in the article.

Therefore, considering these factors, a query about seeking restitution and compensation after forcible dispossession would logically follow from Article 200, making it legally valid within the context provided. The response to such a query would be "Y".
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors described from Article 200, we can generate 10 unique case scenarios to determine the legal validity of each situation. The factors are:

1. **Possession**
2. **Forcible Dispossession**
3. **Right to Restitution and Compensation**
4. **Legal Action for Recovery**
5. **Loss or Damage**

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | Y) - A person who had possession of a property and was forcibly dispossessed can seek legal action, making their claim legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y) - An individual seeking restitution and compensation for loss or damage after being dispossessed has a legally valid claim because it directly aligns with the rights granted by Article 200.

3. (1, 3 | N) - If someone merely had possession but did not experience forcible dispossession and is seeking restitution and compensation, their claim would be invalid without evidence of forced removal or loss.

4. (2, 4 | Y) - A person who was forcibly dispossessed and files a legal action for recovery of possession has a legally valid case because it follows the procedure outlined in Article 200.

5. (1, 5 | N) - Having possession and experiencing loss or damage without forcible dispossession does not automatically grant the right to restitution and compensation under Article 200.

6. (2, 3 | Y) - Being forcibly dispossessed and seeking the right to restitution and compensation directly aligns with Article 200, making such a claim legally valid.

7. (4, 5 | N) - Filing a legal action for recovery and experiencing loss or damage without prior possession or forcible dispossession does not constitute a valid claim under Article 200.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - A person with possession who is forcibly dispossessed and seeks restitution and compensation has a legally valid claim as it covers all primary aspects of Article 200.

9. (1, 4 | N) - Having possession and taking legal action for recovery without experiencing forcible dispossession or seeking restitution/compensation does not fulfill the criteria for a valid claim under Article 200.

10. (2, 3, 5 | Y) - Being forcibly dispossessed, seeking restitution and compensation, and experiencing loss or damage provides a strong basis for a legally valid claim as it encompasses key elements of Article 200.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors to assess the legal validity of claims based on Article 200.

# Task 1:
Given the factors and the query: "A has leased a machine tool owned by A to B, and C stole the machine tool from B within the duration of the lease agreement. In this case, B may file an action for recovery of possession against C independently of A."

Let's assess if the query entails each factor:

1. **Possession**: The query mentions that B had possession of the machine tool (leased from A), so (query entails 1).
2. **Forcible Dispossession**: The machine tool was stolen from B, which implies forcible dispossession, so (query entails 2).
3. **Right to Restitution and Compensation**: The query talks about filing an action for recovery of possession, implying a right to restitution, so (query entails 3).
4. **Legal Action for Recovery**: The query explicitly mentions filing an action for recovery of possession against C, so (query entails 4).
5. **Loss or Damage**: While the query does not explicitly mention loss or damage beyond the theft itself, it's implicit that B suffered a loss (the machine tool), but it doesn't directly address seeking compensation for loss or damage as specified in Article 200, so (query not entails 5).


# Task 2:
Considering Article 200 and its implications on the rights of possessors who are forcibly dispossessed, the query suggests that B has the right to file an action for recovery of possession against C independently of A. This aligns with the principle that a possessor can seek restitution after being forcibly dispossessed, as stated in Article 200. Therefore, based on the information given and the principles outlined in Article 200, (Query Valid).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we need to break down the article into its core components or factors and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question. 

Given Article: 
Article 192 A person that commences the possession of movables peacefully and openly by a transactional act acquires the rights that are exercised with respect to the movables immediately if the person possesses it in good faith and without negligence.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Commencement of Possession**: The act of starting to possess something.
2. **Peaceful and Open Possession**: The manner in which possession is taken, emphasizing lack of conflict or secrecy.
3. **Transactional Act**: An action involving an exchange or transfer.
4. **Acquisition of Rights**: Gaining legal rights over the movables.
5. **Good Faith**: Honesty and sincerity in one's actions and intentions.
6. **Without Negligence**: Absence of careless or irresponsible behavior.
7. **Immediate Acquisition**: The rights are acquired right away.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 7>

To assess the validity of a query against this article, we must consider whether the query aligns with these factors. For instance, if a query suggests that rights can be acquired through violent means or in bad faith, it would contradict factors 2 (Peaceful and Open Possession) and 5 (Good Faith), thus not logically following from the article. Conversely, if a query posits that immediate rights can be acquired over movables through a peaceful transactional act in good faith, it aligns with factors 3 (Transactional Act), 4 (Acquisition of Rights), 5 (Good Faith), and 7 (Immediate Acquisition), indicating it logically follows from the article.

Since there's no specific query provided to evaluate against Article 192, let's create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes: "A person can acquire immediate rights over movables if they possess them peacefully and in good faith."

Given this query:
- It aligns with **Commencement of Possession** (factor 1) as it involves starting possession.
- It matches **Peaceful and Open Possession** (factor 2) by specifying peaceful means.
- It implies a **Transactional Act** (factor 3) if we consider the acquisition process as involving some form of transaction or transfer.
- It directly mentions acquiring rights, aligning with **Acquisition of Rights** (factor 4).
- The mention of "good faith" directly corresponds to factor 5 (**Good Faith**).
- The query doesn't explicitly contradict or support the notion of acting **Without Negligence** (factor 6), but the emphasis on good faith might imply careful consideration.
- It suggests **Immediate Acquisition** (factor 7) of rights.

Given this analysis, the hypothetical query seems to align with the factors outlined in Article 192. Therefore, if we were to evaluate this specific query against the article, the response would be "Y" because it logically follows from the legal context provided by Article 192.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors outlined in Article 192, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - In this scenario, the commencement of possession (factor 1), peaceful and open possession (factor 2), and transactional act (factor 3) all occur, suggesting a legally valid acquisition of rights over movables.

2. (4, 5 | N) - This case involves the acquisition of rights (factor 4) and good faith (factor 5), but lacks other essential factors like peaceful possession or a transactional act, making it invalid.

3. (1, 6 | N) - Although commencement of possession (factor 1) and absence of negligence (factor 6) are present, crucial elements such as peaceful possession, transactional act, and good faith are missing, rendering this scenario invalid.

4. (2, 3, 7 | Y) - The presence of peaceful and open possession (factor 2), transactional act (factor 3), and immediate acquisition (factor 7) supports the validity of acquiring rights over movables in this case.

5. (1, 2, 5 | N) - Despite commencement of possession (factor 1), peaceful and open possession (factor 2), and good faith (factor 5), the absence of a transactional act and other factors makes this scenario invalid.

6. (3, 4, 6 | Y) - The combination of a transactional act (factor 3), acquisition of rights (factor 4), and absence of negligence (factor 6) provides a solid foundation for a legally valid acquisition of rights over movables.

7. (2, 5, 6 | N) - This case lacks the commencement of possession (factor 1) and transactional act (factor 3), which are crucial for acquiring rights, making it invalid despite peaceful and open possession (factor 2), good faith (factor 5), and absence of negligence (factor 6).

8. (1, 4, 7 | Y) - The presence of commencement of possession (factor 1), acquisition of rights (factor 4), and immediate acquisition (factor 7) supports the validity of this scenario, assuming good faith and peaceful means are implied.

9. (3, 5, 7 | Y) - With a transactional act (factor 3), good faith (factor 5), and immediate acquisition (factor 7), this case suggests a valid acquisition of rights over movables, given that peaceful possession and absence of negligence can be inferred.

10. (1, 2, 6, 7 | Y) - This scenario includes commencement of possession (factor 1), peaceful and open possession (factor 2), absence of negligence (factor 6), and immediate acquisition (factor 7), making it a valid case for acquiring rights over movables, assuming a transactional act occurred in good faith.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement with respect to Article 201, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then analyze these factors in relation to the query provided.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Timeframe for Filing Action**: An action for maintenance of possession must be filed during the obstruction or within one year after the obstruction stops.
2. **Exception Due to Construction Work**: If the possessed thing has been damaged due to construction work, there are specific conditions under which the action may not be filed (either one year has passed from when the construction started or the construction has been completed).
3. **Condition for Filing After Obstruction Stops**: The general rule allows for filing within one year after the obstruction stops, unless it falls under the exception related to construction work.
4. **Specific Condition for Construction-Related Damage**: The action cannot be filed if either of two conditions is met regarding construction: one year has passed since construction began, or the construction has been completed.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given that there's no specific query provided to evaluate against these factors directly, let's consider a hypothetical query for illustration purposes:

Query: "Can an action for maintenance of possession be filed two years after the obstruction stopped if it was not related to construction work?"

To determine if this query is legally valid with the context of Article 201:

- **Factor 1 (Timeframe for Filing Action)** and **Factor 3 (Condition for Filing After Obstruction Stops)** indicate that actions must be filed within one year after the obstruction stops.
- There's no mention of construction work in the query, so **Factor 2 (Exception Due to Construction Work)** and **Factor 4 (Specific Condition for Construction-Related Damage)** are not directly relevant.

Given these factors, filing an action two years after the obstruction stopped does not align with the timeframe stipulated by Article 201. Therefore, based on the information provided in the article:

The answer would be "N" because the query suggests an action outside the legally defined timeframe for filing such actions when there's no involvement of construction work.

However, please note that without a specific query related to Article 201 provided in your request, this analysis is based on hypothetical application of the factored components.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 201, I'll generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:


1. (1 | N) 
Justification: The action for maintenance of possession was filed two years after the obstruction stopped, which exceeds the one-year timeframe specified in Factor 1.


2. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The possessed thing was damaged due to construction work, and both conditions for not filing are met (one year has passed since construction began, and the construction is completed), as per Factors 2 and 4.


3. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The action for maintenance of possession was filed within one year after the obstruction stopped, adhering to the timeframe specified in Factors 1 and 3.


4. (2 | N) 
Justification: The possessed thing was damaged due to construction work, but the query doesn't specify whether the conditions for not filing are met; however, Factor 2 introduces an exception that could potentially invalidate the action.


5. (4 | N) 
Justification: One year has passed since the construction began, or the construction has been completed, triggering the condition that prevents the action from being filed, as per Factor 4.


6. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Although the possessed thing was damaged due to construction work (Factor 2), the action was filed within one year after the obstruction stopped (Factor 1), which takes precedence in this scenario.


7. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: The action was filed after the one-year period following the obstruction's stoppage (Factor 3), and the construction-related conditions for not filing are met (Factor 4), rendering the action invalid.


8. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Despite filing within one year after the obstruction stopped (Factor 1), the construction-related condition of one year passing since construction began (Factor 4) takes precedence and invalidates the action.


9. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Although the possessed thing was damaged due to construction work (Factor 2), and there's a condition for filing after obstruction stops (Factor 3), the query doesn't specify that both conditions for not filing are met; hence, the action could still be valid.


10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Given that all factors are present, including construction-related damage and the conditions for not filing being met (Factors 2 and 4), along with the general timeframe for filing (Factors 1 and 3), the action is most likely invalid due to the construction-related exceptions taking precedence.

B, who owned neighboring land, began to construct a fence on A's land crossing the boundary without A's consent, and two years later the fence was completed. As of this time, A may not demand the removal of the fence against B by filing an action for maintenance of possession."

1. **Timeframe for Filing Action**: The query involves a timeframe (two years after the fence was completed), which relates to when actions can be filed.
   - (Query entails 1)

2. **Exception Due to Construction Work**: The query mentions construction work (fence construction), which is directly related to this factor.
   - (Query entails 2)

3. **Condition for Filing After Obstruction Stops**: Since the fence's completion indicates the end of the obstruction (construction), and A is considering action after this point, it relates to filing after the obstruction stops.
   - (Query entails 3)

4. **Specific Condition for Construction-Related Damage**: The query involves construction work (the fence) and implies damage or alteration to A's property due to this construction, fitting this factor.
   - (Query entails 4)


### Task 2:
Given the query, it explicitly states that "A may not demand the removal of the fence against B by filing an action for maintenance of possession" after two years. This statement directly implies that, under the given circumstances, A's potential legal action for demanding the removal of the fence (an action for maintenance of possession) would be legally invalid due to the timeframe and nature of the obstruction (construction work).

 To analyze the given query and determine its legal validity with the context of Article 268, let's break down the information provided into key factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Duration of Superficies Not Fixed**: The duration of superficies (a right to use someone else's property for a specific purpose) is not specified by the act that established it.
2. **Absence of Relevant Customs**: There are no customs relevant to determining the duration or terms of the superficies.
3. **Right to Waive**: The superficiary has the right to waive their interest at any time.
4. **Notice Requirement for Rent Payment**: If rent must be paid, the superficiary is required to give notice one year or more in advance to terminate the agreement without penalty.
5. **Alternative to Notice: Rent Payment**: Alternatively, the superficiary can pay rent for one year that has not yet become due and payable as a condition to waive their right immediately.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we need to assess whether the query (not explicitly provided) would logically follow from the context of Article 268. However, since the specific query is missing from your request, I'll address a hypothetical scenario based on common inquiries related to such legal articles.

- **Query Hypothesis**: "Can a superficiary terminate their interest in a property without giving notice if no rent is due?"
  
Given this hypothetical query:

- The article specifies that if rent must be paid, the superficiary has conditions to follow (notice or payment) to waive their right. 
- It implies flexibility in termination if there are no such obligations like rent.

Therefore, based on Article 268 and assuming a scenario where the query is about terminating the superficies without notice when no rent is due, **the answer would be "Y"** because the article does not explicitly state that notice or alternative conditions apply when there's no rent to be paid, suggesting flexibility in such cases.

Please provide the actual query for a more precise analysis.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 268, I'll generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The duration of superficies is not fixed and there are no relevant customs. According to the article, in such cases, the superficiary may waive their right at any time, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The superficiary has the right to waive their interest and can pay rent for one year that has not yet become due and payable as a condition to waive their right immediately. This combination of factors does not contradict any conditions in Article 268, making the juridical act legally valid.

3. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: The duration of superficies is not fixed, but if rent must be paid, giving notice one year or more in advance is required to terminate the agreement without penalty. Without paying rent for a future period or following the notice requirement, waiving the right would be invalid.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The absence of relevant customs and the superficiary's right to waive their interest at any time do not impose additional requirements that would invalidate the juridical act. Therefore, it is legally valid.

5. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Even with all these factors present—duration not fixed, no relevant customs, and the superficiary's right to waive their interest—the article does not introduce conditions that would make the act invalid. Thus, the juridical act remains legally valid.

6. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If rent must be paid, both giving notice one year or more in advance and paying rent for one year that has not yet become due and payable are alternatives to waive the right. Combining these factors indicates an intention to follow the conditions set by Article 268, making the act legally valid.

7. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The absence of relevant customs does not eliminate the requirement for notice if rent must be paid. Without the superficiary's right to waive explicitly mentioned or an alternative payment condition met, the act could be considered invalid due to lack of adherence to specified conditions.

8. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Even though the duration is not fixed, paying rent for one year that has not yet become due and payable as a condition to waive the right immediately aligns with Article 268's provisions for terminating the agreement, making the act legally valid.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: While the superficiary has the right to waive their interest, if rent must be paid, failing to give notice one year or more in advance without an alternative arrangement (like paying rent for a future period) could render the waiver invalid due to non-compliance with specified conditions.

10. (1, 2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The combination of an unspecified duration, absence of customs, and the requirement for notice if rent is paid creates a scenario where simply waiving the right without adhering to the notice or alternative payment condition would be invalid according to Article 268's stipulations.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 268, ensuring that no two cases are the same, and provides a clear justification for whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 1
The query states that "The duration of agreed superficies must be fixed within a duration of 20 years or more but not more than 50 years." This directly pertains to the specification of the duration of superficies, which is the first factor. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 2
The query does not mention anything about customs relevant to determining the duration or terms of the superficies. Hence, it does not directly relate to the absence of relevant customs. So, (Query not entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 3
The query discusses the duration of superficies but does not explicitly mention the right to waive that right at any time. Thus, (Query not entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 4
There's no mention of notice requirements for rent payment in the query. Therefore, (Query not entails 4).

## Step 5: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 5
Similar to factor 4, there's no mention of paying rent for one year that has not yet become due and payable as an alternative to notice. Hence, (Query not entails 5).

## Step 6: Evaluating Query Validity
The query imposes a specific duration on the superficies (between 20 to 50 years), which is not explicitly mentioned in Article 268 as a requirement for all superficies agreements. Article 268 discusses the flexibility of terminating the superficies if its duration is not fixed and there are no relevant customs, with conditions related to rent payment. It does not dictate a specific range for the duration of superficies as the query suggests. Therefore, based on the information given in Article 268, the query's requirement seems to introduce a condition (specific duration range) not explicitly stated in the article. This implies that the query might be trying to impose additional constraints not covered by Article 268 directly. Hence, considering the context provided, (Query Invalid).

 To address the query regarding Article 265 and its relation to a superficiary's rights, let's break down the information provided into key factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Definition of Superficiary**: A superficiary has the right to use another person's land.
2. **Purpose of Use**: The purpose is to own structures, trees, or bamboo on that land.
3. **Ownership and Usage Rights**: The article implies a distinction between owning the land and having rights over specific entities (structures, trees, bamboo) on it.
4. **Legal Right**: The superficiary's right is legally recognized as per Article 265.

Given these factors, we can analyze the query's validity in relation to Article 265. However, since the specific query related to Article 265 isn't provided in your explanation, I'll proceed with a general assessment based on typical queries that might arise from such an article.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Without a specific query to evaluate against Article 265, we must consider what would typically make a query valid or invalid:
- **Validity (Y)**: A query is valid if it aligns with the rights and purposes outlined for a superficiary in Article 265. For example, asking if a superficiary can plant trees on leased land would be valid because it directly pertains to their defined rights.
- **Invalidity (N)**: A query would be invalid if it contradicts or does not logically follow from the article's provisions. For instance, asking if a superficiary automatically owns the land after a certain period might be invalid as it does not align with the basic premise of being a superficiary.

Given this framework and without a specific query to assess, any determination would depend on how closely the query aligns with or deviates from the factors outlined in Article 265 regarding superficiaries' rights and purposes.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 265, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of these factors has occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1 | Y)
Justification: If only the definition of a superficiary (factor 1) is considered, where a superficiary has the right to use another person's land, this alone does not contradict any aspect of Article 265. Thus, the act of being a superficiary in itself is legally valid.

2. (2 | N)
Justification: Considering only the purpose of use (factor 2), which is to own structures, trees, or bamboo on the land, without recognizing the right to use another person's land, does not align with Article 265's premise. This factor alone does not establish a legal basis for the superficiary's actions.

3. (3 | Y)
Justification: The distinction between owning the land and having rights over specific entities (factor 3) is a fundamental aspect of what makes a superficiary's position legally recognized under Article 265. Recognizing this distinction supports the validity of superficiary arrangements.

4. (4 | Y)
Justification: If the legal right (factor 4) of a superficiary as per Article 265 is acknowledged, then any actions taken in accordance with this right are considered legally valid. This factor directly supports the legitimacy of a superficiary's claims and actions.

5. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Combining the definition of a superficiary (factor 1) with the purpose of use (factor 2) provides a clear understanding of what a superficiary is and what they aim to achieve. This combination aligns well with Article 265's provisions, making such an arrangement legally valid.

6. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: When considering both the definition of a superficiary (factor 1) and the distinction between land ownership and rights over entities on the land (factor 3), we see a comprehensive understanding of a superficiary's role. This combination supports the legal validity of superficiary agreements as it respects the boundaries outlined in Article 265.

7. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: The purpose of use (factor 2) combined with the legal right (factor 4) indicates that the superficiary's intentions are not only legally recognized but also specifically aimed at owning structures, trees, or bamboo on someone else's land. This aligns with Article 265 and is therefore considered valid.

8. (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: Recognizing the distinction between land ownership and entity rights (factor 3) alongside the legal right of a superficiary (factor 4) reinforces the legitimacy of their position. This combination respects both the specific rights of the superficiary and the limitations imposed by Article 265, making it legally valid.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Combining the definition of a superficiary (factor 1), the purpose of use (factor 2), and the distinction between land ownership and entity rights (factor 3) provides a complete picture of a superficiary's role and rights. This comprehensive understanding aligns with Article 265, making such arrangements legally valid.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: When all factors are considered - the definition of a superficiary, the purpose of use, the distinction between land ownership and entity rights, and the legal right as per Article 265 - we have a scenario that fully encapsulates the provisions and intentions of Article 265. This comprehensive alignment makes any actions or agreements based on these factors legally valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors to assess the legal validity of a superficiary's position or actions according to Article 265, ensuring no two cases use the same combination of factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1
The query states "Superficies are the rights to use a land in order to own structures, or trees or bamboo." This directly aligns with the definition of a superficiary having the right to use another person's land. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2
The query mentions "to own structures, or trees or bamboo," which matches the purpose outlined for a superficiary. Hence, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3
The distinction between owning the land and having rights over specific entities on it is implicit in the query's definition of superficies. Thus, (Query entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4
The query does not explicitly mention that these rights are legally recognized as per Article 265. It simply states what superficies are without referencing legal recognition or validity directly from Article 265. So, (Query not entails 4).

## Step 5: Evaluating Query Validity
Given the information provided and the assessments above, the query does not explicitly determine the legal validity of the juridical acts or obligations concerning superficies as per Article 265. It merely states what superficies are without referencing their legal status directly from the article. Therefore, (Query Invalid).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

 To evaluate the query's validity with respect to Article 269-2, let's break down the information into key factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Subject Matter Establishment**: An underground space or airspace can be established as the subject matter of superficies for ownership of structures.
2. **Specification Requirement**: The establishment requires the specification of upper and lower extents.
3. **Use Restrictions Allowance**: Restrictions on the use of that land may be added to facilitate the exercise of the superficies.
4. **Ownership Structures**: The superficies is specifically for the ownership of structures within the specified space.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we need a query to evaluate its validity against Article 269-2.


Please provide the query related to Article 269-2 so I can assess whether it logically follows from the given legal context and respond with "Y" if valid or "N" if not, along with an explanation.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 269-2, I will generate 10 case scenarios to evaluate their validity against the given legal context.

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The establishment of an underground space as the subject matter of superficies for ownership of structures with specified upper and lower extents is a direct application of Article 269-2, making it legally valid.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: Adding restrictions on the use of land without establishing superficies or specifying upper and lower extents does not align with Article 269-2's requirements for creating a valid superficies, thus it is invalid.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Establishing an underground space as the subject matter of superficies specifically for the ownership of structures directly follows Article 269-2's purpose, making it legally valid even without specifying upper and lower extents or adding use restrictions.

4. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Specifying upper and lower extents and adding restrictions on land use does not establish a valid superficies under Article 269-2 if the subject matter of superficies is not clearly defined as an underground space or airspace for structure ownership.

5. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This combination fully aligns with Article 269-2 by establishing an underground space or airspace as the subject matter of superficies, specifying upper and lower extents, and adding use restrictions to facilitate the exercise of superficies, making it legally valid.

6. (4 | N) 
Justification: Simply stating that the superficies is for the ownership of structures without establishing the subject matter as an underground space or airspace and without specifying upper and lower extents does not meet Article 269-2's criteria for a valid establishment of superficies.

7. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Establishing an underground space or airspace as the subject matter of superficies and adding restrictions on land use to facilitate the exercise of superficies can be considered legally valid under Article 269-2, even if upper and lower extents are not specified, as it partially aligns with the article's provisions.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Specifying upper and lower extents for an underground space or airspace established for the ownership of structures aligns with key aspects of Article 269-2, making this combination legally valid despite lacking the factor of use restrictions.

9. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario combines establishing an underground space as the subject matter of superficies, specifying upper and lower extents, and being for the ownership of structures, which directly aligns with Article 269-2's main provisions, making it legally valid.

10. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Adding restrictions on land use and stating that the superficies is for structure ownership without establishing an underground space or airspace as the subject matter and without specifying upper and lower extents does not fulfill Article 269-2's requirements, thus it is invalid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors to assess validity against Article 269-2.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "An underground space or airspace may be established as the subject matter of superficies for ownership of structures, through the specification of upper and lower extents."

1. **Subject Matter Establishment**: The query directly mentions that an underground space or airspace can be established as the subject matter of superficies for ownership of structures. Therefore, (Query entails 1).
2. **Specification Requirement**: It also specifies that this establishment requires the specification of upper and lower extents. Thus, (Query entails 2).
3. **Use Restrictions Allowance**: The query does not mention anything about restrictions on the use of that land being added to facilitate the exercise of the superficies. Hence, (Query not entails 3).
4. **Ownership Structures**: The query mentions that the superficies is for the ownership of structures, aligning with this factor. So, (Query entails 4).

### Task 2:
Given the query: "An underground space or airspace may be established as the subject matter of superficies for ownership of structures, through the specification of upper and lower extents."

This query essentially restates a part of Article 269-2 without adding any judgment on its validity. It presents a possibility under the law ("may be established") rather than asserting an act's legal validity or invalidity. Therefore, since it does not explicitly express that the juridical acts (or obligations) are legally valid or invalid but merely states what can be done under the law, the most appropriate response is "(Query Valid)" because it aligns with and reflects the content of Article 269-2 without questioning its legal validity.

Answer for Task 1:
(Query entails 1), (Query entails 2), (Query not entails 3), (Query entails 4).

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given sentence with respect to Article 338, we first need to factor the provided article into its key components. This will help in understanding whether the query logically follows from the article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Registration Requirement**: The budgeted expenses for construction work on immovables must be registered before starting the work.
2. **Purpose of Registration**: The registration is to preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work.
3. **Budget Exceedance Condition**: If the actual expenses exceed the registered (budgeted) amount, a statutory lien does not apply to the excess amount.
4. **Statutory Lien Effectiveness**: The existence and effectiveness of a statutory lien are dependent on prior registration of budgeted expenses.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we can analyze the query's validity. However, since the specific query to be validated against Article 338 is not provided in your request, I will create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes: "If the construction costs exceed the budgeted amount registered before commencement, does the statutory lien apply to the full amount of expenses incurred?"

To determine if this query is legally valid with the context of the article:

- The query touches on **Budget Exceedance Condition** and **Statutory Lien Effectiveness**, which are directly addressed by Article 338.
- It implies an understanding of **Registration Requirement** and **Purpose of Registration**, as it discusses the implications of exceeding the registered budget on the statutory lien.

Given this analysis, if we were to respond based on a query like the one hypothesized, the answer would be "Y" because the query directly relates to conditions outlined in Article 338 regarding the application of statutory liens when construction expenses exceed the pre-registered budget. The article explicitly states that a statutory lien does not exist for amounts exceeding the registered budget, making the query logically follow from the legal context provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 338, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The registration of budgeted expenses for construction work on immovables before starting the work is a requirement to preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens. If this registration is done along with understanding its purpose, then the juridical act of registering these expenses is legally valid.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: If only the condition of budget exceedance is considered without prior registration or understanding the purpose and effectiveness of statutory liens, the obligations arising from exceeding the budget would not be legally valid due to lack of initial compliance with registration requirements.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When budgeted expenses are registered before construction begins, and there's an understanding that the existence and effectiveness of a statutory lien depend on this prior registration, then any obligations stemming from this process are legally valid because they adhere to the necessary conditions for statutory lien effectiveness.

4. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Knowing the purpose of registration and being aware of the budget exceedance condition without actually registering the budgeted expenses before starting work does not make the juridical act legally valid. The absence of prior registration negates the legal validity of any obligations arising from these conditions.

5. (4 | Y) 
Justification: If there's an understanding that the existence and effectiveness of a statutory lien are dependent on prior registration of budgeted expenses, then this understanding alone can imply a legal validity to the process of applying for or relying on such liens, assuming all other factors align with legal requirements.

6. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The mere act of registering budgeted expenses before starting construction work, as required by law, implies that the initial step towards ensuring the effectiveness of statutory liens has been taken, thus lending legal validity to this action alone.

7. (2 | N) 
Justification: Understanding the purpose of registration without actually registering or considering other critical factors like budget exceedance and lien effectiveness does not provide a basis for legal validity regarding obligations related to statutory liens.

8. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: If budgeted expenses are registered before construction starts, and there's an awareness that exceeding the budget affects the statutory lien, then any resulting obligations from this process would be legally valid because they are based on both a required action (registration) and an understanding of its implications.

9. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When there's an understanding of the purpose of registration and how it impacts the effectiveness of statutory liens, then any juridical acts or obligations stemming from this understanding would be considered legally valid because they demonstrate compliance with the intent behind the legal requirements for construction work on immovables.

10. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Being aware of the budget exceedance condition and its impact on statutory lien effectiveness without having registered the budgeted expenses initially does not provide a basis for legal validity regarding any obligations arising from these conditions, as it misses the crucial step of prior registration.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we need to break down the article into its key components or factors and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Mortgage Extinction**: A mortgage is not extinguished by prescription.
2. **Relation to Obligors and Mortgagors**: This rule applies unless the mortgage is extinguished simultaneously with the claim it secures, specifically in relation to obligors (those who owe something) and mortgagors (those who give a mortgage).
3. **Simultaneous Extinction Requirement**: For a mortgage to be extinguished by prescription, it must happen at the same time as the extinction of the claim it secures.
4. **Prescription Concept**: Prescription refers to the process by which rights, including claims and mortgages, can become nullified or unenforceable due to the passage of time without being exercised.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we need a query to assess its validity against the context provided by Article 396. Without a specific query, it's not possible to determine if it logically follows from the article or not. However, I can provide guidance on how one might approach this:

- If the query suggests that a mortgage can be extinguished without simultaneously extinguishing the claim it secures (contrary to factor 3), it would likely not validate against Article 396.
- If the query posits that obligors and mortgagors are affected differently by prescription in terms of mortgage extinction, in a manner consistent with factors 1 and 2, then it could potentially be valid.

Please provide a specific query related to Article 396 for a more precise determination.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 396, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios to determine the validity of the juridical act (or obligations) in each situation.

1. **(1 | N)**: Only factor 1 is present, indicating a mortgage is not extinguished by prescription. However, without considering the relation to obligors and mortgagors or the simultaneous extinction requirement, we cannot conclude the mortgage remains valid in all contexts, making this scenario invalid due to lack of comprehensive consideration.

2. **(2 | N)**: Factor 2 is present, focusing on the relationship with obligors and mortgagors but lacking information on how prescription affects the mortgage's validity directly. This omission leads to an invalid conclusion since we cannot assess the full impact without considering prescription or simultaneous extinction.

3. **(3 | Y)**: With factor 3 present, indicating that for a mortgage to be extinguished by prescription it must happen simultaneously with the claim it secures, this scenario suggests a clear condition under which a mortgage could be considered valid—it has not been extinguished prematurely without its secured claim being resolved.

4. **(4 | N)**: Factor 4 alone discusses the concept of prescription but does not provide enough context to determine the validity of a specific juridical act related to mortgages. Prescription's general principle doesn't inherently validate or invalidate a mortgage without considering how it applies to the mortgage in question.

5. **(1, 2 | N)**: Factors 1 and 2 are present, indicating a mortgage isn't extinguished by prescription and its relation to obligors and mortgagors. However, lacking factor 3, we cannot confirm if the extinction of the claim was simultaneous, making it uncertain whether the mortgage remains valid under these conditions.

6. **(1, 4 | Y)**: With factors 1 and 4 present, we understand that a mortgage isn't extinguished by prescription (factor 1) and we're considering the concept of prescription (factor 4). This suggests that as long as the prescription period hasn't led to the extinction of the claim (and by extension potentially the mortgage), the juridical act could remain valid.

7. **(2, 3 | Y)**: Factors 2 and 3 are present, indicating consideration for obligors and mortgagors and the requirement for simultaneous extinction of the mortgage with its secured claim. This scenario suggests a comprehensive approach to determining validity, as it considers both the relationship between parties involved and the timing of any potential extinguishment.

8. **(2, 4 | N)**: With factors 2 and 4 present, focusing on obligors/mortgagors and prescription, but lacking the crucial factor of simultaneous extinction (factor 3), we cannot definitively conclude the juridical act's validity without knowing if any extinguishment was properly timed with the claim's resolution.

9. **(1, 2, 4 | N)**: Factors 1, 2, and 4 are considered, providing a broad understanding of mortgage extinction by prescription, its relation to obligors and mortgagors, and the concept of prescription. However, without factor 3 (simultaneous extinction requirement), this combination still lacks critical information necessary for determining validity in all scenarios.

10. **(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)**: All factors are present, offering a complete picture: a mortgage isn't extinguished by prescription unless it's with the claim it secures (factor 1 and 3), considering obligors and mortgagors (factor 2), and understanding prescription's role (factor 4). This comprehensive scenario provides all necessary elements to determine that a juridical act related to mortgages is valid, given that all conditions for its maintenance or extinction are clearly outlined and considered.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1
The query discusses the extinction of a mortgage through prescription after 20 years, which directly relates to the concept of mortgage extinction. Thus, the query entails factor 1.

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2
The query mentions an obligor (A) and the creation of a mortgage for an obligee (B), indicating a relation to both obligors and mortgagors, as it involves the owner of the real property (mortgagor) and the party to whom the obligation is owed (obligee). Thus, the query entails factor 2.

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3
The query suggests that the mortgage can be extinguished by prescription after 20 years, even if the claim it secures is not extinguished. This directly contradicts the requirement that for a mortgage to be extinguished by prescription, it must happen simultaneously with the extinction of the claim it secures. Thus, the query does not entail factor 3.

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4
The query involves the concept of prescription as a means to extinguish a mortgage, which aligns with the definition of prescription as a process by which rights can become nullified due to the passage of time without being exercised. Thus, the query entails factor 4.

## Step 5: Evaluating Query Validity
Given that the query suggests a scenario (extinction of a mortgage by prescription without simultaneously extinguishing the claim it secures) that contradicts the requirements outlined in Article 396, specifically factor 3, the query is invalid according to the article's stipulations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement based on the provided articles, let's break down the information into key factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Definition of Revolving Mortgagee Rights**: A revolving mortgagee has specific rights and limitations before the principal is crystallized.
2. **Limitation on Disposal**: Before the principal is crystallized, a revolving mortgagee may not dispose of a revolving mortgage under Article 376(1), but there's an exception for applying it to secure other claims.
3. **Exception for Securing Other Claims**: The revolving mortgagee can apply the mortgage to secure other claims even before the principal is crystallized.
4. **Non-Applicability of Article 377(2)**: Payments made before crystallization, in cases where the mortgage secures other claims, do not follow the provisions of Article 377(2).
5. **General Disposition Rights of Mortgagee**: A mortgagee can apply a mortgage to secure other claims, assign, waive the mortgage, or change its order of priority for the benefit of other obligees.
6. **Order of Priority in Disposition**: When a mortgage is disposed of for the benefit of multiple persons, their rights' order of priority follows the chronological order of supplemental registration.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 6>

Given these factors and without a specific query to evaluate against them, it's essential to note that any question regarding the disposal of revolving mortgages before crystallization, the application of such mortgages to secure other claims, or the order of priority in disposition should be evaluated against these factors. The legal validity of a statement would depend on whether it aligns with these established rules and exceptions regarding revolving mortgages and their disposition.

For instance, if a query states that "a revolving mortgagee can dispose of a revolving mortgage under Article 376(1) before the principal is crystallized without any restrictions," this would be considered invalid (N) because it contradicts factor 2, which explicitly states there's a limitation on such disposal before crystallization.

However, if a query asserts that "a revolving mortgagee can apply the revolving mortgage to secure other claims before the principal is crystallized," this would be valid (Y) as it aligns with factor 3, which allows for such application as an exception. 

Please provide the specific query you'd like evaluated against these factors for a direct assessment of its legal validity based on the articles provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 10 case scenarios to evaluate their legal validity according to the articles.


1. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: This case involves a revolving mortgagee attempting to dispose of a revolving mortgage under Article 376(1) before the principal is crystallized without any exception for securing other claims. Given factor 2's limitation on disposal before crystallization, this action would be invalid.


2. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: In this scenario, a revolving mortgagee applies the mortgage to secure other claims (factor 3) and exercises general disposition rights as a mortgagee (factor 5). Since factor 3 is an exception allowed by the articles and factor 5 outlines standard mortgagee rights, this action would be legally valid.


3. (4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: This case involves payments made before crystallization in cases where the mortgage secures other claims (factor 4), and the order of priority in disposition for multiple persons is considered (factor 6). Given that factor 4 stipulates non-applicability of Article 377(2) under specific conditions, which does not inherently invalidate the action, and factor 6 provides a clear method for determining priority, this scenario aligns with the articles' provisions.


4. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Here, a revolving mortgagee's rights are defined (factor 1), and the exception for applying the mortgage to secure other claims before crystallization is invoked (factor 3). Since factor 3 explicitly allows for such an application as an exception to the general rule, this action would be considered legally valid.


5. (2, 5, 6 | N) 
Justification: In this case, a revolving mortgagee attempts to dispose of a revolving mortgage under Article 376(1) before crystallization without securing other claims (factor 2), exercises general disposition rights as a mortgagee (factor 5), and considers the order of priority in disposition for multiple persons (factor 6). The presence of factor 2, which limits disposal before crystallization, makes this scenario invalid despite the additional factors.


6. (4 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario involves payments made before crystallization where Article 377(2) does not apply (factor 4). Since factor 4 itself stipulates an exception under specific conditions without indicating an inherent invalidity of the action, this would be considered legally valid in the context provided.


7. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Here, a revolving mortgagee's rights are defined (factor 1), and general disposition rights as a mortgagee are exercised (factor 5). Given that factor 5 outlines standard and legal actions a mortgagee can take, this scenario would be legally valid.


8. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: This case involves the limitation on disposing of a revolving mortgage before crystallization (factor 2) and payments made under conditions where Article 377(2) does not apply (factor 4). The presence of factor 2 restricts disposal before crystallization, making this action invalid.


9. (3, 6 | Y) 
Justification: In this scenario, a revolving mortgagee applies the mortgage to secure other claims before crystallization (factor 3), and there's consideration for the order of priority in disposition among multiple persons (factor 6). Since factor 3 is an allowed exception and factor 6 provides a method for determining priority without indicating invalidity, this action would be legally valid.


10. (1, 2, 5 | N) 
Justification: This case combines the definition of revolving mortgagee rights (factor 1), the limitation on disposal before crystallization (factor 2), and the exercise of general disposition rights as a mortgagee (factor 5). The restrictive nature of factor 2 regarding disposal before crystallization, despite the other factors, renders this scenario invalid.


Each case presents a unique combination of factors to assess legal validity according to the provided articles.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Evaluate Query Against Factors for Task 1
To determine whether the query entails any of the factors, we must analyze each factor in relation to the query. The query states that an obligee (B) may assign the order of priority of a mortgage to another obligee (C) of obligator (A) before the principal is crystallized.

## Step 2: Analyze Factor 1
Factor 1 discusses the definition of revolving mortgagee rights, which isn't directly relevant to assigning the order of priority.

## Step 3: Analyze Factor 2
Factor 2 mentions a limitation on disposing of a revolving mortgage before the principal is crystallized but doesn't directly address assigning the order of priority.

## Step 4: Analyze Factor 3
Factor 3 talks about applying a mortgage to secure other claims, which is not exactly what the query is about.

## Step 5: Analyze Factor 4
Factor 4 refers to payments made before crystallization and the non-applicability of Article 377(2), which doesn't directly relate to assigning priority.

## Step 6: Analyze Factor 5
Factor 5 discusses general disposition rights, including applying a mortgage to secure other claims, assigning, waiving, or changing its order of priority for other obligees. This factor is relevant because it mentions changing the order of priority.

## Step 7: Analyze Factor 6
Factor 6 explains that when a mortgage is disposed of for multiple persons, their rights follow the chronological order of supplemental registration, which indirectly relates to priority but is more about the outcome of disposition rather than the act of assigning priority itself.

## Step 8: Conclusion for Task 1
Based on the analysis, the query most closely aligns with Factor 5 because it involves changing the order of priority, a form of disposition right. Thus, (Query entails 5).

## Step 9: Evaluate Query Validity for Task 2
For Task 2, we need to assess whether the query explicitly states that the juridical act is legally valid or invalid based on the provided articles.

## Step 10: Analysis of Query Validity
Article 376(1) allows a mortgagee to apply the mortgage to secure other claims, assign, waive the mortgage, or change its order of priority for the benefit of other obligees. The query specifically mentions assigning the order of priority before the principal is crystallized, which aligns with the general rights provided in Article 376(1) and factor 5.

## Step 11: Conclusion for Task 2
Given that the query's action (assigning the order of priority) is within the rights described in Article 376(1), as interpreted through Factor 5, we conclude that the query describes a legally valid action. Thus, (Query Valid).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 5)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context of the given articles, we must first factor the relevant information into key points or factors. These factors will help us understand the legal framework provided and assess whether the query aligns with this framework.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Revolving Mortgage Principal Secured Crystallization**: The date for crystallizing the principal secured by a revolving mortgage can be specified or changed, as per Article 398-6(1).
2. **Application of Article 398-4**: The provisions of Article 398-4, paragraph (2), apply to changes in the crystallization date of a revolving mortgage's principal, indicating that approval from third parties, including subordinated mortgagees, is not required for certain changes.
3. **Time Limit for Crystallization Date**: The specified or changed date for crystallizing the principal must be within five years of the day when the date was prescribed or changed, as stated in Article 398-6(3).
4. **Consequences of Late Registration**: If registration regarding a change in the crystallization date is not effected before the originally specified date, the principal secured is crystallized on that original date, according to Article 398-6(4).
5. **Scope and Obligor Changes**: The scope of claims secured by a revolving mortgage and the obligors can be changed if these changes are made before the principal is crystallized, as per Article 398-4(1).
6. **Registration Requirement for Changes**: For changes in the scope or obligors to be effective, they must be registered before the principal is crystallized; otherwise, it is deemed that no change occurred, as stated in Article 398-4(3).

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 6>

Given these factors and without a specific query provided to evaluate against them, I will explain how one might approach determining legal validity:

- **Query Alignment**: A query would be considered legally valid (Y) if it aligns with the principles outlined in these factors. For example, stating that changes to the scope of claims or obligors in a revolving mortgage do not require third-party approval before the principal is crystallized would be consistent with Article 398-4.
  
- **Query Misalignment**: Conversely, a query suggesting that the crystallization date of a revolving mortgage's principal can be changed without any time limit or that late registration of changes does not result in crystallization on the original date would be considered legally invalid (N), as it contradicts the specifics outlined in Article 398-6.

Since there is no specific query provided to assess against these factors, I will provide a general response based on the requirement for a hypothetical query evaluation:

Without a specific query to evaluate, any assessment of legal validity would depend on how closely the query aligns with or diverges from the factors outlined above. 

However, since the task requires a choice between Y and N without providing an actual query to assess against the given articles, I must conclude based on the information provided:

Given that there's no direct query to validate or invalidate within the context of the provided legal article, but considering the instructions for response format, it seems most appropriate to demonstrate how one would approach a query by discussing the factors involved. In real scenarios, each query would need to be evaluated against these factors to determine its validity.

For demonstration purposes and without a specific query to evaluate, if we were to consider a generic scenario where a query perfectly aligns with the provided legal context (e.g., discussing changes in revolving mortgage terms without requiring third-party approval before crystallization), the response would logically follow the legal context provided. 

Thus, hypothetically, if a query were perfectly aligned with these principles, the answer would be "Y". However, since no actual query is provided for evaluation against the factors outlined, this explanation serves to illustrate the thought process rather than provide a direct assessment of a specific query's validity.

Therefore, without an explicit query to assess and based on the structure of your request, I'm constrained to provide a response that reflects the process of evaluation rather than a definitive Y or N regarding a non-existent query.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 398-6 and Article 398-4, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will consider a different combination of factors to determine whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. **Case Scenario:** A revolving mortgage's principal crystallization date is specified within five years of the prescription or change, and the registration regarding this change is completed before the old date.
   - **Factors Involved:** 1, 3
   - **Justification:** Since the crystallization date is within the specified time limit (Article 398-6(3)) and the registration is timely (implying compliance with Article 398-6(4) by not needing to default to the old date), this scenario is legally valid.
   - **Verdict:** (1, 3 | Y)

2. **Case Scenario:** The scope of claims secured by a revolving mortgage is changed after the principal has been crystallized.
   - **Factors Involved:** 5
   - **Justification:** According to Article 398-4(1), changes in the scope can only be made before the principal is crystallized. Since this change occurred after crystallization, it's invalid.
   - **Verdict:** (5 | N)

3. **Case Scenario:** A change in obligors for a revolving mortgage is registered before the principal is crystallized, without needing approval from third parties.
   - **Factors Involved:** 2, 5
   - **Justification:** Article 398-4(1) and (2) allow for changes in obligors before crystallization without requiring third-party approval. Registration before crystallization complies with Article 398-4(3).
   - **Verdict:** (2, 5 | Y)

4. **Case Scenario:** The crystallization date of a revolving mortgage's principal is changed to a date beyond five years from the day the change was prescribed.
   - **Factors Involved:** 1, 3
   - **Justification:** Article 398-6(3) specifies that the new crystallization date must be within five years. Since this condition is not met, the change is invalid.
   - **Verdict:** (1, 3 | N)

5. **Case Scenario:** Registration regarding a change in the scope of claims for a revolving mortgage is not completed before the principal is crystallized.
   - **Factors Involved:** 4, 5
   - **Justification:** According to Article 398-4(3), if registration of changes is not completed before crystallization, it's deemed that no change occurred. Thus, this scenario is invalid due to lack of timely registration.
   - **Verdict:** (4, 5 | N)

6. **Case Scenario:** The principal secured by a revolving mortgage is crystallized on the original date because registration for a change in the crystallization date was not completed before that date.
   - **Factors Involved:** 1, 4
   - **Justification:** Article 398-6(4) states that if registration of a changed crystallization date is not done before the old date, the principal crystallizes on the old date. This scenario follows the article's provision, making it valid.
   - **Verdict:** (1, 4 | Y)

7. **Case Scenario:** A change in obligors for a revolving mortgage is made and registered after the principal has been crystallized.
   - **Factors Involved:** 2, 5
   - **Justification:** Changes can only be legally recognized if made before crystallization (Article 398-4(1)). Since this change occurred after crystallization, it's invalid regardless of registration.
   - **Verdict:** (2, 5 | N)

8. **Case Scenario:** The scope of claims for a revolving mortgage is changed and registered before the principal is crystallized, with the new crystallization date being within five years from the prescription or change.
   - **Factors Involved:** 1, 3, 5
   - **Justification:** This scenario complies with Article 398-4(1) for scope changes and Article 398-6(3) for the timing of the crystallization date change. Registration before crystallization (implied from compliance with other factors) also supports validity.
   - **Verdict:** (1, 3, 5 | Y)

9. **Case Scenario:** A revolving mortgage's principal crystallization date is changed without attempting to register this change before the original crystallization date.
   - **Factors Involved:** 1, 4
   - **Justification:** Article 398-6(4) implies that failure to register a new crystallization date before the old one results in defaulting to the original crystallization date. However, the act of changing the date itself is not invalid if within the five-year limit (not explicitly stated but implied necessary for consideration).
   - **Verdict:** (1, 4 | Y)

10. **Case Scenario:** The obligors for a revolving mortgage are changed, and this change is registered before the principal is crystallized. However, the new crystallization date is set beyond five years from the prescription or change.
    - **Factors Involved:** 1, 2, 3, 5
    - **Justification:** While the change in obligors and its registration are compliant (Article 398-4(1) and implied compliance with Article 398-4(2)), setting a new crystallization date beyond five years violates Article 398-6(3).
    - **Verdict:** (1, 2, 3, 5 | N)

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors to assess the legal validity of the juridical act based on the articles provided.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given query, let's first factor the provided article into its key components to understand the legal context it establishes.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Impossibility of Performance**: The performance of an obligation can be considered impossible based on the contract or other sources of claims and common sense in transactions.
2. **Obligee's Rights**: The obligee (the party to whom the obligation is owed) may not request the performance of the obligation if it is deemed impossible as per point 1.
3. **Contract Formation Time**: The impossibility of performing an obligation at the time of contract formation does not automatically negate claims for compensation due to the impossibility.
4. **Compensation Claims**: Despite impossibility, claims for loss or damage arising from this impossibility can be pursued under Article 415.
5. **Article 415 Reference**: There's a specific mention of Article 415 regarding provisions for claiming compensation for loss or damage due to impossibility.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given the query is not explicitly provided, I'll address the task based on determining the validity of potential queries against the factored context.


For a query to be legally valid within this context, it must align with one or more of these factors without contradicting them. For instance, a query stating that an obligee cannot demand performance of an impossible obligation would be valid (Y), as it directly aligns with factor 2.


However, if a query suggests that impossibility at the time of contract formation automatically precludes any form of compensation claim, it would be invalid (N) because it contradicts factors 3 and 4, which allow for compensation claims despite initial impossibility.


Without a specific query to evaluate against these factors, the approach remains speculative. Nonetheless, by factoring the article into its constituent parts, we can systematically assess any query's validity against the established legal context.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 412-2, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:


1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: If the performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the contract or other sources of claims and common sense in transactions, then it's legally valid to acknowledge this impossibility.


2. (2 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee may not request the performance of the obligation if it is deemed impossible, making this scenario legally valid.


3. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: If an obligation is impossible and the obligee cannot demand its performance, then both factors align to render the situation legally valid.


4. (3 | N) 
Justification: If impossibility at the time of contract formation automatically precluded any compensation claims without further context, it would contradict the allowance for such claims under Article 415, making this scenario invalid as per the given article.


5. (4 | Y) 
Justification: Claims for loss or damage arising from the impossibility of an obligation can indeed be pursued, making this a legally valid scenario.


6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Even if an obligation was impossible at the time of contract formation, the fact that it's impossible does not preclude claiming compensation, rendering this combination legally valid.


7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee cannot demand performance of an impossible obligation, and claims for loss or damage due to this impossibility can be made, making this scenario legally valid.


8. (5 | Y) 
Justification: The reference to Article 415 for provisions on claiming compensation for loss or damage due to impossibility is a clear legal pathway, making this scenario valid.


9. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Recognizing the impossibility of an obligation and allowing claims for losses arising from it aligns with the principles outlined, making this combination legally valid.


10. (2, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee cannot demand performance of an impossible obligation, impossibility at contract formation does not preclude compensation claims, and Article 415 provides a basis for such claims, rendering this complex scenario legally valid.


Each case presents a unique combination of factors to determine the legal validity of the juridical act or obligations based on Article 412-2.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1 Assessment
Given the query "The contract for sale does not become effective in the case where X is burned down the day before the day of the conclusion of the contract," let's assess if it entails any of the factors:

- **Factor 1 (Impossibility of Performance):** The scenario implies that an event (X being burned down) affects the contract's effectiveness, suggesting an impossibility in performing the contract as intended. Therefore, (Query entails 1).
- **Factor 2 (Obligee's Rights):** There is no direct mention of what the obligee can or cannot request in terms of performance, so we cannot conclusively say it directly entails this factor based on the given query.
- **Factor 3 (Contract Formation Time):** The query mentions an event happening before the conclusion of the contract, which aligns with the concept of impossibility at the time of contract formation. Hence, (Query entails 3).
- **Factor 4 (Compensation Claims):** There is no mention of claims for compensation in the query, so it does not directly entail this factor.
- **Factor 5 (Article 415 Reference):** The query does not reference Article 415 or any provisions regarding compensation due to impossibility. Thus, it does not entail this factor.

### Task 2 Assessment
The query suggests that under certain conditions (X being burned down before the contract conclusion), "The contract for sale does not become effective." This statement implies a condition under which a juridical act (the contract) is considered legally invalid due to external circumstances. Therefore, since it explicitly determines the legal validity of the juridical act under specific conditions, the assessment is: (Query Invalid).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given problem, let's break down the provided article and query to determine their legal validity within the context.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Impossibility of Performance**: The article discusses a situation where the performance of an obligation becomes impossible.
2. **Acquisition of Substitute Right or Profit**: The obligor acquires a right or profit as a substitute for the subject matter of the obligation due to the same cause that made the performance impossible.
3. **Right to Demand Transfer or Reimbursement**: The obligee has the right to demand the transfer of the acquired right or reimbursement of the profit from the obligor.
4. **Extent of Damage**: The demand is limited to the extent of the amount of damage sustained by the obligee.
5. **Query Context**: The query needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors to determine its legal validity.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that there's no specific query provided to evaluate against the article, let's consider a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes: "Can an obligee demand reimbursement if the obligor gains a profit from an event that also made their obligation impossible?"

Based on the factored elements:
- The article explicitly mentions that if the obligor acquires a right or profit as a substitute due to the same cause that rendered the performance of the obligation impossible, the obligee may demand transfer or reimbursement (Factor 2 and Factor 3).
- This demand is contingent upon the damage sustained by the obligee (Factor 4), implying a direct connection between the gain of the obligor and the loss of the obligee.

Therefore, if we were to evaluate the hypothetical query against these factors, it would logically follow that the obligee has grounds for demanding reimbursement under the conditions outlined in the article. Hence, without a specific query but using this example for illustration:

The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the article and factors provided, here are 10 case scenarios with their respective justifications:


1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: If the performance of an obligation becomes impossible (Factor 1) and the obligor acquires a right or profit as a substitute due to the same cause (Factor 2), it aligns with the conditions under which the obligee may demand transfer or reimbursement, thus the juridical act can be considered legally valid.


2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When the obligee has the right to demand the transfer of the acquired right or reimbursement of the profit (Factor 3), and this demand is limited to the extent of the damage sustained (Factor 4), it follows the article's guidelines for handling such situations, making the juridical act legally valid.


3. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The impossibility of performance (Factor 1) coupled with the obligee's right to demand transfer or reimbursement (Factor 3) directly relates to the core of the article, which aims to protect the obligee's interests in cases where the obligor gains from the same cause that renders the obligation impossible, thus validating the juridical act.


4. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although the acquisition of a substitute right or profit by the obligor due to the same cause (Factor 2) is relevant, without specific details on the query context (Factor 5), it's challenging to ascertain the legal validity directly from these factors alone. However, since Factor 5 is about the query context and not a direct condition for legal validity in this scenario, and given that Factor 2 alone does not guarantee legal validity without considering damage or the right to demand, this combination leans towards being insufficient for automatic validation.


5. (4 | N) 
Justification: The extent of the damage (Factor 4) is crucial but on its own does not determine the legal validity of a juridical act. Without information on the impossibility of performance, acquisition of substitute rights or profits, or the right to demand transfer or reimbursement, it's impossible to conclude the legal validity based solely on this factor.


6. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When the performance is impossible (Factor 1), and there's a consideration for the extent of damage sustained by the obligee (Factor 4), it sets a basis for evaluating the compensatory measures that could be legally valid, as it aligns with the principle of limiting reimbursement to the amount of damage.


7. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The acquisition of a right or profit by the obligor (Factor 2) and the obligee's right to demand its transfer or reimbursement (Factor 3) are directly related and form the core of when such demands can be legally valid, as they address both the gain of the obligor and the potential loss of the obligee.


8. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes the impossibility of performance (Factor 1), the acquisition of a substitute right or profit (Factor 2), and consideration for the extent of damage (Factor 4). It encompasses all necessary elements for determining legal validity under the article, as it covers the cause, the effect on both parties, and the limitation of the demand.


9. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: While the right to demand transfer or reimbursement (Factor 3) is a critical aspect, without specific details on the query context (Factor 5), the impossibility of performance, or the acquisition of substitute rights or profits, it's not possible to ascertain legal validity. The absence of key factors like the cause or the extent of damage makes this combination insufficient for validation.


10. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario includes the impossibility of performance (Factor 1), the acquisition of a substitute right or profit by the obligor (Factor 2), and the obligee's right to demand transfer or reimbursement (Factor 3). It covers all critical aspects outlined in the article for determining legal validity, making the juridical act legally valid under these conditions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the given problem based on the provided article and query, let's break down the assessment into two tasks as defined.


### Task 1: Assessing Query Factors

Given the query: "If, after the conclusion of the contract for sale, a buyer (B) pays 1000000 yen for X, but before a seller (A) delivers X to B, X is burned-out due to grounds attributable to B, and A obtains 700,000 yen of the insurance money for damage caused by the destruction of X, B may claim payment of 700,000 yen to A."

And the factors:
1. **Impossibility of Performance**: The query mentions that X is burned-out, which could render the performance (delivery of X) impossible.
2. **Acquisition of Substitute Right or Profit**: A obtains insurance money, which can be seen as a substitute profit due to the destruction of X.
3. **Right to Demand Transfer or Reimbursement**: B may claim payment of 700,000 yen from A, indicating a demand for reimbursement.
4. **Extent of Damage**: The query specifies that B may claim 700,000 yen, which is the amount A obtained from insurance, potentially linking it to the extent of damage or loss.
5. **Query Context**: The scenario involves a contract for sale and an event (destruction of X) affecting the obligation.

Assessment:
- (Query entails 1): The destruction of X due to grounds attributable to B could make the performance (delivery of X) impossible.
- (Query entails 2): A acquires insurance money as a substitute profit after X is destroyed.
- (Query entails 3): B demands reimbursement (payment of 700,000 yen) from A.
- (Query entails 4): The claim is for the amount A received from insurance, which could relate to the damage sustained by B or the value of the lost obligation.
- (Query entails 5): The context involves a contract and an event impacting the obligation.


### Task 2: Evaluating Query Validity

Given the query and its entailment of factors related to the article, we assess whether it explicitly determines the juridical acts (or obligations) as legally valid or invalid.

The query suggests that B may claim payment from A under specific conditions (destruction of X and A receiving insurance money). This scenario aligns with the principles outlined in Article 422-2, which allows an obligee to demand transfer or reimbursement if the obligor gains a substitute right or profit due to the same cause that made the performance impossible.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the alignment with Article 422-2:
"(Query Valid)"


The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we must first factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Performance of an Obligation**: The article discusses the performance of an obligation, implying that there are obligations between parties.
2. **Impossibility Due to Non-attributable Grounds**: The impossibility of performing an obligation is due to grounds not attributed to either party, suggesting an external factor beyond the control of both parties.
3. **Right to Refuse Counter-Performance**: The obligee has the right to refuse counter-performance if the performance of the obligation becomes impossible.
4. **Lack of Attribution**: The cause of the impossibility is not attributable to either party, which is a crucial condition for the right to refuse counter-performance.
5. **Contractual or Legal Obligations**: The context implies that there are contractual or legal obligations between parties, and these obligations involve some form of performance and counter-performance.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given the factored components, we can analyze queries to determine their validity in the context of Article 536(1). However, since a specific query is not provided for analysis, I will demonstrate how to approach this with a hypothetical query:

- **Query**: If a natural disaster destroys the goods that one party was supposed to deliver, can the other party refuse to pay?

Based on the factors:
- The performance of delivering goods has become impossible due to the natural disaster.
- This cause is not attributable to either party (assuming neither party was responsible for the disaster).
- The article states that if the performance becomes impossible due to non-attributable grounds, the obligee may refuse counter-performance.

Therefore, this hypothetical query would be considered valid in the context of Article 536(1), as it aligns with the factors outlined. 

**Response to Hypothetical Query**: Y

This approach demonstrates how to factor the article and use these factors to evaluate the validity of a query within the legal context provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors from Article 536(1), I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The performance of an obligation (Factor 1) becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party (Factor 2), which aligns with the conditions under Article 536(1), making the refusal of counter-performance legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: While there's a right to refuse counter-performance (Factor 3) and contractual or legal obligations are involved (Factor 5), without the performance becoming impossible due to non-attributable grounds, the conditions for refusing counter-performance under Article 536(1) are not fully met, rendering the act invalid.

3. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although there's an obligation (Factor 1) and the cause of impossibility is not attributed to either party (Factor 4), without the performance becoming impossible due to these non-attributable grounds, the conditions for applying Article 536(1) are incomplete, making the act invalid.

4. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: The impossibility due to non-attributable grounds (Factor 2) and the presence of contractual or legal obligations (Factor 5) do not alone justify refusing counter-performance without the specific performance of an obligation being impacted, rendering the act invalid under Article 536(1).

5. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The right to refuse counter-performance (Factor 3) combined with the lack of attribution for the cause of impossibility (Factor 4) directly aligns with the conditions under Article 536(1), making the refusal legally valid.

6. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario includes all necessary elements: the performance of an obligation becomes impossible (Factors 1 and 2), and there's a right to refuse counter-performance (Factor 3). This fully meets the conditions under Article 536(1), making the act legally valid.

7. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: The lack of attribution for the cause of impossibility (Factor 4) and the presence of contractual or legal obligations (Factor 5) are insufficient on their own to justify refusing counter-performance under Article 536(1), as they do not address the performance becoming impossible.

8. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The performance becomes impossible due to non-attributable grounds (Factor 2), and there's a right to refuse counter-performance (Factor 3). These factors directly relate to the conditions under Article 536(1), making the refusal legally valid.

9. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although there are obligations (Factor 1) and contractual or legal obligations involved (Factor 5), without the performance becoming impossible due to non-attributable grounds, the scenario does not meet the criteria under Article 536(1), rendering the act invalid.

10. (1, 2, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive scenario includes all key elements: the performance of an obligation (Factor 1), impossibility due to non-attributable grounds (Factor 2), lack of attribution for the cause (Factor 4), and contractual or legal obligations (Factor 5). It fully aligns with Article 536(1), making the refusal of counter-performance legally valid.

### Task 1:
Given the query: "If, after the conclusion of the contract for sale and before A delivers X to B, X is burned down caused by negligence of a third party, the debt to pay the price of B is extinguished by operation of law."

Assessing each factor in relation to the query:

1. **Performance of an Obligation**: The query mentions the delivery of X from A to B, which is an obligation.
   - (Query entails 1)

2. **Impossibility Due to Non-attributable Grounds**: The destruction of X due to a third party's negligence makes performance impossible and is not attributable to either party directly involved in the contract.
   - (Query entails 2)

3. **Right to Refuse Counter-Performance**: The query implies that B no longer has to pay (counter-performance) because the debt is extinguished, which aligns with the right to refuse counter-performance under certain conditions.
   - (Query entails 3)

4. **Lack of Attribution**: The cause (negligence of a third party) is explicitly stated as not being attributable to either A or B.
   - (Query entails 4)

5. **Contractual or Legal Obligations**: The query discusses contractual obligations (delivery and payment) within a legal framework (contract for sale, operation of law).
   - (Query entails 5)

### Task 2:
The query states that "the debt to pay the price of B is extinguished by operation of law," which means it explicitly determines the juridical act (obligation to pay) as being legally invalid due to circumstances beyond the control of the parties involved.
- (Query Invalid)

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement with respect to Article 567, let's break down the key elements involved:

### Begin Factoring
1. **Delivery of Subject Matter**: The seller delivers the subject matter that has been ascertained as part of the sale.
2. **Post-Delivery Loss or Damage**: The loss or damage occurs after delivery due to reasons not attributable to either party.
3. **Buyer's Rights After Delivery**: The buyer cannot demand cure, price reduction, compensation, or contract cancellation due to post-delivery loss or damage under specified conditions.
4. **Tender of Performance**: The seller offers performance by delivering conforming goods, but the buyer refuses or is unable to accept.
5. **Consequences of Refusal or Inability to Accept**: Similar protections apply as in the case of delivery when the buyer refuses or cannot accept the goods and they are subsequently lost or damaged through no fault of either party.
6. **Payment Obligation**: The buyer's obligation to pay the price remains unaffected by post-delivery loss or damage under these conditions.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 6>

Given that we have factored the article into its key components, let's address a hypothetical query to demonstrate how one might assess legal validity:

Query: "If a buyer refuses to accept delivered goods due to reasons not attributable to either party and those goods are subsequently damaged, can the buyer refuse to pay for them?"

Based on the factors identified:
- The seller has tendered performance by delivering conforming goods (Factor 4).
- The buyer's refusal to accept does not negate their obligation to pay if the subsequent loss or damage is due to reasons not attributable to either party (Factors 2, 5, and 6).

Therefore, considering these factors in light of Article 567, the query would be considered legally invalid because it suggests a scenario where the buyer could refuse payment under conditions where the article explicitly states they may not. 

Response: N

Explanation: The response is "N" because the article specifically protects the seller's right to payment even if the goods are lost or damaged after delivery or tender of performance, provided the loss or damage is due to reasons not attributable to either party, and the buyer had refused or was unable to accept the goods.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors from Article 567:


1. (1, 2 | N)
Justification: The seller delivers the subject matter, and it is lost or damaged after delivery due to reasons not attributable to either party. However, since only factors 1 and 2 are present, we do not have information about the buyer's rights or obligations after delivery. Therefore, based on the limited information, the juridical act of refusing payment would be invalid.


2. (3, 6 | Y)
Justification: The buyer cannot demand cure, price reduction, compensation, or contract cancellation due to post-delivery loss or damage, and the buyer's obligation to pay the price remains unaffected. Since both factors 3 and 6 are present, indicating that the buyer has no recourse for post-delivery issues and must still pay, the juridical act of paying the price is legally valid.


3. (4 | N)
Justification: The seller tenders performance by delivering conforming goods, but we do not have information about the buyer's response or what happens to the goods afterward. Without additional factors, we cannot determine the legal validity of any juridical acts related to payment or contract cancellation.


4. (1, 5 | N)
Justification: The seller delivers the subject matter, and similar protections apply when the buyer refuses or cannot accept the goods and they are subsequently lost or damaged through no fault of either party. However, since factor 2 (post-delivery loss or damage) is not present, we do not know if the goods were actually lost or damaged after delivery. Therefore, based on these factors alone, any claims about payment or contract cancellation would be premature and thus invalid.


5. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The loss or damage occurs after delivery due to reasons not attributable to either party, and the buyer cannot demand cure, price reduction, compensation, or contract cancellation due to post-delivery loss or damage. Given these factors, the seller's right to payment is protected, making any refusal to pay by the buyer legally invalid.


6. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The seller tenders performance by delivering conforming goods, and similar protections apply as in the case of delivery when the buyer refuses or cannot accept the goods and they are subsequently lost or damaged through no fault of either party. Since both factors related to tender and subsequent loss or damage are present, the juridical act of demanding payment from the buyer is legally valid.


7. (1, 4 | N)
Justification: The seller delivers the subject matter, and the seller tenders performance by delivering conforming goods. However, without information about what happens to the goods after delivery or tender (factors 2 or 5), we cannot conclude that any juridical acts related to payment are legally valid.


8. (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: The buyer cannot demand cure, price reduction, compensation, or contract cancellation due to post-delivery loss or damage, and the seller tenders performance by delivering conforming goods. Given these conditions, the seller has fulfilled their obligations, making any attempt by the buyer to avoid payment legally invalid.


9. (2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The loss or damage occurs after delivery due to reasons not attributable to either party, and the buyer's obligation to pay the price remains unaffected by post-delivery loss or damage under these conditions. Therefore, the juridical act of demanding payment is legally valid.


10. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | Y)
Justification: All factors are present, indicating a complete scenario where the seller delivers conforming goods, the buyer refuses or cannot accept them, the goods are lost or damaged through no fault of either party after delivery or tender, and the buyer's rights to demand cure or reduction are limited. Given this comprehensive set of conditions, the juridical act of demanding payment from the buyer is legally valid, as all protections and obligations outlined in Article 567 are accounted for.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address both tasks based on the provided query and factors:

1. **Task 1:**
   - Factor 1: Delivery of Subject Matter - The query mentions A tendering the performance of delivery, which implies delivery of subject matter. Hence, (Query entails 1).
   - Factor 2: Post-Delivery Loss or Damage - The query talks about X being lost after being tendered for delivery, aligning with post-delivery loss. Thus, (Query entails 2).
   - Factor 3: Buyer's Rights After Delivery - This factor is about the buyer's inability to demand certain remedies post-delivery under specific conditions. The query implies a refusal to pay, which touches on this but does so in a context (gross negligence by A) that doesn't align perfectly with the factor as described. So, it's nuanced: (Query entails 3) but with significant caveats due to the gross negligence aspect.
   - Factor 4: Tender of Performance - The query explicitly mentions A tendering the performance of delivery, so (Query entails 4).
   - Factor 5: Consequences of Refusal or Inability to Accept - Since B refuses to accept without a legitimate reason and X is subsequently lost, this factor applies. Therefore, (Query entails 5).
   - Factor 6: Payment Obligation - The query discusses B's potential refusal to pay the price despite the circumstances, directly relating to the payment obligation. Hence, (Query entails 6).

2. **Task 2:**
Given that the query involves gross negligence by A while X was in A's custody after being tendered for delivery, this introduces a significant factor not explicitly covered by the protective provisions of Article 567 as outlined. The article seems to protect the seller from claims or refusal of payment when loss or damage is due to reasons not attributable to either party. However, gross negligence on the part of the seller (A) would likely be considered a reason attributable to them, potentially invalidating their protection under Article 567.

Therefore, considering the introduction of gross negligence by A, which alters the scenario's alignment with the protective provisions outlined in Article 567, the query seems to suggest that B might have grounds to refuse payment due to this negligence. This interpretation would imply that the juridical act (obligation to pay) under these specific circumstances could be considered legally invalid.

So, the response is: (Query Invalid).

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to Article 424-7, let's first break down the key components and principles outlined in this article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Definition of Parties Involved**: The article specifies who stands as a defendant in an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act, categorizing them based on their roles such as beneficiaries or subsequent acquirers.
2. **Legal Action Against Beneficiaries and Subsequent Acquirers**: It outlines that the beneficiary or the subsequent acquirer can be defendants in actions concerning demands for rescission of fraudulent acts, depending on who is being targeted by the demand.
3. **Notice Requirement**: The article stipulates that if an obligee files such an action, they must give notice of suit to the obligor without delay.
4. **Context of Fraudulent Acts and Rescission**: The focus is on actions related to rescinding fraudulent acts, implying a context where fraud has been alleged and one party seeks to undo or rectify the situation due to this fraud.
5. **Procedural Requirements for Legal Actions**: It touches on procedural aspects by mentioning the necessity of notice in certain legal filings, highlighting the importance of proper procedure in these actions.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we're asked to evaluate a query without the specific query provided, let's consider how one might assess the validity of a hypothetical query against Article 424-7:

- If the query directly relates to who can be considered a defendant in an action for rescission of a fraudulent act or the procedural steps (like notice requirements) that must be taken during such actions, it would likely be considered valid (**Y**) because these are core aspects covered by the article.
- However, if the query pertains to topics not addressed within Article 424-7, such as the specifics of what constitutes a fraudulent act, the penalties for committing fraud, or other legal principles not mentioned (e.g., statutes of limitations, burden of proof), it might be deemed invalid (**N**) because these aspects are either not covered or only tangentially related to the article's focus.

Without a specific query provided, one must infer based on the structure and content of Article 424-7. The factors outlined provide a framework for understanding the legal context and principles the article addresses, which can then be used to assess the validity of any given query against this backdrop.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 424-7, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of these factors has occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: This case involves an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act against both the beneficiary and the subsequent acquirer. Given that Article 424-7 specifically outlines procedures for such actions, including who stands as a defendant, this scenario is legally valid.

2. (3 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the notice requirement to the obligor is considered. Without an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act being filed, the notice itself does not render the juridical act invalid, but it lacks context for validity under Article 424-7.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves defining parties involved in an action and the context of fraudulent acts and rescission. Since these are core aspects covered by Article 424-7, this combination is legally valid.

4. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: Here, we have legal action against beneficiaries or subsequent acquirers and procedural requirements for legal actions. Both are directly addressed in Article 424-7, making this scenario legally valid.

5. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: This case involves the notice requirement and the context of fraudulent acts but lacks specificity on who is involved or the type of action being taken. Without clear parties or an action defined, it's difficult to ascertain legal validity directly from Article 424-7.

6. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: Defining parties involved and procedural requirements for legal actions are both crucial elements of Article 424-7. Thus, this combination is legally valid as it directly pertains to the article's stipulations.

7. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves legal action against beneficiaries or subsequent acquirers and the notice requirement to the obligor. Since both factors are explicitly covered by Article 424-7, this case is considered legally valid.

8. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The context of fraudulent acts and rescission along with procedural requirements for legal actions are central to understanding and applying Article 424-7. Therefore, this scenario is legally valid.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This case combines defining parties involved, legal action against beneficiaries or subsequent acquirers, and the notice requirement. All these factors are integral parts of Article 424-7, making this scenario legally valid.

10. (1, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: Involving the definition of parties, the context of fraudulent acts, and procedural requirements, this case encompasses key elements of Article 424-7. As such, it is considered legally valid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors to assess legal validity according to Article 424-7, ensuring no two cases use the same combination of factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the given article, we need to analyze and factor the provided legal articles into key components. Given the two articles (Article 424-5 and Article 424), we will break down their essential elements.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Knowledge of Prejudice**: The obligor must know that their act will prejudice the obligee.
2. **Beneficiary's Knowledge**: The beneficiary must not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced for Article 424 to apply.
3. **Subsequent Acquirer's Knowledge**: For a demand of rescission against a subsequent acquirer, they must know (at the time of acquisition) that the obligor's act will prejudice the obligee if acquiring directly from the beneficiary.
4. **Chain of Knowledge for Subsequent Acquirers**: If property is acquired through multiple subsequent acquirers, all must know that the obligor's act will be prejudicial to the obligee for a demand of rescission to be valid against any of them.
5. **Right to Demand Rescission**: The obligee has the right to demand rescission if the conditions outlined in Article 424 and Article 424-5 are met.
6. **Property Transfer**: The property must have been transferred to the beneficiary for these rules to apply.
7. **Court Involvement**: The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act that prejudices them under the specified conditions.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 7>

Given this factoring and without a specific query provided, I will explain how one might approach determining legal validity based on these factors:

- If a query involves scenarios where the obligor's knowledge of prejudice, the beneficiary's lack of knowledge, or subsequent acquirers' knowledge of potential prejudice are in question, it would likely be considered valid (Y) as these are central to the articles.
- Queries about the chain of acquisition and knowledge among multiple subsequent acquirers would also fall under valid considerations (Y), given Article 424-5's detailed conditions for such scenarios.
- A query that ignores the necessity of the obligor knowing their act will prejudice the obligee or incorrectly assumes a beneficiary or subsequent acquirer can be unaware of this prejudice without consequence might be considered invalid (N).
- Any query implying that an obligee cannot demand rescission under the specified conditions or misunderstanding the role of court involvement would also be invalid (N).

Without a specific query to analyze, these factors provide a framework for evaluating legal validity based on Articles 424 and 424-5.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 424 and Article 424-5, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will involve a subset of the factors, and I will determine whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N) based on the articles.

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor knows their act will prejudice the obligee (Factor 1), and the beneficiary does not know at the time of the act that the obligee will be prejudiced (Factor 2). This meets the basic conditions for a demand of rescission under Article 424.

2. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The subsequent acquirer knows at the time of acquisition that the obligor's act will prejudice the obligee (Factor 3), and the obligee has the right to demand rescission (Factor 5). This scenario directly supports a valid demand for rescission against the subsequent acquirer.

3. (4, 6 | N) 
Justification: Even if there is a chain of knowledge among subsequent acquirers (Factor 4) and property has been transferred to the beneficiary (Factor 6), without the obligor's knowledge of prejudice or the beneficiary's lack of knowledge, this scenario does not fully meet the conditions for a valid demand of rescission.

4. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor knows their act will prejudice the obligee (Factor 1), and the subsequent acquirer also knows at the time of acquisition that the obligor's act will be prejudicial (Factor 3). This scenario supports a valid demand for rescission.

5. (2, 7 | N) 
Justification: The beneficiary's lack of knowledge (Factor 2) and court involvement (Factor 7) are not sufficient on their own to establish a valid demand for rescission without the obligor's knowledge of prejudice or other key factors.

6. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A chain of knowledge among subsequent acquirers (Factor 4) combined with the obligee's right to demand rescission (Factor 5) supports a valid scenario for demanding rescission, especially in complex transactions involving multiple parties.

7. (1, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor's knowledge of prejudice (Factor 1) and the transfer of property to the beneficiary (Factor 6) provide a foundational basis for a demand of rescission under Article 424.

8. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: The beneficiary's lack of knowledge (Factor 2) and the subsequent acquirer's knowledge (Factor 3) do not together establish a valid scenario without considering the obligor's intent or other essential factors.

9. (5, 7 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee's right to demand rescission (Factor 5) coupled with court involvement (Factor 7) directly supports the validity of seeking legal recourse under the conditions outlined in Article 424 and Article 424-5.

10. (1, 4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario includes the obligor's knowledge of prejudice (Factor 1), a chain of knowledge among subsequent acquirers (Factor 4), and property transfer to the beneficiary (Factor 6). It comprehensively meets the conditions for a valid demand of rescission under both articles, considering the complexities of subsequent acquisitions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1 - Knowledge of Prejudice
The query mentions that D knows the gifts of X will prejudice the obligee of A, which implies knowledge of prejudice. Thus, (query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2 - Beneficiary's Knowledge
There is no direct mention in the query about the beneficiary's (B) knowledge at the time of receiving X. However, this factor is more relevant to Article 424 directly rather than the scenario described between B and D. Thus, we cannot conclusively say it's directly entailed but let's move on as it's not directly asked.

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3 - Subsequent Acquirer's Knowledge
The query explicitly states that D knows the gifts of X will prejudice the obligee of A, which aligns with this factor. Thus, (query entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4 - Chain of Knowledge for Subsequent Acquirers
Since there is no mention of multiple subsequent acquirers beyond D in the query, we cannot directly apply this factor without assuming additional context not provided.

## Step 5: Assessing Factor 5 - Right to Demand Rescission
The query involves C claiming to D to rescind the sale between B and D, which implies a demand for rescission. Thus, (query entails 5).

## Step 6: Assessing Factor 6 - Property Transfer
The query mentions that B sells and delivers X to D, indicating a property transfer. Thus, (query entails 6).

## Step 7: Assessing Factor 7 - Court Involvement
There's no direct mention of court involvement in the query provided. It discusses a claim between parties but doesn't specify the legal process or venue.

## Step 8: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query involves specific conditions under which a demand for rescission can be made (knowledge of prejudice by the subsequent acquirer, property transfer), and it implies a legal action (demand to rescind), we must assess if these align with the legal principles outlined. The key condition here is whether D's knowledge and the act itself justify C's claim to rescind.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

article: Article 424-5 If the obligee is entitled to make demand rescission for fraudulent act against the beneficiary, and a person subsequently acquires the property which has been transferred to the beneficiary, the obligee may also make demand for rescission of fraudulent act against the subsequent acquirer only in the situations specified in the following items according to the categories set forth in the respective items:
(i) if the subsequent acquirer acquires the property from the beneficiary: the subsequent acquirer, at the time of the acquisition, knows that the obligor's act will be prejudicial to the obligee; or
(ii) if the subsequent acquirer acquires the property from another subsequent acquirer: the relevant subsequent acquirer and all the subsequent acquirers that previously acquired the property, at the time of their respective acquisitions, know that the obligor's act will be prejudicial to the obligee.
Article 424 (1) An obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee; provided, however, that this does not apply if a person that benefits from that act (hereinafter referred to as the "beneficiary" in this Subsection) does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.

 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, let's break down Article 424 into its core components or factors:

### Begin Factoring
1. **Obligee's Right to Demand Rescission**: The obligee has the right to demand that the court rescind an act by the obligor.
2. **Knowledge of Prejudice**: The act must be committed with the knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.
3. **Beneficiary's Knowledge**: If there is a beneficiary of the act, the act's validity in terms of rescission also depends on whether the beneficiary knew (at the time of the act) that the obligee would be prejudiced.
4. **Court Involvement**: The process of rescinding the act involves a court demand by the obligee.
5. **Prejudice to the Obligee**: The core reason for potentially rescinding the act is that it prejudices the obligee.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we can analyze queries against them to determine their legal validity within the context provided by Article 424. However, since a specific query is not provided in your request, I'll demonstrate how this factoring could apply to a hypothetical query:

**Hypothetical Query**: Can an obligee demand rescission of an act if both the obligor and the beneficiary were unaware that it would prejudice the obligee?

Based on the factors:
- The **Obligee's Right to Demand Rescission** is present.
- **Knowledge of Prejudice** by the obligor might not be relevant if neither party knew about the potential prejudice.
- **Beneficiary's Knowledge** directly impacts this scenario, as it specifies that if the beneficiary does not know about the prejudice at the time of the act, the act cannot be rescinded under Article 424.

Given these points, the query seems to touch on the critical aspect of knowledge regarding prejudice. The article explicitly states that if the beneficiary does not know about the potential prejudice, the act cannot be rescinded, which would imply that in such a case, the obligee's demand for rescission might not be valid under Article 424.

Therefore, without a specific query provided, it's challenging to give a definitive "Y" or "N". However, using the hypothetical query as an example, based on the factors and especially considering **Beneficiary's Knowledge**, one could argue that if both the obligor and beneficiary were unaware of the prejudice, the grounds for rescission as outlined in Article 424 might not be met, suggesting a response of "N" for such a scenario.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 424, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee has the right to demand rescission, and the obligor knew about the prejudice. Since both conditions are met, the act can be considered legally invalid.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although there's a beneficiary who didn't know about the prejudice and the act prejudices the obligee, without the obligor's knowledge of the prejudice or the obligee demanding rescission, the grounds for invalidation under Article 424 are incomplete.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee demands rescission through the court, which aligns with the article's requirement for court involvement in the process of rescinding an act. Given that the obligee has this right, the act can be considered legally valid for rescission purposes.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor knew about the prejudice, and the act indeed prejudices the obligee. These conditions directly relate to the core reason for rescission under Article 424, suggesting the act is legally invalid.

5. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Even if there's a beneficiary who didn't know about the potential prejudice and the process involves a court demand, without the knowledge of prejudice by the obligor or the obligee's right to demand rescission being directly relevant, the act remains legally valid.

6. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the obligee has the right to demand rescission and the obligor knew about the prejudice, if the beneficiary did not know that the act would prejudice the obligee, Article 424 specifies this as a condition where the act cannot be rescinded, making it legally valid.

7. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The involvement of the court and the fact that the act prejudices the obligee are crucial. However, without the knowledge of the obligor or the beneficiary's state of mind regarding prejudice, while these factors support a basis for potential rescission, they don't directly invalidate the act without further conditions being met.

8. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: The obligor knew about the prejudice, but if the beneficiary didn't know, according to Article 424, this ignorance on the part of the beneficiary protects the act from being rescinded, making it legally valid under these specific circumstances.

9. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee has the right to demand rescission, and the act prejudices the obligee. These conditions directly align with the purpose of Article 424, suggesting that if other conditions are met (like knowledge of prejudice), the act could be considered legally invalid.

10. (1, 2, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: All factors are present - the obligee's right to demand rescission, the obligor's knowledge of prejudice, court involvement, and the act prejudices the obligee. Given that all conditions for rescission under Article 424 are met (except beneficiary's knowledge, which isn't mentioned in this scenario), the act can be considered legally invalid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors to determine the legal validity or invalidity of an act based on Article 424.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to Article 425, let's first factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Article Subject**: The article discusses the effectiveness of a final and binding judgment.
2. **Judgment Nature**: The judgment is specifically about upholding a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act.
3. **Effectiveness Scope**: The judgment's effect extends to both the obligor and all obligees.
4. **Legal Principle**: The principle that a final and binding judgment has broad implications, including on parties directly involved (obligor) and those who stand to benefit or lose from the agreement (obligees).
5. **Fraudulent Act Rescission**: The focus is on acts deemed fraudulent, implying a legal wrong that can be rectified through rescission.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors and considering a hypothetical query such as "A final judgment upholding the demand for rescission of a contract due to fraud affects both the party who committed the fraud and those who were supposed to receive benefits from the contract," we can analyze its validity:

- **Article Subject**: Matches, as it discusses the outcome of a final judgment.
- **Judgment Nature**: Relevant, as it pertains to the rescission of a fraudulent act.
- **Effectiveness Scope**: Aligns with the article's scope regarding obligors and obligees.
- **Legal Principle**: Consistent, in that a final judgment on fraud would impact all relevant parties.
- **Fraudulent Act Rescission**: Directly related, as the query involves rescinding a contract due to fraud.

Since all factors are addressed and logically align with the context provided by Article 425, without an actual query to assess against these factors, we must consider a generic approach to determining validity based on the information given. If a query were to logically follow from these principles (e.g., regarding the impact of such a judgment on parties involved in a fraudulent contract), it would be considered valid.

Therefore, if the query directly pertains to how a final and binding judgment affecting a fraudulent act impacts all parties involved (obligor and obligees) as outlined in Article 425, without more specific details on the query itself, we must assume a hypothetical scenario where such a query could indeed logically follow from the article's context.

However, given the instruction to provide an answer based on the provided format and considering that no actual query was analyzed against these factors directly within this response:

The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors of Article 425, we will consider combinations of these factors in various contexts. The factors are:

1. **Article Subject**: The article discusses the effectiveness of a final and binding judgment.
2. **Judgment Nature**: The judgment is specifically about upholding a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act.
3. **Effectiveness Scope**: The judgment's effect extends to both the obligor and all obligees.
4. **Legal Principle**: The principle that a final and binding judgment has broad implications, including on parties directly involved (obligor) and those who stand to benefit or lose from the agreement (obligees).
5. **Fraudulent Act Rescission**: The focus is on acts deemed fraudulent, implying a legal wrong that can be rectified through rescission.

Here are 10 case scenarios with their respective justifications:

1. (1, 2 | Y)  
Justification: If the article subject and judgment nature factors occur, indicating a final and binding judgment about a fraudulent act's rescission, it logically follows that such a judgment would be legally valid as it directly addresses the fraud.

2. (3, 5 | Y)  
Justification: When the effectiveness scope and fraudulent act rescission factors are present, suggesting a judgment affects all parties involved in a fraudulent act, the juridical act is legally valid because it aligns with the principle of addressing and rectifying fraud through legal means.

3. (1, 4 | N)  
Justification: If only the article subject and legal principle factors are considered without specifics on judgment nature or effectiveness scope, the scenario lacks sufficient detail to conclusively determine the juridical act's validity regarding a specific fraudulent act or its rescission.

4. (2, 5 | Y)  
Justification: The presence of judgment nature and fraudulent act rescission factors implies a direct focus on rectifying a legal wrong through rescission, which aligns with legal principles aimed at addressing fraud, thus making the juridical act legally valid.

5. (3, 4 | N)  
Justification: With only the effectiveness scope and legal principle factors present, there's an absence of specific context regarding the judgment's subject or nature, making it impossible to determine the validity of a juridical act without knowing if it pertains to a fraudulent act or its rescission.

6. (1, 2, 3 | Y)  
Justification: When the article subject, judgment nature, and effectiveness scope factors are all present, indicating a comprehensive approach to addressing a fraudulent act through a final and binding judgment affecting all parties, the juridical act is clearly legally valid.

7. (4, 5 | N)  
Justification: The legal principle and fraudulent act rescission factors alone do not provide enough context about the specific judgment or its scope, making it difficult to conclusively determine the validity of a juridical act without more information.

8. (1, 3, 5 | Y)  
Justification: If the article subject, effectiveness scope, and fraudulent act rescission factors occur, suggesting a broad and final judgment on a fraudulent act affecting all parties, it follows that such a judgment would be legally valid as it comprehensively addresses the fraud.

9. (2, 4 | N)  
Justification: The presence of judgment nature and legal principle factors without information on the article's subject or effectiveness scope leaves ambiguity regarding whether the juridical act specifically pertains to rescinding a fraudulent act and its implications for all parties involved.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)  
Justification: When all factors are present—article subject, judgment nature, effectiveness scope, legal principle, and fraudulent act rescission—it indicates a complete and thorough approach to addressing fraud through legal means, affecting all relevant parties, which would undoubtedly make the juridical act legally valid.

Each case scenario provides a unique combination of factors to assess the validity of a juridical act based on Article 425, ensuring that no two cases use the same combination of factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to the provided articles, let's break down the information into key factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Article 425-4** discusses the rights of a subsequent acquirer when an act done by the obligor is rescinded due to a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act.
2. The article specifies that the subsequent acquirer may exercise certain rights, limited to the value of the counter-performance or the claim extinguished in acquiring the property.
3. **Article 425-2** mentions that if an act concerning property disposition (excluding obligation extinguishment) is rescinded, the beneficiary can demand the return of the counter-performance or its value reimbursement from the obligor.
4. The query's validity hinges on whether it aligns with these provisions regarding the rescission of acts and the rights of subsequent acquirers or beneficiaries.
5. The subsequent acquirer's rights are conditional upon the type of act being rescinded (as per Article 425-2 or the preceding article) and are limited by the value of their counter-performance or extinguished claim.
6. The articles emphasize the importance of the relationship between the obligor, the beneficiary, and the subsequent acquirer in determining rights after a rescission due to fraudulent act demands.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 6>

Given these factors, without a specific query to evaluate against the article's context, it's challenging to provide a definitive "Y" or "N" response regarding the query's legal validity. However, we can infer that for a query to be legally valid in this context, it must align with the conditions and rights outlined in Articles 425-4 and 425-2, particularly concerning the rescission of acts, the subsequent acquirer's rights, and the limitations imposed by the value of counter-performances or extinguished claims. 

If a query were to assert that a subsequent acquirer can exercise rights beyond these limitations or under different conditions not specified in the articles, it would likely be considered invalid ("N"). Conversely, if a query accurately reflects the provisions and limitations set forth in the articles, it would be considered valid ("Y"). The key to determining validity lies in whether the query respects the conditional nature of the subsequent acquirer's rights as outlined in Article 425-4.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors provided:


(1 | Y)
Justification: If only factor 1 occurs, where Article 425-4 discusses the rights of a subsequent acquirer when an act done by the obligor is rescinded due to a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act, then the juridical act is still legally valid because it aligns with the provisions regarding the rescission of acts and the rights of subsequent acquirers.


(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: If factors 2 and 3 occur, where Article 425-4 specifies that the subsequent acquirer may exercise certain rights limited to the value of the counter-performance or the claim extinguished in acquiring the property, and Article 425-2 mentions that if an act concerning property disposition is rescinded, the beneficiary can demand the return of the counter-performance or its value reimbursement from the obligor, then the juridical act is legally valid because it respects the conditions for exercising these rights.


(4, 5 | N)
Justification: If factors 4 and 5 occur, where the query's validity hinges on whether it aligns with these provisions regarding the rescission of acts and the rights of subsequent acquirers or beneficiaries, and the subsequent acquirer's rights are conditional upon the type of act being rescinded, but there is no alignment with the provisions or the conditions for exercising rights are not met, then the juridical act is invalid.


(6 | Y)
Justification: If only factor 6 occurs, where the articles emphasize the importance of the relationship between the obligor, the beneficiary, and the subsequent acquirer in determining rights after a rescission due to fraudulent act demands, then the juridical act is legally valid because it acknowledges this crucial relationship.


(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: If factors 1 and 4 occur, where Article 425-4 discusses the rights of a subsequent acquirer when an act done by the obligor is rescinded due to a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act, and the query's validity hinges on whether it aligns with these provisions regarding the rescission of acts and the rights of subsequent acquirers or beneficiaries, then the juridical act is legally valid because it adheres to the specified conditions.


(2, 6 | Y)
Justification: If factors 2 and 6 occur, where Article 425-4 specifies that the subsequent acquirer may exercise certain rights limited to the value of the counter-performance or the claim extinguished in acquiring the property, and the articles emphasize the importance of the relationship between the obligor, the beneficiary, and the subsequent acquirer, then the juridical act is legally valid because it respects these limitations and relationships.


(3, 5 | Y)
Justification: If factors 3 and 5 occur, where Article 425-2 mentions that if an act concerning property disposition is rescinded, the beneficiary can demand the return of the counter-performance or its value reimbursement from the obligor, and the subsequent acquirer's rights are conditional upon the type of act being rescinded, then the juridical act is legally valid because it aligns with these provisions regarding the conditions for exercising rights.


(1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: If factors 1, 2, and 3 occur, where Article 425-4 discusses the rights of a subsequent acquirer when an act done by the obligor is rescinded due to a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act, Article 425-4 specifies that the subsequent acquirer may exercise certain rights limited to the value of the counter-performance or the claim extinguished in acquiring the property, and Article 425-2 mentions that if an act concerning property disposition is rescinded, the beneficiary can demand the return of the counter-performance or its value reimbursement from the obligor, then the juridical act is legally valid because it comprehensively respects the conditions for exercising these rights.


(4, 6 | N)
Justification: If factors 4 and 6 occur, but there's a failure to align with the provisions regarding the rescission of acts and the rights of subsequent acquirers or beneficiaries despite acknowledging the importance of the relationship between the obligor, the beneficiary, and the subsequent acquirer, then the juridical act is invalid due to this non-alignment.


(1, 5, 6 | Y)
Justification: If factors 1, 5, and 6 occur, where Article 425-4 discusses the rights of a subsequent acquirer when an act done by the obligor is rescinded due to a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act, the subsequent acquirer's rights are conditional upon the type of act being rescinded, and the articles emphasize the importance of the relationship between the obligor, the beneficiary, and the subsequent acquirer, then the juridical act is legally valid because it respects these conditions and relationships comprehensively.

 ### Task 1 Assessment
Given the factors and the query:

- Factor 1: **Article 425-4** discusses the rights of a subsequent acquirer when an act done by the obligor is rescinded due to a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act.  
(Query entails 1) because the query involves a situation where a judgment upholding a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act has become final and binding, which aligns with Article 425-4's context.

- Factor 2: The article specifies that the subsequent acquirer may exercise certain rights, limited to the value of the counter-performance or the claim extinguished in acquiring the property.  
(Query entails 2) since D demanding the return of the price from B implies exercising a right related to the value of the counter-performance.

- Factor 3: **Article 425-2** mentions that if an act concerning property disposition (excluding obligation extinguishment) is rescinded, the beneficiary can demand the return of the counter-performance or its value reimbursement from the obligor.  
(Query entails 3) as the query involves D demanding the return of the price, which can be seen as a form of counter-performance.

- Factor 4: The query's validity hinges on whether it aligns with these provisions regarding the rescission of acts and the rights of subsequent acquirers or beneficiaries.  
(Query entails 4) because the scenario presented involves the rescission of an act due to fraud and the subsequent acquirer's (D's) rights.

- Factor 5: The subsequent acquirer's rights are conditional upon the type of act being rescinded (as per Article 425-2 or the preceding article) and are limited by the value of their counter-performance or extinguished claim.  
(Query entails 5) since D's demand for the return of the price suggests an understanding of exercising rights based on the type of act rescinded and within the limitations of the counter-performance.

- Factor 6: The articles emphasize the importance of the relationship between the obligor, the beneficiary, and the subsequent acquirer in determining rights after a rescission due to fraudulent act demands.  
(Query entails 6) as the query involves interactions between D (subsequent acquirer), B (obligor in this context), and implicitly A or C (related to the original obligation or fraudulent act).

### Task 2 Assessment
Given the analysis above, the query seems to align with the principles outlined in Articles 425-4 and 425-2 regarding the rescission of acts due to fraud and the subsequent acquirer's rights. The query presents a scenario where D demands the return of the price from B following a judgment upholding a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act, which reflects an understanding of the legal framework provided by the articles.

Therefore, considering the alignment with the legal principles outlined:

(i) if the act prescribed in Article 425-2 is rescinded: the beneficiary's right to demand return of the counter-performance or right to demand reimbursement of its value from the obligor, which should have arisen pursuant to the provisions of that Article if the act were rescinded by the demand for rescission of fraudulent act against the beneficiary; or
(ii) if the act prescribed in the preceding Article is rescinded (excluding the case of rescission pursuant to the provisions of Article 424-4): the beneficiary's claim against the obligor, which should have been restored pursuant to the provisions of the preceding Article if the act were rescinded by demand for rescission of fraudulent act against the beneficiary.

And then conclude with a "Y" or "N" answer indicating whether the query is legally valid within the context of the article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. The factors are based on the articles mentioned:

- Article 438: Novation between one joint and several obligor and the obligee.
- Article 439(1): Set-off invoked by one of the joint and several obligors against the obligee.
- Article 439(2): Refusal to perform obligation due to another's set-off right.
- Article 440: Merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee.
- Article 441: General principle on circumstances affecting one joint and several obligor.

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (Article 438 | Y) - If novation occurs between one joint and several obligor and the obligee, the claim is extinguished for all, making the obligation legally invalid for all parties involved.

2. (Article 439(1) | Y) - When one of the joint and several obligors invokes a set-off against the obligee, the claim is extinguished for the benefit of all joint and several obligors, thus the obligation becomes legally invalid.

3. (Article 440 | Y) - In the event of a merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee, the obligation is deemed performed by that joint and several obligor, making it legally valid to consider the obligation fulfilled for all parties.

4. (Article 438, Article 441 | Y) - Even if novation occurs (Article 438) and considering the general principle (Article 441), the claim's extinction benefits all joint and several obligors, thus the obligation is legally invalid due to novation's precedence.

5. (Article 439(2) | N) - If one of the joint and several obligors has a right to set-off but hasn't invoked it, other obligors may refuse to perform only up to that obligor's share, indicating the obligation remains partially valid until the set-off is invoked or resolved.

6. (Article 439(1), Article 440 | Y) - If a set-off is invoked (Article 439(1)) and then a merger occurs (Article 440), both conditions lead to the obligation being considered fulfilled or extinguished for all joint and several obligors, making it legally invalid.

7. (Article 441 | N) - Under the general principle that circumstances affecting one joint and several obligor do not affect others unless specified otherwise, without any specific event like novation, set-off, or merger, the obligation remains valid for all parties involved.

8. (Article 438, Article 439(2) | Y) - If novation occurs and another joint and several obligor has a right to set-off but hasn't invoked it, the novation's effect (extinguishing the claim for all) takes precedence, making the obligation legally invalid.

9. (Article 440, Article 441 | Y) - In the case of a merger and considering the general principle, since the merger deems the obligation performed by the merging party, this specific circumstance makes the obligation legally invalid for all parties due to its nature of fulfilling the obligation.

10. (Article 439(1), Article 441 | Y) - When a set-off is invoked and considering the general principle, the set-off's effect (extinguishing the claim for all joint and several obligors) applies, thus the obligation becomes legally invalid for all parties involved.

Each case considers unique combinations of factors from the articles provided, yielding determinate verdicts based on the legal context.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given sentence with respect to the provided articles, let's first break down the key points from the articles into factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Novation Effect**: If novation occurs between one joint and several obligor and the obligee, it extinguishes the claim for all joint and several obligors (Article 438).
2. **Set-off Invocation**: A set-off invoked by one of the joint and several obligors against the obligee extinguishes the claim for all joint and several obligors (Article 439, paragraph 1).
3. **Merger Effect**: If there's a merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee, it is deemed that the obligation has been performed by the joint and several obligor involved in the merger (Article 440).
4. **General Rule for Joint and Several Obligors**: Except in specified cases (like novation, set-off, or merger), circumstances affecting one joint and several obligor do not affect others, unless the obligee and another joint and several obligor agree otherwise (Article 441).
5. **Set-off Before Invocation**: Until a set-off is invoked by a joint and several obligor with a claim against the obligee, other joint and several obligors can refuse to perform only up to the share of the obligor invoking the set-off (Article 439, paragraph 2).

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given the query is not explicitly provided, let's consider a hypothetical query for demonstration: "If one joint and several obligor merges with the obligee, does this affect the obligation status of other joint and several obligors?"

To determine if this query is legally valid within the context of the articles:

- **Relevant Factor**: The merger effect as described in Article 440 directly addresses this scenario.
- **Analysis**: According to Article 440, when a merger occurs between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee, it is deemed that the joint and several obligor has performed the obligation. This implies that the obligation status changes for the merging party but does not inherently affect the obligation status of other joint and several obligors unless specified otherwise by agreement (as per Article 441).

Given this context, if we were to answer a query about the effect of merger on other joint and several obligors based solely on the information provided in the articles:

The response would be "Y" because the scenario described directly relates to and is governed by the provisions outlined in the articles, specifically Article 440 regarding the effect of a merger. 

However, without a specific query to evaluate against these factors, this analysis serves as a general framework for approaching questions related to joint and several obligations within the context provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from the articles related to joint and several obligations, we can construct various scenarios to determine the legal validity of different situations. Here are ten unique case scenarios:

1. **Novation Effect Only**: (1 | Y)
   - Justification: If novation occurs between one joint and several obligor and the obligee, according to Article 438, it extinguishes the claim for all joint and several obligors, making the obligation legally valid in this context.

2. **Set-off Invocation Only**: (2 | Y)
   - Justification: When a set-off is invoked by one of the joint and several obligors against the obligee, as per Article 439(1), it extinguishes the claim for all joint and several obligors, thus the obligation is considered legally valid.

3. **Merger Effect Only**: (3 | Y)
   - Justification: A merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee results in the joint and several obligor being deemed to have performed the obligation, as stated in Article 440, making this scenario legally valid.

4. **General Rule for Joint and Several Obligors Only**: (4 | Y)
   - Justification: Under Article 441, except in specified cases, circumstances affecting one joint and several obligor do not affect others unless there's an agreement to the contrary. This principle supports the legal validity of obligations under general conditions.

5. **Set-off Before Invocation Only**: (5 | Y)
   - Justification: Until a set-off is invoked by a joint and several obligor with a claim against the obligee, other joint and several obligors can refuse to perform only up to the share of the obligor invoking the set-off, as per Article 439(2), indicating a specific condition under which obligations remain legally valid.

6. **Novation Effect and Set-off Invocation**: (1, 2 | Y)
   - Justification: Both novation (Article 438) and set-off invocation (Article 439(1)) lead to the extinguishment of the claim for all joint and several obligors. When both occur, their combined effect still results in a legally valid scenario due to the extinguishment of obligations.

7. **Merger Effect and General Rule**: (3, 4 | Y)
   - Justification: A merger (Article 440) deems one joint and several obligor to have performed the obligation, while the general rule (Article 441) states that circumstances affecting one obligor do not affect others unless agreed otherwise. This combination supports legal validity as it covers specific and general conditions.

8. **Set-off Before Invocation and General Rule**: (4, 5 | Y)
   - Justification: The general rule (Article 441) and the condition of set-off before invocation (Article 439(2)) both pertain to the principles guiding joint and several obligations under different circumstances, making this combination legally valid due to its adherence to outlined principles.

9. **Novation Effect, Set-off Invocation, and Merger Effect**: (1, 2, 3 | Y)
   - Justification: This combination involves novation (Article 438), set-off invocation (Article 439(1)), and merger effect (Article 440). All these factors lead to either the extinguishment or fulfillment of obligations in a manner that is legally valid according to the articles.

10. **All Factors**: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)
    - Justification: Considering all factors together—novation effect, set-off invocation, merger effect, general rule for joint and several obligors, and set-off before invocation—it's evident that each factor contributes to a scenario where obligations are either extinguished or deemed fulfilled according to specific legal principles. Thus, this comprehensive combination also yields a legally valid outcome.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the legal validity of the juridical act or obligations in question.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing the Query for Factors
To determine if the query entails any of the factors listed, we need to examine each factor in relation to the given query. The query discusses a scenario where D manifests the intention to release another obligor (C) from the obligation to D, and its impact on D's ability to claim payment from another obligor (A).

## Step 2: Evaluating Factor 1 - Novation Effect
The query does not explicitly mention novation between one joint and several obligor and the obligee, so it does not directly entail factor 1.

## Step 3: Evaluating Factor 2 - Set-off Invocation
There is no mention of a set-off being invoked by any of the joint and several obligors against the obligee in the query, so it does not entail factor 2.

## Step 4: Evaluating Factor 3 - Merger Effect
The query does not discuss a merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee, thus it does not entail factor 3.

## Step 5: Evaluating Factor 4 - General Rule for Joint and Several Obligors
The scenario involves circumstances affecting one joint and several obligor (C being released by D) and its impact on others (D's claim against A), which relates to how obligations are affected among joint and several obligors. This seems to align with the general rule outlined in factor 4, especially considering the mention of intentions and their effects on obligations.

## Step 6: Evaluating Factor 5 - Set-off Before Invocation
The query does not discuss a set-off before invocation by a joint and several obligor with a claim against the obligee, so it does not entail factor 5.

## Step 7: Determining Query Validity
To assess if the query is valid or invalid in terms of legal validity, we need to consider if it explicitly determines the juridical acts (or obligations) as legally valid or invalid. The query implies that D may not claim payment from A under certain conditions, which suggests a specific legal outcome based on the intentions and actions of the parties involved.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 4)}$

 To analyze the query's validity with respect to Article 439, let's break down the key elements of the article and then evaluate how they relate to any potential queries.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Joint and Several Obligors**: The article discusses a scenario involving multiple obligors who are jointly and severally liable.
2. **Claim Against the Obligee**: One of the joint and several obligors has a claim against the obligee.
3. **Set-off Invocation**: The process by which an obligor invokes a set-off, potentially affecting the liability of all joint and several obligors.
4. **Extinction of Claim**: When one joint and several obligor invokes a set-off, it leads to the extinction of the claim for the benefit of all joint and several obligors.
5. **Refusal to Perform**: Other joint and several obligors may refuse to perform their obligation to the extent of the share of the obligor who has a claim against the obligee until that claim is invoked as a set-off.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 5

Given these factors, we can assess the validity of any query regarding Article 439 by determining if it logically follows from or contradicts these established points. However, without a specific query provided in your request, I'll create a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how one might evaluate the validity based on these factors:

**Hypothetical Query**: If one joint and several obligor invokes a set-off against the obligee, can the other obligors still be held liable for their full share of the obligation?

To answer this query:
- **Factor 1 (Joint and Several Obligors)**: Relevant as it establishes the shared liability.
- **Factor 2 (Claim Against the Obligee)** and **Factor 3 (Set-off Invocation)**: Directly relevant because they outline the conditions under which a set-off can be invoked.
- **Factor 4 (Extinction of Claim)**: Indicates that once a set-off is invoked, it benefits all joint and several obligors by potentially reducing their liability.
- **Factor 5 (Refusal to Perform)**: Suggests that before a set-off is invoked, other obligors may limit their performance based on the claiming obligor's share.

Based on these factors, the query seems to logically follow from the context provided by Article 439. The article implies that once a set-off is invoked by one of the joint and several obligors, it could reduce or extinguish the claim for all of them, suggesting that their liabilities are intertwined with the outcome of such an invocation.

Given this analysis and without a specific query to evaluate against the factors derived from Article 439, I must emphasize the importance of directly applying these principles to any given scenario to determine its legal validity accurately. 

However, since no direct query was provided for evaluation, it's essential to note that any conclusion regarding the query's validity would depend on how closely it aligns with or diverges from the factors outlined in Article 439.

For a proper assessment of a query's validity against Article 439, one must examine whether the query respects the principles of joint and several liability, set-off invocation, and the effects thereof as described. Without a specific query to assess, I provide this general framework for analysis. 

If you were to ask about the hypothetical scenario provided:
The answer would be "Y" because it directly relates to how Article 439 addresses the impact of a set-off on joint and several obligors' liabilities.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors derived from Article 439, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a specific subset of factors has occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The presence of joint and several obligors (Factor 1) and one of them having a claim against the obligee (Factor 2) sets the stage for potential set-off invocation. This combination does not inherently invalidate the juridical act; rather, it establishes the conditions under which a set-off could be invoked, making the scenario legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y)
Justification: When an obligor invokes a set-off (Factor 3), and other obligors may refuse to perform their obligation to the extent of the claiming obligor's share (Factor 5), it indicates a mechanism for adjusting liabilities based on individual claims against the obligee. This scenario is legally valid as it reflects the procedural aspects of handling joint and several obligations in the context of set-offs.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The existence of joint and several obligors (Factor 1) coupled with the extinction of a claim for the benefit of all obligors once a set-off is invoked (Factor 4) underscores the principle that the actions of one can affect all in terms of liability. This scenario is legally valid as it aligns with the principles outlined for managing joint liabilities.

4. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: A claim against the obligee (Factor 2) followed by the invocation of a set-off (Factor 3) directly relates to how obligations can be adjusted or extinguished based on counterclaims. This is a core aspect of managing debts and obligations in legal contexts, making this scenario legally valid.

5. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: If a claim is extinguished for the benefit of all joint and several obligors (Factor 4), but other obligors refuse to perform their obligation based on another's share (Factor 5), there might be a conflict in how liabilities are managed post-set-off invocation. This scenario could lead to confusion or inconsistency in applying Article 439, potentially rendering it invalid due to the unclear application of liability adjustments.

6. (1 | Y)
Justification: The mere existence of joint and several obligors (Factor 1) does not inherently invalidate a juridical act. In fact, this is a common legal structure for shared responsibilities, making this scenario legally valid as it establishes a basis for further actions or conditions without contradicting Article 439.

7. (2 | N)
Justification: Having a claim against the obligee (Factor 2) without any action taken (like invocation of a set-off) does not directly impact the validity of the juridical act regarding joint and several obligations. However, considering this factor in isolation might suggest an incomplete application of Article 439 principles, potentially leading to invalidation due to lack of clarity on how the claim affects the obligation.

8. (3 | Y)
Justification: The invocation of a set-off by one obligor (Factor 3) is a clear action that can affect all joint and several obligors' liabilities. This scenario is legally valid because it directly applies the principles outlined in Article 439 regarding how set-offs impact obligations.

9. (5 | N)
Justification: If other joint and several obligors refuse to perform their obligation to the extent of another's share without any prior invocation of a set-off or claim against the obligee, this could be seen as an unjustified refusal based on Article 439. This scenario might be considered invalid because it does not align with the conditions under which such refusals are deemed legally permissible.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: When all factors occur—joint and several obligors exist (Factor 1), one has a claim against the obligee (Factor 2), a set-off is invoked (Factor 3), leading to the extinction of the claim for all (Factor 4), and other obligors adjust their performance based on shares (Factor 5)—this comprehensive scenario aligns closely with the full application of Article 439. It covers all aspects of how joint and several obligations are managed in the context of claims and set-offs, making it legally valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 439, allowing for a nuanced understanding of how different scenarios might play out under this legal framework.

 ### Begin Factoring
1. The article discusses joint and several obligors, where one obligor can perform an obligation or obtain a common discharge using their own property.
2. The performing obligor must know about other joint and several obligors but fails to notify them about the common discharge.
3. Another joint and several obligor has a defense that can be asserted against the obligee due to the first obligor's actions without notice.
4. This defense can also be asserted against the obligor who obtained the discharge, up to the extent of the other obligor's share in the obligation.
5. If the other joint and several obligor uses set-off as a defense against the obligor who obtained the discharge, the latter may request the obligee to fulfill the obligation that should have been extinguished by set-off.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given the query is not explicitly provided in your prompt, I will address the task based on the instruction to evaluate the validity of a hypothetical query against the given legal article. However, since no specific query is presented for validation against Article 443, I'll provide a general approach on how one might assess the validity of a query based on the factors extracted.

To determine if a query logically follows from the context provided by Article 443, one would need to compare the elements of the query (e.g., its claims about joint and several obligations, discharge, notice, defenses, and set-offs) against these factored components. 

For instance, if a query suggests that an obligor who obtains a discharge without notifying other joint and several obligors cannot be subject to a defense by another obligor based on the same obligation, this would contradict factor 3 and thus not logically follow from the article (leading to an answer of "N"). Conversely, if a query aligns with the principles outlined in the factors, such as the right of an obligor to request performance from the obligee after a set-off defense is raised against them by another joint and several obligor (as per factor 5), it would be considered valid ("Y").

Since no specific query was provided for evaluation against Article 443's context, I've outlined a methodological approach based on the factors identified. For any given query to be deemed legally valid within this context, its assertions must align with or logically follow from these factors without introducing contradictions or assumptions not supported by the article itself.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors extracted from Article 443:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: If one joint and several obligor performs the obligation using their own property (factor 1) and knows about other joint and several obligors but fails to notify them (factor 2), this situation still aligns with the basic premise of Article 443 regarding joint and several obligations. The lack of notice doesn't inherently invalidate the act, as the article suggests consequences for such actions rather than declaring them invalid outright.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: If another joint and several obligor has a defense that can be asserted against the obligee due to the first obligor's actions without notice (factor 3), but this factor occurs in isolation without any performance or discharge by an obligor, it does not directly relate to the validity of a juridical act under Article 443. The existence of a defense alone doesn't determine the validity of an obligation.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When one joint and several obligor performs the obligation or obtains a discharge using their own property (factor 1), and another joint and several obligor can assert a defense against the first obligor up to their share of the obligation (factor 4), this scenario directly follows from Article 443's provisions. The act is legally valid as it involves recognized principles of joint and several obligations.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If an obligor knows about other joint and several obligors but fails to notify them about the common discharge (factor 2), and another obligor uses set-off as a defense against the first obligor who may then request the obligee to perform the obligation (factor 5), this scenario is complex but still valid under Article 443. The knowledge and failure to notify, combined with the subsequent actions and defenses, are all scenarios contemplated by the article.

5. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: When one joint and several obligor performs an obligation or obtains a discharge using their own property (factor 1), and another joint and several obligor has a defense against the obligee due to the first obligor's actions without notice (factor 3), this situation is directly addressed by Article 443. The performance or discharge, combined with the existence of a defense, indicates a legally valid scenario as it involves recognized elements of joint and several obligations.

6. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If another joint and several obligor can assert a defense against the first obligor up to their share of the obligation (factor 4), and this leads to a situation where the first obligor requests the obligee to perform an obligation that should have been extinguished by set-off (factor 5), this is a valid scenario under Article 443. Both factors directly relate to the consequences of actions taken by joint and several obligors, which the article governs.

7. (2 | N) 
Justification: Knowing about other joint and several obligors but failing to notify them about the common discharge (factor 2), in isolation, does not determine the validity of a juridical act. This factor alone doesn't provide enough context to assess the legal validity of an obligation or action under Article 443.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: When all initial factors occur—performance or discharge by one obligor using their property (factor 1), knowledge and failure to notify other obligors (factor 2), and the existence of a defense for another obligor against the obligee (factor 3)—this comprehensive scenario is legally valid. It aligns closely with the situations Article 443 addresses, involving performance, notice, and defenses among joint and several obligors.

9. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: If another joint and several obligor has a defense against the obligee due to the first obligor's actions without notice (factor 3), and this leads to a situation where an obligor requests the obligee to perform an obligation that should have been extinguished by set-off (factor 5), this scenario is valid. It involves recognized defenses and consequences under Article 443, indicating a legally coherent and thus valid situation.

10. (1, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: When one joint and several obligor performs the obligation or obtains a discharge using their property (factor 1), another obligor can assert a defense up to their share of the obligation (factor 4), and this leads to a request for the obligee to perform an obligation that should have been extinguished by set-off (factor 5), this scenario is legally valid. It encompasses key elements of joint and several obligations, including performance, defenses, and set-offs, all of which are governed by Article 443.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 1
The query mentions A paying 600000 yen to D and claiming reimbursement from C, which involves one obligor performing an obligation or obtaining a common discharge using their own property. Thus, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 2
The query states that A knows C is a joint and several obligor but does not give notice to C before claiming reimbursement, aligning with the condition of knowing about other joint and several obligors but failing to notify them. Thus, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 3
The query implies that C has a defense against A due to A's actions without notice, which corresponds to another joint and several obligor having a defense against the obligee (in this case, against A who obtained the discharge). Thus, (Query entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 4
The query does not explicitly mention C asserting this defense against A up to the extent of C's share in the obligation. However, it implies a situation where defenses are being asserted, which could align with this factor indirectly. For strict assessment, given the information provided, (Query not entails 4) because it doesn't directly address the extent of the share.

## Step 5: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 5
The query mentions C duly asserting a set-off as defense against A and then states that A may request D to pay 200000 yen which should have been extinguished due to set-off. This directly aligns with factor 5, where if the other joint and several obligor uses set-off as a defense, the obligor who obtained the discharge may request the obligee to fulfill the obligation that should have been extinguished by set-off. Thus, (Query entails 5).

## Step 6: Evaluating Query Validity
Given that the query aligns with the principles outlined in Article 443 and the factors derived from it, particularly in how it describes the interaction between joint and several obligors, defenses, and set-offs, we can conclude on the validity of the juridical acts described. The query does not explicitly question the legality or validity of these acts but rather presents a scenario that fits within the legal framework provided by Article 443. Therefore, (Query Valid).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement based on Article 466-5, let's break down the information provided into key factors and analyze them to determine if the query logically follows from the article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Article Context**: The article discusses the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment, specifically in relation to claims for deposits in a deposit account.
2. **Scope of Restriction**: The restriction on assignment can be asserted against a third party, such as an assignee.
3. **Knowledge Requirement**: The assignee must have known or not known due to gross negligence about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
4. **Claim Specification**: The article specifically mentions "claims for deposits" as the subject of potential restriction.
5. **Legal Implication**: The manifestation of intention can be duly asserted against third parties under specific conditions.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, to determine if a query is legally valid with the context of Article 466-5, we need the actual query to assess its validity. However, since no specific query was provided for evaluation, I'll create a hypothetical scenario based on common legal queries related to assignment restrictions:

**Hypothetical Query**: Can an assignee who was unaware of the restriction on assignment due to gross negligence claim rights over a deposit account?

Based on the factors:
- The article specifies that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment can be asserted against an assignee who knew or did not know due to gross negligence.
- This implies that ignorance due to gross negligence does not exempt the assignee from the restriction.

Therefore, considering the hypothetical query and applying it to the given context:
The answer would be "N" because the article suggests that even if the assignee did not know about the restriction due to gross negligence, the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment can still be asserted against them. This indicates that such ignorance does not inherently invalidate the restriction on assignment.

However, without a specific query provided for evaluation, this response is based on a hypothetical scenario and aims to illustrate how one might approach determining legal validity within the context of Article 466-5.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 466-5, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of the factors has occurred and provides a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid or invalid.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The article context (factor 1) and scope of restriction (factor 2) are sufficient to establish that a manifestation of intention to restrict assignment can be asserted against third parties like assignees, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | N)
Justification: If only the knowledge requirement (factor 3) and legal implication (factor 5) are considered, without knowing about the article context or scope of restriction, it's unclear if the assignee's ignorance due to gross negligence affects the validity. However, since factor 5 implies conditions under which the manifestation can be asserted, and factor 3 specifies a condition (knowledge or gross negligence), their combination suggests that not meeting these conditions could invalidate the act against the assignee, hence invalid.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The article context (factor 1) specifically mentioning claims for deposits and claim specification (factor 4) clarifies that restrictions are indeed applicable to deposit accounts, making the juridical act legally valid in this context.

4. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: The scope of restriction (factor 2) allows assertion against third parties, and legal implication (factor 5) indicates that such assertions can be made under specific conditions, suggesting that when these conditions are met, the juridical act is legally valid.

5. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: If the knowledge requirement (factor 3) and claim specification (factor 4) are present but without considering the article context or scope of restriction, the ignorance due to gross negligence might not be directly relevant to claims for deposits. This lack of clarity on how these factors interact with the legal framework suggests the act could be invalid.

6. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The article context (factor 1) and knowledge requirement (factor 3) together imply that the manifestation of intention can indeed be restricted based on what the assignee knew or should have known, supporting the legal validity of such restrictions.

7. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: The scope of restriction (factor 2) against third parties and claim specification (factor 4) for deposits indicate that the juridical act is intended to apply specifically to deposit accounts and can be asserted against assignees, making it legally valid.

8. (5 | N)
Justification: Considering only the legal implication (factor 5) without any context about the article, scope of restriction, knowledge requirement, or claim specification leaves too many uncertainties about under what conditions the manifestation can be asserted, potentially rendering the juridical act invalid due to lack of clear applicability.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: With the article context (factor 1), scope of restriction (factor 2), and knowledge requirement (factor 3) all present, there is a comprehensive basis for asserting that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment can indeed be validly made against assignees who knew or should have known about the restriction.

10. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: Claim specification (factor 4) and legal implication (factor 5) together suggest that the restrictions are specifically applicable to claims for deposits under certain conditions, implying that when these conditions are met regarding deposit accounts, the juridical act is legally valid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors and a clear verdict on the legal validity of the juridical act based on Article 466-5.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To evaluate the query, we first need to factor the given articles into their key components and then assess whether the query logically follows from these components.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Subrogation Condition**: A person who performs an obligation for the benefit of the obligor can be subrogated to the claim of the obligee (Article 499).
2. **Application of Article 467**: The provisions of Article 467 apply in cases where a person is subrogated to the claim of the obligee, unless a person with a legitimate interest in making performance is the one being subrogated (Article 500).
3. **Subrogation Effect**: Subrogation allows the person who performed the obligation to step into the shoes of the obligee, thereby gaining the right to pursue the claim against the obligor.
4. **Legitimate Interest Exception**: There's an exception to the application of Article 467 when the subrogated person has a legitimate interest in making the performance.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given that we need to determine if a query is legally valid within the context provided by these articles, and without a specific query to evaluate, I will provide a general approach on how one might assess validity:

- **Validity Assessment**: To say "Y" (yes), the query must align with or logically follow from at least one of these factors without contradicting any. For instance, if the query pertains to the conditions under which subrogation can occur or the effects of such subrogation, it could be deemed valid if it directly relates to the conditions outlined in Article 499 or the application rules in Article 500.
- **Invalidity**: Conversely, to say "N" (no), the query would need to either contradict one of these factors or introduce a concept that is not supported by them. For example, if a query suggests that subrogation occurs without the performance of an obligation for the obligor's benefit, it would contradict Article 499.

Without a specific query provided in your prompt, I can only outline this general approach to determining validity based on the factors extracted from the given legal articles.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Articles 499 and 500, I will generate 10 case scenarios as instructed. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The occurrence of Factor 1 (Subrogation Condition) alone is sufficient for a juridical act to be considered legally valid because it directly aligns with the conditions under which subrogation can occur as stated in Article 499.

2. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: When both Factor 2 (Application of Article 467) and Factor 4 (Legitimate Interest Exception) are present, the juridical act remains valid because these factors outline specific conditions under which subrogation can apply, including exceptions for legitimate interests.

3. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The combination of Factor 1 (Subrogation Condition) and Factor 3 (Subrogation Effect) supports the validity of a juridical act since it not only establishes the basis for subrogation but also describes its effect, aligning with the principles outlined in Article 499.

4. (2 | N)
Justification: If only Factor 2 (Application of Article 467) is present without any reference to the conditions under which subrogation occurs or its effects, it may not be sufficient on its own to establish validity because it refers to the application of another article without specifying the underlying subrogation condition.

5. (3 | Y)
Justification: The presence of Factor 3 (Subrogation Effect) alone can support the legal validity of a juridical act because understanding the effect of subrogation is crucial for determining how rights are transferred, even if it's considered in isolation from other factors.

6. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: When both Factor 1 (Subrogation Condition) and Factor 2 (Application of Article 467) are present, the juridical act is valid because these factors together cover both the condition for subrogation and how it applies under Article 467.

7. (4 | N)
Justification: If only Factor 4 (Legitimate Interest Exception) occurs without any context regarding the subrogation itself, it's insufficient to determine legal validity since an exception alone does not establish a basis for subrogation.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The combination of Factors 1 (Subrogation Condition), 2 (Application of Article 467), and 3 (Subrogation Effect) provides a comprehensive basis for determining the legal validity of a juridical act, covering conditions, application, and effects of subrogation.

9. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: When Factor 1 (Subrogation Condition) and Factor 4 (Legitimate Interest Exception) are present, the juridical act can still be considered valid because it outlines a specific condition under which subrogation occurs along with an exception that might apply.

10. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The presence of both Factor 2 (Application of Article 467) and Factor 3 (Subrogation Effect) supports the legal validity of a juridical act because it covers how subrogation applies under specific articles and its effects on the parties involved.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors to determine the legal validity of a juridical act based on Articles 499 and 500.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1 - Subrogation Condition
The query mentions a third-party collateral provider paying a secured claim and then exercising the secured claim through subrogation. This scenario implies that the third-party has performed an obligation (paying the claim) for the benefit of the obligor, which aligns with the condition for subrogation as stated in Article 499.

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2 - Application of Article 467
The query does not explicitly mention the application of Article 467 or its provisions. However, it discusses the exercise of a secured claim through subrogation without mentioning any exceptions related to legitimate interest in making performance as outlined in Article 500.

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3 - Subrogation Effect
The query directly relates to the effect of subrogation, where the third-party collateral provider steps into the shoes of the obligee (the original holder of the secured claim) and exercises the claim. This is a direct application of the subrogation effect as it allows the third-party to pursue the claim against the obligor.

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4 - Legitimate Interest Exception
The query does not explicitly address whether the third-party collateral provider has a legitimate interest in making the performance (paying the secured claim). However, by exercising the secured claim through subrogation, it implies that they have taken on the role of the obligee, which might suggest an interest but does not directly invoke the exception related to legitimate interest as outlined in Article 500.

## Step 5: Determining Query Validity
Given the information and the factors assessed, the query seems to align with the principles of subrogation as outlined in the articles. It implies that through subrogation, a third-party can exercise a secured claim without explicitly requiring perfection, which could be seen as a valid application of the juridical acts (or obligations) under the given legal framework.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1)}$

 To address the query regarding Article 502 and its legal validity with respect to a specific scenario, we must first break down the article into its core components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Performance by Subrogation**: The act of one party (the subrogee) taking the place of another party (the obligee) in terms of claiming rights or debts.
2. **Partial Performance**: This refers to performance with respect to only one part of a claim, not the entirety of it.
3. **Consent of the Obligee**: The requirement that the original creditor (obligee) must agree to the subrogation for it to be valid in this context.
4. **Proportional Exercise of Rights**: After partial performance by subrogation, the subrogee and obligee can exercise their rights together but only in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance.
5. **Collaborative Rights Exercise**: The subrogee and obligee exercising their rights jointly, based on the proportion of the claim that has been satisfied through subrogation.

### End of Factoring

Number of factors: 5

Given this breakdown, to determine if a query logically follows from Article 502, we would need to assess whether the query respects these core elements. However, without a specific query provided to evaluate against the factors derived from Article 502, it's not possible to definitively answer "Y" or "N".

If a query were to respect these elements—such as acknowledging partial performance by subrogation, requiring consent of the obligee, and recognizing proportional joint exercise of rights—it would logically follow from the article (answer: Y). Conversely, if a query ignores or contradicts any of these factors (e.g., suggesting that full performance is required for subrogation, or that the subrogee can act without the obligee's consent), it would not logically follow (answer: N).

Without the specific query to analyze against the factored elements of Article 502, a definitive determination cannot be made.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors of Article 502:


1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Performance by subrogation occurred with respect to one part of a claim, and it was a partial performance. Since these two factors are present and there's no contradiction with the article, the juridical act is legally valid.


2. (3 | N) 
Justification: The consent of the obligee is required for the subrogation to be valid in this context, but if only this factor is present without any performance by subrogation or indication of partial performance, it's insufficient on its own to establish validity.


3. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The proportional exercise of rights and collaborative rights exercise are both based on the principle that after subrogation, parties can act together in proportion to their interests. Without performance by subrogation or consent, however, this scenario seems incomplete but assuming it implies those elements were met, it would be valid.


4. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Performance by subrogation and the consent of the obligee are both crucial for a legally valid subrogation process under Article 502. With these factors present, the act is likely to be considered valid.


5. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Partial performance by itself does not guarantee validity without the subrogation or consent elements being explicitly mentioned. The proportional exercise of rights typically follows a valid subrogation process, which isn't fully established here.


6. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Performance by subrogation and collaborative rights exercise imply that there was an agreement or understanding between the parties for joint action post-subrogation. This scenario suggests a level of cooperation and mutual recognition of interests, indicating validity.


7. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: While consent of the obligee is crucial, and proportional exercise of rights indicates how the parties might proceed after subrogation, without actual performance by subrogation or indication that it was partial, this combination does not securely establish a valid juridical act.


8. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Partial performance and consent of the obligee are important aspects but do not by themselves confirm that a legally valid subrogation occurred since they lack direct reference to the subrogation process itself or the proportional exercise of rights post-subrogation.


9. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: With performance by subrogation, partial performance, and consent of the obligee all present, this scenario strongly suggests a legally valid act under Article 502, as it covers key requirements for subrogation.


10. (4, 5, 1 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes proportional exercise of rights, collaborative rights exercise, and performance by subrogation, which together provide a comprehensive basis for determining the validity of the juridical act, indicating that it is indeed valid under Article 502.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from a given legal article, we must carefully analyze the content of both the article and the query, breaking down the key elements (factors) that are presented in the article. This process involves identifying and understanding each component or rule mentioned within the legal text.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Definition of Subrogation**: The concept where a person (the obligee) is entitled to receive payment or compensation from another party, often involving insurance or security interests.
2. **Legitimate Interest in Performing an Obligation**: The article mentions a "person entitled to subrogation," implying this person has a legitimate reason or right to step into the shoes of another (usually the creditor) to enforce an obligation for their benefit.
3. **Intentional or Negligent Loss of Security**: The article specifies that if the obligee causes the security for the obligation to be lost or diminished intentionally or through negligence, it affects the responsibility of the person entitled to subrogation.
4. **Relief from Responsibility**: If the security is lost or diminished due to the obligee's actions, the person entitled to subrogation may be relieved from their responsibility to the extent they cannot seek reimbursement due to this loss.
5. **Third-Party Collateral Provider and Successors**: The provision extends to third-party collateral providers and those who acquire the secured property from them or their successors.
6. **Exception for Reasonable Grounds**: There's an exception if the obligee had reasonable grounds, based on common sense in transactions, for causing the loss or diminution of security.
7. **Query Context**: Understanding that a query must logically follow these established rules and exceptions to be considered valid.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 7

Given this detailed factorization, we can now assess any query against the backdrop of Article 504, evaluating whether it aligns with or contradicts the outlined principles regarding subrogation, security interests, and the responsibilities of parties involved. 

Without a specific query provided to evaluate against these factors, the approach remains general: To validate a query, one must ensure it respects the definitions, conditions (like intentional or negligent actions), exceptions (such as reasonable grounds for the obligee's actions), and the implications for responsibility and relief outlined in Article 504. If a query disregards or misinterprets any of these critical elements, it would not logically follow from the article, leading to an "N" response. Conversely, queries that align with these principles would be marked as "Y".
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors from Article 504:


1. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The person entitled to subrogation has a legitimate interest in performing an obligation and is stepping into the shoes of another party to enforce it. Given that the obligee caused the security to be lost or diminished intentionally, this aligns with the conditions under which the person entitled to subrogation may be relieved from responsibility.


2. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: Even though the person entitled to subrogation may be relieved from their responsibility due to the loss of security and they are a third-party collateral provider, without evidence of intentional or negligent actions by the obligee (factor 3), it's not clear that relief is warranted.


3. (1, 6 | Y) 
Justification: If there was a legitimate interest in performing an obligation and the obligee had reasonable grounds for their actions regarding the security, this falls under an exception where the provisions of relieving responsibility do not apply, thus making the juridical act valid.


4. (2, 3, 7 | Y) 
Justification: A person with a legitimate interest in performing an obligation is seeking subrogation due to the obligee's intentional or negligent loss of security. Given that this scenario respects the definitions and conditions outlined for subrogation and its implications, it is considered valid.


5. (4, 6 | N) 
Justification: Relief from responsibility due to lost or diminished security does not apply if the obligee had reasonable grounds for their actions. Without factors indicating intentional or negligent behavior by the obligee, this scenario suggests an invalid attempt to claim relief.


6. (1, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of a legitimate interest in performing an obligation, intentional or negligent loss of security by the obligee, and involvement of a third-party collateral provider aligns with conditions under which relief from responsibility for the person entitled to subrogation is applicable.


7. (2, 4, 6 | N) 
Justification: While there's a legitimate interest in performing an obligation and potential relief from responsibility due to lost security, the presence of reasonable grounds by the obligee for their actions negates the applicability of relief provisions, thus making this scenario invalid.


8. (3, 5, 7 | Y) 
Justification: The intentional or negligent loss of security by the obligee, coupled with the involvement of a third-party collateral provider and consideration within the query context, supports the validity of seeking relief from responsibility under subrogation.


9. (1, 4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario involves a legitimate interest in performing an obligation, potential relief from responsibility due to security loss, and reasonable grounds by the obligee for their actions. Given that reasonable grounds negate the automatic application of relief, this still could be valid depending on further context, but given the factors directly mentioned, it leans towards being valid under specific conditions.


10. (2, 3, 5, 6 | N) 
Justification: Although there's a legitimate interest in performing an obligation, intentional or negligent loss of security, and involvement of a third-party collateral provider, the presence of reasonable grounds by the obligee for causing the security to be lost or diminished would generally invalidate claims for relief from responsibility under these conditions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the query and the list of factors, let's assess whether the query entails each factor:

1. **Definition of Subrogation**: The query mentions subrogation in the context of seeking reimbursement due to diminution in security, which implies a form of stepping into another's shoes to enforce an obligation for one's benefit. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

2. **Legitimate Interest in Performing an Obligation**: The query refers to a guarantor who is relieved from responsibility under certain conditions, implying the guarantor has a legitimate interest in performing the obligation. Thus, (Query entails 2).

3. **Intentional or Negligent Loss of Security**: While the query does mention the diminution of security, it specifies this happens when the obligee has reasonable grounds for causing the diminution, not necessarily implying intentional or negligent loss. However, the context of diminution is present, so (Query entails 3).

4. **Relief from Responsibility**: The query directly discusses the relief of the guarantor from responsibility to the extent that reimbursement cannot be sought due to security diminution. Hence, (Query entails 4).

5. **Third-Party Collateral Provider and Successors**: There is no explicit mention of third-party collateral providers or their successors in the query. Therefore, (Query not entails 5).

6. **Exception for Reasonable Grounds**: The query explicitly mentions that if the obligee has reasonable grounds for causing the security to be diminished, then the guarantor may not assert relief from responsibility. This directly aligns with the exception for reasonable grounds. So, (Query entails 6).

7. **Query Context**: Since the query involves the application of Article 504 principles regarding subrogation and security interests, it implies an understanding of these concepts within a legal context. Thus, (Query entails 7).

### Task 2:
The query essentially states that if the obligee has reasonable grounds for diminishing the security, the guarantor cannot claim relief from responsibility due to the diminution in security available upon subrogation. This statement aligns with the exception provided in Article 504(2), which suggests that under certain conditions (reasonable grounds), the usual rules regarding relief from responsibility do not apply. The query does not explicitly invalidate any juridical act or obligation but rather clarifies a specific scenario where the guarantor's claim for relief would not be valid. Therefore, considering the context of validating queries against legal principles, this query seems to express an understanding and application of when certain obligations or claims are legally valid or invalid based on given conditions. Hence, (Query Valid).

 To evaluate the query's validity with respect to Article 404, let's first factor the article into its key components and then assess whether the query logically follows from these factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Interest Accrual**: The concept that interest can accrue on a claim.
2. **Statutory Interest Rate**: The rate of interest as defined by statute at the time when the interest first begins to accrue.
3. **Parties' Intention**: The possibility for parties involved in a claim to manifest a particular intention regarding the interest rate.
4. **Default Interest Rate Application**: The application of the statutory interest rate if no specific intention is manifested by the parties.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given that we need to evaluate whether a query logically follows from these factors, but without a specific query provided, I'll create a hypothetical scenario based on common legal queries related to interest rates and claims.


Hypothetical Query: "If the parties do not specify an interest rate for a claim, the statutory interest rate at the time of the first accrual applies."


This query would logically follow from the factors outlined in Article 404 because it directly addresses the application of the statutory interest rate when the parties have not manifested any particular intention regarding the interest rate on their claim.


Therefore, based on this hypothetical scenario and following the instructions provided:


The response to whether the query is legally valid with the context of the article would be: Y


Explanation: The factors outlined in Article 404 directly support the notion that if parties do not specify an interest rate for a claim, the statutory interest rate at the time of the first accrual applies. This includes the concept of interest accrual (Factor 1), the definition and application of the statutory interest rate (Factor 2), the role of parties' intentions (Factor 3), and the default application of the statutory rate (Factor 4). Since all these factors are aligned with the query's assertion, it logically follows from the legal context provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 404, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of the factors occurred. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: If interest accrual occurs (Factor 1) and the statutory interest rate is defined (Factor 2), then the juridical act is legally valid because it aligns with the basic principles of Article 404 regarding interest accrual and statutory rates.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When parties manifest a particular intention regarding the interest rate (Factor 3) and the default application of the statutory rate is considered (Factor 4), the juridical act is legally valid. This is because Article 404 allows for parties' intentions to override default rates, ensuring flexibility in agreements.

3. (1 | N) 
Justification: If only interest accrual occurs (Factor 1) without any consideration of the statutory interest rate or parties' intentions, the juridical act is invalid. This is because Article 404 requires further specifications (like the statutory rate or parties' agreement) to determine the validity of interest claims.

4. (2 | N) 
Justification: The presence of a statutory interest rate alone (Factor 2) does not ensure the juridical act's validity without considering interest accrual or parties' intentions. Article 404 implies that more than just the rate is necessary for a valid claim.

5. (3 | N) 
Justification: If only the parties' intention regarding the interest rate is present (Factor 3), without any reference to statutory rates or interest accrual, the juridical act is invalid. This is because Article 404 requires a basis in statutory law (like the accrual of interest and defined rates) for such intentions to be legally binding.

6. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The default application of the statutory rate (Factor 4) implies that there was interest accrual and potentially an agreement or lack thereof regarding the rate, making the juridical act valid under Article 404's provisions for default rates.

7. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: When both interest accrual occurs (Factor 1) and parties have a particular intention regarding the interest rate (Factor 3), the juridical act is legally valid. This scenario aligns with Article 404's allowance for parties to agree on rates while still adhering to the principle of interest accrual.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of a defined statutory interest rate (Factor 2) and the default application of this rate (Factor 4) makes the juridical act valid. This scenario directly follows Article 404's guidelines for applying statutory rates when parties do not specify otherwise.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: If all factors of interest accrual (Factor 1), a defined statutory interest rate (Factor 2), and the parties' particular intention regarding the interest rate (Factor 3) are present, the juridical act is legally valid. This comprehensive scenario covers all aspects Article 404 addresses regarding interest rates and claims.

10. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When interest accrual occurs (Factor 1), there's a statutory interest rate defined (Factor 2), and the default application of this rate is considered (Factor 4), the juridical act is valid. This scenario reflects Article 404's framework for handling claims with accrued interest, specified rates, and potentially unspecified party agreements.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 404, ensuring no two cases are the same, and provides a clear verdict on the legal validity of the juridical act based on the occurrence of these factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given problem, let's first break down the provided article into its core components or factors to understand its legal implications better.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Default Location for Delivery**: The article specifies that if no specific location is agreed upon for the performance of an obligation, the delivery of a specific thing must occur at the place where that thing was located when the claim arose.
2. **Default Location for Discharge of Obligations**: For obligations other than delivering a specific thing, the discharge (or fulfillment) must happen at the current domicile of the obligee (the person to whom the obligation is owed).
3. **Importance of Intention**: The article highlights that these rules apply unless a particular intention regarding the place of performance is manifested by the parties involved.
4. **Specific vs. Non-Specific Obligations**: It differentiates between obligations involving the delivery of a specific thing and other types of obligations, implying that the nature of the obligation influences where it should be fulfilled.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given this breakdown, we can analyze queries against these factors to determine their legal validity within the context provided by Article 484. However, without a specific query to evaluate, I'll demonstrate how one might approach determining validity based on an example query:

- **Example Query**: "If no location is specified for returning a borrowed book, it should be returned to the borrower's current home."

To determine if this query is legally valid according to Article 484:
- The query involves delivering a specific thing (the book), which aligns with Factor 1.
- It implies that the delivery location is the current domicile of the obligee (in this case, possibly the lender, not the borrower, based on standard interpretations of obligations and who is owed something), touching upon Factor 2 but potentially misapplying it by suggesting the return to the borrower's home.
- The query does not explicitly mention any particular intention regarding the place of performance being manifested, which is crucial according to Factor 3.
- It distinguishes between specific (delivering a book) and non-specific obligations, aligning with Factor 4.

Given these considerations, if we strictly interpret Article 484 without additional context or assuming standard legal definitions:
- The query might seem plausible at first glance because it involves returning something to a domicile. However, it misinterprets who the obligee is (likely the lender in a borrowing scenario) and where the book was initially located when the claim (to return the book) arose.

Thus, based on the article's factors and standard legal logic, without more specific details about intentions or initial locations, the query as stated might not perfectly align with Article 484's stipulations regarding the place of performance for obligations involving specific things. Therefore, a cautious, skeptical approach would likely classify such a query as not logically following from the given legal context due to potential misunderstandings of key terms like "obligee" and the importance of initial locations.

However, without an explicit query provided in your prompt, this analysis serves as a demonstration of how one might apply Article 484's factors to evaluate the validity of a statement regarding obligations and their fulfillment.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 484, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The default location for delivery is clearly specified as the place where the thing was located when the claim arose, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the discharge of obligations other than delivering a specific thing must happen at the current domicile of the obligee, and the nature of the obligation influences where it should be fulfilled, without knowing the intention regarding the place of performance or the initial location of the thing, the juridical act cannot be determined as legally valid.

3. (3 | Y) 
Justification: If a particular intention is manifested with respect to the place where the performance should take place, then the parties' agreement takes precedence, making the juridical act legally valid.

4. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Combining the default location for delivery with a particular intention regarding the place of performance, as long as the intention does not contradict the default rule, the juridical act remains legally valid.

5. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Even if there's an intention regarding the place of performance and it's about discharging obligations other than delivering a specific thing at the obligee's domicile, without clarity on whether this intention aligns with the default rules or not, the juridical act could be seen as invalid due to potential ambiguity.

6. (4 | N) 
Justification: Knowing only that the nature of the obligation influences where it should be fulfilled is insufficient to determine legal validity without information on the other factors such as intention, initial location, or current domicile.

7. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: When both default locations for delivery and discharge of obligations are considered and no specific intention is manifested, following these default rules would make the juridical act legally valid.

8. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of knowing where a specific thing was initially located and understanding that the nature of the obligation affects its fulfillment place provides enough basis to consider the juridical act as legally valid, assuming no contrary intention is expressed.

9. (2, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Despite having information on the discharge location, a manifested intention regarding performance, and knowledge about how obligations are influenced by their nature, if these factors lead to ambiguity or contradiction with default rules, the juridical act could be considered invalid due to confusion over which rule takes precedence.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If all factors are considered—default locations for delivery and discharge, a particular intention regarding performance, and understanding how obligations' nature influences fulfillment—and these align without contradiction, then the juridical act can be confidently deemed legally valid as it respects both the default rules and any manifested intentions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To evaluate the query's validity with respect to Article 539-2, let's break down the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Existence of a Contract**: The article presupposes that there is an existing contract between two parties.
2. **Agreement for Transfer**: One party makes an agreement with a third party to transfer their contractual status.
3. **Consent from the Other Party**: The other party to the original contract must give consent to the transfer.
4. **Transfer of Contractual Status**: Upon consent, the contractual status is transferred to the third party.
### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we can analyze any query to determine if it logically follows from Article 539-2 by checking which of these factors are present or missing.

However, without a specific query provided in your request, I'll explain how one might approach evaluating the validity of a query based on these factors:

- If a query mentions all these elements (existence of a contract, agreement for transfer, consent from the other party, and the outcome of this process), it would likely be considered valid (Y) because it aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 539-2.
- If a query is missing any critical factor (e.g., it mentions an agreement for transfer but does not reference the necessity of consent from the other party), it might be considered invalid (N) because it does not fully adhere to the requirements stated in the article.

Please provide a specific query related to Article 539-2 for a detailed evaluation based on these factors.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 539-2, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a different combination of factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: All factors are present - there is an existing contract (1), one party makes an agreement for transfer (2), the other party gives consent (3), and the contractual status is transferred (4). This scenario fully aligns with Article 539-2, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Only two factors are present - there is an existing contract (1) and one party makes an agreement for transfer (2). However, without consent from the other party (3) and the actual transfer of contractual status (4), this scenario does not meet the requirements of Article 539-2, making the juridical act invalid.

3. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Two factors are present - there is an existing contract (1) and the other party gives consent (3). However, without an agreement for transfer (2) and the actual transfer of contractual status (4), this scenario lacks essential elements required by Article 539-2, rendering the juridical act invalid.

4. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Two factors are present - one party makes an agreement for transfer (2) and the other party gives consent (3). However, without an existing contract (1) as a basis for the transfer and the actual transfer of contractual status (4), this scenario does not comply with Article 539-2, making the juridical act invalid.

5. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Two factors are present - there is an existing contract (1) and the contractual status is transferred (4). However, without an agreement for transfer (2) and consent from the other party (3), this scenario directly contravenes the prerequisites outlined in Article 539-2, making the juridical act invalid.

6. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Two factors are present - one party makes an agreement for transfer (2) and the contractual status is transferred (4). However, without an existing contract (1) to serve as the foundation for the transfer and consent from the other party (3), this scenario fails to meet the criteria set forth in Article 539-2, rendering the juridical act invalid.

7. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Two factors are present - the other party gives consent (3) and the contractual status is transferred (4). However, without an existing contract (1) and an agreement for transfer (2), this scenario lacks critical components required by Article 539-2, making the juridical act invalid.

8. (1 | N) 
Justification: Only one factor is present - there is an existing contract (1). Without an agreement for transfer (2), consent from the other party (3), and the actual transfer of contractual status (4), this scenario does not fulfill any of the conditions specified in Article 539-2, making the juridical act invalid.

9. (2 | N) 
Justification: Only one factor is present - one party makes an agreement for transfer (2). Without an existing contract (1), consent from the other party (3), and the actual transfer of contractual status (4), this scenario does not adhere to the requirements outlined in Article 539-2, rendering the juridical act invalid.

10. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Three factors are present - there is an existing contract (1), one party makes an agreement for transfer (2), and the other party gives consent (3). Although the actual transfer of contractual status (4) is not mentioned, the presence of the first three factors suggests a clear intent to comply with Article 539-2. Given that all prerequisites for the transfer are met, it can be inferred that the transfer would proceed as intended, making the juridical act legally valid under the assumption that the transfer (factor 4) naturally follows from the consent and agreement.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given query, let's first factor the provided legal article into its core components to understand its implications and then assess whether the query logically follows from these factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Contractual Performance**: The article discusses a situation where one party in a contract promises to render a certain performance to a third party.
2. **Third-Party Rights**: It establishes that the third party has the right to claim this performance directly from the obligor (the party promising the performance).
3. **Existence of Third Party at Contract Formation**: The article specifies that the validity of such a contract is not affected by the existence or specification of the third party at the time of its formation.
4. **Direct Claim**: It implies that the third party can make a direct claim for the promised performance, suggesting a legal right to enforce this aspect of the contract.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given the query is not explicitly provided, I will create a hypothetical query based on common questions related to such legal articles: "Can a third party claim performance directly from the obligor if they were not specified at the time of contract formation?"

Reasoning:
- The article clearly states that the validity of the contract and the right of the third party to claim performance are not impaired by the non-existence or non-specification of the third party at the time of contract formation (Factor 3).
- It directly grants the third party the right to claim performance from the obligor (Factor 2), which logically extends to situations where the third party's existence or identity becomes clear after the contract's formation.

Therefore, given this hypothetical query and based on the factors extracted from Article 537, the answer would be "Y" because the article explicitly supports the notion that a third party can claim performance directly from the obligor regardless of their status at the time of contract formation.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 537, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of contractual performance (Factor 1) and third-party rights (Factor 2) is sufficient to establish a legally valid obligation, as the article grants the third party the right to claim performance directly from the obligor.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Even if the existence or specification of the third party at contract formation (Factor 3) and the direct claim by the third party (Factor 4) are considered, the article's provision that the validity of the contract is not impaired supports the conclusion that the obligation is legally valid.

3. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of contractual performance (Factor 1) alone does not negate the possibility of a legally valid obligation, as it is a fundamental aspect of the contract discussed in Article 537.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of third-party rights (Factor 2) and the flexibility regarding the existence or specification of the third party at contract formation (Factor 3) supports the validity of the obligation, as it aligns with the article's intent to protect third-party interests.

5. (4 | N) 
Justification: If only the direct claim by the third party (Factor 4) is considered without any context of contractual performance or third-party rights being established, it may not be sufficient on its own to determine legal validity due to lack of information about the underlying contract terms and parties' obligations.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of contractual performance (Factor 1) and the provision regarding the existence or specification of the third party at contract formation (Factor 3) supports the conclusion that the obligation can be legally valid, as it covers essential aspects of contract formation and third-party involvement.

7. (2 | Y) 
Justification: Third-party rights (Factor 2) being present indicate that the article intends to confer a direct right of action on the third party, suggesting that the juridical act or obligation related to these rights can be legally valid.

8. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of contractual performance (Factor 1) and the direct claim by the third party (Factor 4) implies a structured agreement where obligations are clearly defined for the benefit of the third party, supporting the legality of such an arrangement.

9. (3 | Y) 
Justification: The provision regarding the existence or specification of the third party at contract formation (Factor 3) being present suggests that the contract's validity is not contingent upon these specifics at the time of formation, which supports the conclusion that obligations under such contracts can be legally valid.

10. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of both third-party rights (Factor 2) and the direct claim by the third party (Factor 4) strongly indicates a legally valid obligation, as these factors directly relate to the enforcement and protection of the third party's interests as outlined in Article 537.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor Inclusion for Task 1
Given the query "If the contract of sale stipulates that F, who was not born at the time of the conclusion of the contract, is to acquire the ownership of X, the contract of sale is invalid," we need to assess if this query entails any of the factors listed. The factors are:
1. **Contractual Performance**: The article discusses a situation where one party in a contract promises to render a certain performance to a third party.
2. **Third-Party Rights**: It establishes that the third party has the right to claim this performance directly from the obligor (the party promising the performance).
3. **Existence of Third Party at Contract Formation**: The article specifies that the validity of such a contract is not affected by the existence or specification of the third party at the time of its formation.
4. **Direct Claim**: It implies that the third party can make a direct claim for the promised performance, suggesting a legal right to enforce this aspect of the contract.

The query specifically mentions a situation where a contract's stipulation involves a third party (F) who was not born at the time of contract conclusion, directly relating to Factor 3 (**Existence of Third Party at Contract Formation**).

## Step 2: Determining Query Validity for Task 2
To determine if the query is valid or invalid according to the given legal context, we look at what the query states about the validity of juridical acts (or obligations). The query claims that "the contract of sale is invalid" under specific conditions. This directly addresses the validity of a juridical act (the contract of sale), stating it is invalid.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 3)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context provided by the given legal articles, let's first factor the article into its key components and then reason through how these factors interact with the query to either validate or invalidate it.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Third-party rights accrual**: The right of a third party to claim performance directly from an obligor if one of the parties in a contract promises to render a certain performance to that third party.
2. **Modification or extinguishment prohibition**: After a third party's rights have accrued, the parties to the original contract cannot modify or extinguish those rights without affecting the third party's claim.
3. **Contract cancellation restriction**: If an obligor fails to perform their obligation to a third party after the third party's rights have accrued, the other party to the contract may not cancel the contract without the consent of the third party.
4. **Direct performance claim**: A third party has the right to claim direct performance from the obligor based on the original contract between two parties.
5. **Consent requirement for contract modification or cancellation affecting third-party rights**: Any action (modification, extinguishment, or cancellation) that could affect a third party's accrued rights under a contract requires the consent of the third party.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors and without a specific query to evaluate against them, we can establish a framework for how to approach any query related to Articles 537 and 538:

- **Validation Approach**: A query would be considered valid (Y) if it logically aligns with one or more of the factored components. For instance, stating that a third party has direct recourse against an obligor for non-performance after their rights have accrued would be valid because it directly relates to factors 1 and 4.
  
- **Invalidation Approach**: Conversely, a query would be invalid (N) if it contradicts any of the established factors. For example, suggesting that parties can unilaterally modify or cancel a contract affecting third-party rights without their consent would contradict factors 2, 3, and 5.

To provide a precise answer to a specific query, one must analyze how the query interacts with these factored components, looking for alignment or contradiction. Without a specific query provided in your prompt, we can only outline this approach based on the given legal context.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors of Articles 537 and 538:


1. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, a third party's rights have accrued because one of the parties promised to render performance to them (factor 1), and they can claim direct performance from the obligor (factor 4). Since these factors align with the articles' provisions for third-party rights, the juridical act is legally valid.


2. (2 | N)
Justification: This case involves an attempt to modify or extinguish a third party's accrued rights without their consent (factor 2), which directly contradicts Article 538(1). Therefore, such action would be invalid.


3. (3, 5 | Y)
Justification: Here, the obligor failed to perform, and there's an attempt to cancel the contract without the third party's consent (factor 3), but it also acknowledges the requirement for the third party's consent in such actions (factor 5). Given that factor 5 addresses the need for consent which would make the action valid if followed, this scenario highlights a critical consideration for validity.


4. (1 | Y)
Justification: The sole occurrence of factor 1 indicates that a third party has the right to claim performance directly from an obligor based on a contract between two parties. Since this aligns with Article 537(1), it's legally valid.


5. (2, 3 | N)
Justification: This scenario involves both the modification or extinguishment of third-party rights without their consent (factor 2) and an attempt to cancel the contract under similar conditions (factor 3). Both actions are prohibited by Articles 537 and 538 without the third party's consent, making this juridical act invalid.


6. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this case, a third party can claim direct performance from the obligor (factor 4), and there's an acknowledgment of the need for their consent in any contract modification or cancellation affecting them (factor 5). This scenario respects the rights and procedures outlined in Articles 537 and 538, making it legally valid.


7. (1, 2 | N)
Justification: Although a third party's rights have accrued (factor 1), there's an attempt to modify or extinguish these rights (factor 2) without their consent, which contradicts Article 538(1). Thus, this action is invalid.


8. (3 | N)
Justification: This scenario involves the failure of the obligor to perform and an attempt to cancel the contract without the third party's consent (factor 3), directly violating Article 538(2). Therefore, it's legally invalid.


9. (5 | Y)
Justification: The presence of factor 5 alone indicates that any modification, extinguishment, or cancellation affecting a third party's rights requires their consent. Since this aligns with the protective measures for third-party rights in Articles 537 and 538, acknowledging this requirement makes the act legally valid.


10. (1, 3 | N)
Justification: Although a third party has the right to claim performance (factor 1), the obligor's failure to perform followed by an attempt to cancel the contract without the third party's consent (factor 3) violates Article 538(2). This makes the overall juridical act invalid due to the violation of procedural rights.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1
The query mentions a contract of sale where a third party (G) is to acquire ownership of X, and G manifests an intention to avail of the benefit. This scenario involves a third-party rights accrual, which aligns with factor 1.

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2
The query does not explicitly discuss modification or extinguishment of G's rights by the parties (A and B) after G's rights have accrued. Therefore, it doesn't directly relate to factor 2.

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3
The query states that B may not cancel the contract of sale without G's consent, which aligns with the restriction on contract cancellation after a third party's rights have accrued, as described in factor 3.

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4
While the query involves a direct benefit to a third party (G), it does not explicitly mention G claiming direct performance from the obligor (A). Thus, it doesn't directly entail factor 4.

## Step 5: Assessing Factor 5
The query implies that B needs G's consent to cancel the contract, which aligns with the requirement for consent from the third party before modifying or cancelling a contract that affects their rights, as outlined in factor 5.

## Step 6: Determining Query Validity
Given the alignment of the query with factors 1, 3, and 5, it is clear that the query expresses a legally valid scenario regarding the rights of third parties in contracts and the restrictions on contract cancellation affecting those rights. Therefore, the query is valid.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1), (Query entails 3), (Query entails 5), (Query Valid)}$

1. **Obligation Performance**: The requirement for an obligor to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation.
2. **Impossibility of Performance**: Situations where the performance of an obligation is impossible.
3. **Compensation for Loss or Damage**: The right of an obligee to claim compensation due to failure of performance.
4. **Attribution of Failure**: Grounds not attributable to the obligor that might exempt them from liability for non-performance.
5. **Sale of Rights**: The scenario where the subject matter of a sale is another person's right.
6. **Seller's Obligation to Acquire and Transfer Rights**: The duty of the seller to obtain and transfer rights that belong to someone else in a sales transaction.
7. **Exemption from Liability**: Conditions under which an obligor or a seller might not be held liable for failure to perform, such as impossibility due to reasons beyond their control.

<Number of factors : 7>

To assess the validity of a query against these articles, we would need the specific query in question. However, based on the provided instructions and examples, let's consider a hypothetical query to demonstrate how one might approach determining its legal validity:

Query: "If a seller sells a right that belongs to another person without acquiring it first, can they be held liable for failure to transfer this right?"

Given the factors outlined:
- The **seller's obligation to acquire and transfer rights** (Factor 6) is directly relevant.
- **Attribution of failure** (Factor 4) might also play a role if the seller argues that the failure was due to grounds not attributable to them.
- **Compensation for loss or damage** (Factor 3) could be applicable if the buyer suffers loss due to the seller's failure.

Without a specific query provided in your prompt, it's challenging to give a definitive "Y" or "N" answer regarding its legal validity. However, by analyzing the factors present in the articles and comparing them against the components of any given query, one can logically deduce whether the query aligns with the legal context outlined in Articles 415 and 561.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors outlined from Articles 415 and 561, here are ten unique case scenarios with their respective justifications for determining legal validity:

1. **(1, 3 | Y)**: In this scenario, the obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation (Factor 1), leading to a situation where the obligee claims compensation for loss or damage (Factor 3). Given that the failure is directly attributable to the obligor's actions, the juridical act is considered legally valid, as the obligee has a right to claim compensation.

2. **(4, 6 | N)**: This case involves grounds not attributable to the obligor (Factor 4) and the seller's obligation to acquire and transfer rights (Factor 6). If the failure to acquire and transfer the right is due to reasons beyond the seller's control (e.g., the original owner refuses to sell), then the seller cannot be held liable, making the juridical act invalid in terms of demanding performance from the seller.

3. **(2, 5 | Y)**: The scenario where the performance of an obligation is impossible (Factor 2) and the subject matter of a sale is another person's right (Factor 5) presents an interesting case. If the impossibility is due to the nature of the right being sold (e.g., it no longer exists), then the seller's obligation to acquire and transfer such a right becomes void, but this does not necessarily invalidate the juridical act, as it may still be legally valid in its initial formation.

4. **(1, 6 | Y)**: When an obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation (Factor 1) and is also under an obligation to acquire and transfer a right (Factor 6), the failure directly impacts the seller's ability to fulfill their part of the contract. In such cases, the juridical act can be considered legally valid, as the buyer has grounds for claiming non-performance.

5. **(3, 7 | N)**: This case combines compensation for loss or damage (Factor 3) with conditions under which an obligor or seller might not be held liable (Factor 7). If the failure to perform and subsequent loss are due to reasons exempting the obligor from liability (e.g., force majeure), then the claim for compensation may not stand, making the juridical act invalid in the context of seeking damages.

6. **(4, 2 | N)**: When grounds not attributable to the obligor (Factor 4) and impossibility of performance (Factor 2) are both present, it typically means that the failure or inability to perform is not the obligor's responsibility. Thus, the juridical act would be considered invalid in terms of holding the obligor accountable.

7. **(5, 1 | Y)**: The sale of another person's right (Factor 5) and the requirement for an obligor to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation (Factor 1) create a scenario where the seller must ensure they can deliver what is promised. If the seller fails in this regard due to their own actions, the juridical act remains legally valid as it pertains to the seller's obligations.

8. **(6, 7 | N)**: This case involves the seller's obligation to acquire and transfer rights (Factor 6) and conditions for exemption from liability (Factor 7). If the seller cannot acquire the right due to circumstances beyond their control (and thus is exempt from liability), then demanding they fulfill this obligation would be unjust, rendering the juridical act invalid in this context.

9. **(2, 3 | Y)**: The impossibility of performance (Factor 2) and compensation for loss or damage (Factor 3) suggest a situation where despite the obligor's best efforts, performance is not possible, leading to claims for damages. This scenario does not inherently invalidate the juridical act, as the focus shifts from performance to compensation.

10. **(1, 4 | N)**: When an obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation (Factor 1) but this failure is due to grounds not attributable to them (Factor 4), it indicates that the obligor is not at fault. In such cases, holding the obligor liable would be unfair, making the juridical act invalid in terms of seeking redress from the obligor for the non-performance.

Given these factors, we can analyze queries against them to determine legal validity within the context provided. However, without a specific query to evaluate, we cannot conclude whether a query is legally valid (Y) or not (N). 

For a proper assessment, please provide the query you'd like evaluated against these articles and factors.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors derived from Article 415 and Article 561, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor failed to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation, and the obligee is claiming compensation for loss or damage arising from the failure. Since the obligor's failure is a direct breach of their duty, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The obligor's failure to perform is due to grounds not attributable to them, and they are exempt from compensation. Furthermore, the parties' contractual responsibilities imply that unforeseen circumstances may excuse performance. In this case, the juridical act is invalid.

3. (4 | Y) 
Justification: A seller has an obligation to acquire and transfer a right that belongs to another person when it is the subject matter of a sale. If the seller fails to do so, they are in breach of their contractual duties. Therefore, the juridical act is legally valid.

4. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the obligor failed to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation, the failure is due to grounds not attributable to them. As a result, the obligor is exempt from compensation, rendering the juridical act invalid.

5. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee is claiming compensation for loss or damage arising from the seller's failure to acquire and transfer a right that belongs to another person. Since the seller has an obligation to perform, and their failure has caused harm to the buyer, the juridical act is legally valid.

6. (5 | Y) 
Justification: The parties' contractual responsibilities imply that they must fulfill their obligations as agreed upon or implied by common sense in transactions. If one party fails to do so, they may be held liable for breach of contract. Therefore, the juridical act is legally valid.

7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor failed to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation, which involves acquiring and transferring a right that belongs to another person. Since the obligor's failure is a direct breach of their duty, the juridical act is legally valid.

8. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the obligee is claiming compensation for loss or damage arising from the obligor's failure, the failure is due to grounds not attributable to the obligor. As a result, the obligor is exempt from compensation, rendering the juridical act invalid.

9. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor failed to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation, and the parties' contractual responsibilities imply that they must fulfill their obligations as agreed upon or implied by common sense in transactions. Since the obligor's failure is a direct breach of their duty, the juridical act is legally valid.

10. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: The seller's failure to acquire and transfer a right that belongs to another person is due to grounds not attributable to them, and they are exempt from compensation. In this case, the juridical act is invalid, as the seller's exemption from liability takes precedence over their obligation to perform.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Against Factors
To determine whether the query entails each factor, we'll analyze it against the provided factors one by one.

- **Obligation Performance (Factor 1)**: The query discusses a situation where the seller cannot acquire and transfer rights, implying a failure in performance. Therefore, (Query entails 1).
- **Compensation for Failure (Factor 2)**: The query mentions the buyer claiming compensation for loss or damage, directly relating to this factor. Hence, (Query entails 2).
- **Exemption from Compensation (Factor 3)**: The query specifies a scenario where the case is not caused by grounds attributable to the seller, which relates to exemption conditions. Thus, (Query entails 3).
- **Sale of Rights (Factor 4)**: The query involves the sale of rights, as it discusses the transfer of rights from the seller to the buyer. So, (Query entails 4).
- **Contractual Responsibilities (Factor 5)**: The scenario implies responsibilities based on contractual agreements or implied obligations, such as the seller's duty to acquire and transfer rights. Therefore, (Query entails 5).

## Step 2: Evaluating Query Validity
Given Article 415 and the query's context, if the failure to perform (in this case, the seller's inability to acquire and transfer rights) is due to grounds not attributable to the seller, the buyer generally may not claim compensation according to the exemption stated in Article 415. However, the query suggests that even in such a scenario, the buyer may claim compensation. This interpretation seems to contradict the exemption clause in Article 415, which states that the obligor is not liable for compensation if the failure is due to grounds not attributable to them.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

 ### Begin Factoring
To analyze the given legal article and determine whether a query logically follows from its context, we need to break down the key elements presented:

1. **Non-conformity of performance**: The subject matter delivered does not match the contract terms regarding kind, quality, or quantity.
2. **Buyer's right to demand cure**: The buyer can demand the seller to repair, deliver a substitute, or replenish to cure the non-conformity.
3. **Seller's flexibility in curing non-conformity**: The seller can choose a different method of cure that does not impose an undue burden on the buyer.
4. **Specifying a reasonable period for cure**: The buyer must give the seller a reasonable time frame to cure the non-conformity before taking further action.
5. **Consequences of failure to cure within the specified period**: If the seller fails to cure within this period, the buyer may request a price reduction proportional to the degree of non-conformity.
6. **Exceptions for immediate price reduction request**: The buyer can immediately request a price reduction without specifying a cure period under certain conditions (impossibility to cure, seller's refusal to cure, time-sensitive contracts, or obvious inability to cure).
7. **Buyer's good faith requirement**: For the buyer to request a price reduction immediately in exceptional cases, they must be acting in good faith.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 7>

Given that there is no specific query provided to validate against these factors, I will outline how one might approach determining legal validity based on this factoring:

- **To determine if a query is legally valid**, one would compare the query's conditions and requests against these factors. For instance, if a query involves a buyer requesting a price reduction due to non-conformity without allowing a reasonable time for cure, it would not be valid unless it falls under one of the exceptions outlined (e.g., impossibility to cure).
- **Validation requires matching the query's elements** with the relevant factors. If a query aligns with the conditions and processes described in the article (such as giving the seller adequate time to cure before seeking a price reduction), then it would be considered legally valid ("Y"). Conversely, if a query ignores or contradicts these established procedures (e.g., demanding an immediate price reduction without justification under the exceptions), it would not be valid ("N").

Without a specific query to analyze against these factors, one must consider the structure and conditions provided in the article to assess any potential query's validity.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors from the article:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The buyer received a product that did not match the contract terms regarding kind, quality, or quantity (factor 1), and they demanded that the seller cure the non-conformity by repairing it (factor 2). Since the buyer followed the proper procedure, their demand is legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The seller chose a different method to cure the non-conformity without imposing an undue burden on the buyer (factor 3), but the buyer requested a price reduction without giving the seller a reasonable time frame to cure the issue (factor 5). Since the buyer did not follow the proper procedure, their request is invalid.

3. (4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The buyer specified a reasonable period for the seller to cure the non-conformity (factor 4), and they requested a price reduction immediately due to the seller's refusal to cure, which falls under one of the exceptions (factor 6). Given that the buyer acted within an exception, their request is legally valid.

4. (1, 7 | N) 
Justification: The product delivered did not conform to the contract terms regarding kind, quality, or quantity (factor 1), but the buyer was not acting in good faith when requesting a price reduction (factor 7). Since the buyer's intentions were not genuine, their request is invalid.

5. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The buyer demanded that the seller cure the non-conformity by delivering a substitute (factor 2), and they specified a reasonable period for the seller to do so (factor 4). Since the buyer followed the proper procedure, their demand is legally valid.

6. (3, 7 | N) 
Justification: The seller chose a method to cure the non-conformity that did not impose an undue burden on the buyer (factor 3), but the buyer was not acting in good faith when requesting a price reduction (factor 7). Given the lack of good faith, the request is invalid.

7. (5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The seller failed to cure the non-conformity within the specified period (factor 5), and the buyer requested a price reduction immediately due to the impossibility of curing the issue, which falls under one of the exceptions (factor 6). Since the condition for an exception is met, the request is legally valid.

8. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The product delivered did not match the contract terms regarding kind, quality, or quantity (factor 1), and the seller chose a different method to cure the non-conformity without imposing an undue burden on the buyer (factor 3). Since the seller acted within their rights to choose a cure method, their action is legally valid.

9. (4, 7 | Y) 
Justification: The buyer specified a reasonable period for the seller to cure the non-conformity (factor 4), and they were acting in good faith when requesting a price reduction (factor 7). Given that the buyer followed proper procedures and acted with good intentions, their request is legally valid.

10. (2, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The buyer demanded that the seller cure the non-conformity by repairing the product (factor 2), and they requested a price reduction immediately due to the time-sensitive nature of the contract, which falls under one of the exceptions (factor 6). Since the buyer's request aligns with an exception, it is legally valid.

 To determine whether a given query is legally valid within the context provided by Articles 564 and 565, we first need to factor these articles into their key components. This will help in understanding the legal principles they establish regarding the rights of buyers in cases where the seller's transfer of rights does not conform to the contractual terms.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Article Context**: The provisions are about the buyer's rights when the seller fails to transfer rights as agreed upon.
2. **Exclusion of Preclusion**: Article 564 states that previous articles do not preclude the buyer from claiming compensation or canceling the contract under specific conditions.
3. **Application of Provisions**: Article 565 extends the application of these provisions to cases where the transferred right does not match the contractual terms, including partial failure to transfer rights belonging to another person.
4. **Buyer's Rights**: The articles collectively affirm the buyer's ability to seek compensation or cancellation when the seller's performance is deficient.
5. **Contractual Non-Compliance**: The focus on the seller's failure to comply with contract terms regarding the transfer of rights.
6. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**: The principle that the provisions apply with necessary modifications to similar cases not explicitly mentioned.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 6>

Given these factors, we can assess a query for its legal validity within this context by checking if it aligns with or logically follows from these established principles. However, without a specific query provided to evaluate against the factored context, we cannot directly respond with a "Y" or "N" validation.

If a query were to ask about the buyer's ability to claim compensation when the seller partially fails to transfer rights as per the contract, it would likely be considered valid ("Y") because it directly relates to factors 2, 4, and 5. Conversely, if a query were about the seller's right to compensation for improvements made on a property not belonging to them, without connection to contractual non-compliance or the buyer's rights as outlined, it might be considered invalid ("N") due to lacking direct relevance to the factors outlined, especially factors 1, 3, and 5.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Articles 564 and 565, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will consider a different combination of factors to determine whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The buyer's rights are directly impacted by the seller's failure to transfer rights as agreed upon (factor 1), and despite previous articles, the buyer can still claim compensation or cancel the contract (factor 2), making the act legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y)
Justification: When the transferred right does not match the contractual terms (factor 3) and there's a focus on the seller's failure to comply with these terms (factor 5), the buyer has grounds for seeking compensation or cancellation, thus the act is legally valid.

3. (4, 6 | Y)
Justification: The articles affirm the buyer's ability to seek compensation or cancellation when the seller's performance is deficient (factor 4). Since the provisions apply with necessary modifications to similar cases (factor 6), this principle supports the legal validity of such actions under varied circumstances.

4. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The context of the buyer's rights when the seller fails to transfer rights as agreed (factor 1) combined with the application of provisions to non-conforming transferred rights (factor 3) indicates that the juridical act can be legally valid as it falls within the scope of protecting buyer's interests.

5. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: The exclusion of preclusion allowing buyers to claim compensation or cancel contracts (factor 2) alongside the affirmation of buyers' rights in cases of deficient seller performance (factor 4) supports the legal validity of such claims.

6. (5, 6 | N)
Justification: While contractual non-compliance (factor 5) is a significant issue, and provisions can apply with modifications (factor 6), without direct reference to the buyer's rights or the exclusion of preclusion, the scenario lacks critical elements to automatically deem the act legally valid, thus it could be seen as invalid in the absence of more specific details aligning with other factors.

7. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The article context focusing on buyers' rights when sellers fail to transfer rights as agreed (factor 1) and the affirmation of buyers' rights to seek compensation or cancellation (factor 4) together provide a strong basis for considering such actions legally valid.

8. (2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The principle that previous articles do not preclude buyers from claiming compensation or canceling contracts (factor 2) combined with the mutatis mutandis application of provisions (factor 6) indicates flexibility and support for buyers' rights under various conditions, making such claims legally valid.

9. (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: When the transferred right does not conform to contractual terms (factor 3), and there's an affirmation of the buyer's ability to seek compensation or cancellation due to deficient performance (factor 4), it logically follows that the buyer has a legitimate claim, thus the act is legally valid.

10. (5 | N)
Justification: Considering only the factor of contractual non-compliance (factor 5) without reference to buyers' rights, exclusion of preclusion, or application of provisions, there's insufficient basis to determine the legal validity of the juridical act directly from this single factor alone, suggesting it could be invalid due to lack of direct relevance to protective measures for buyers outlined in other factors.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict based on the principles established by Articles 564 and 565.

 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "In the case that the seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights to the buyer, if the buyer, at the moment of the contract, knows that the rights the buyer has bought do not belong to the seller, the seller may not cancel the contract."

Let's evaluate each factor:

1. **Article Context**: The query discusses a scenario involving the seller's inability to transfer rights and the buyer's knowledge at the time of the contract, which relates to the articles' context about buyers' rights when sellers fail to transfer rights as agreed.
   - (Query entails 1)

2. **Exclusion of Preclusion**: The query does not directly address whether previous articles preclude the buyer from claiming compensation or canceling the contract.
   - (Query not entails 2)

3. **Application of Provisions**: The scenario involves a situation where the transferred right does not match the contractual terms, which could relate to the application of provisions with necessary modifications.
   - (Query entails 3)

4. **Buyer's Rights**: While the query mentions the seller's inability to cancel the contract, it indirectly touches on the buyer's rights by implying the buyer's knowledge affects the contract's validity or the seller's actions.
   - (Query entails 4)

5. **Contractual Non-Compliance**: The query directly involves a case of contractual non-compliance, as the seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights.
   - (Query entails 5)

6. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**: The principle of applying provisions with necessary modifications to similar cases is not explicitly addressed in the query.
   - (Query not entails 6)

### Task 2:
Given the query, it implies that if the buyer knows at the moment of the contract that the rights do not belong to the seller, and yet the seller may not cancel the contract, this suggests a specific condition under which the juridical act (the contract or obligation) could be considered valid or invalid based on the parties' knowledge and actions. However, the query seems to suggest a limitation on the seller's ability to cancel the contract under certain conditions, which might imply that the contract remains valid under those circumstances.

- (Query Valid)

This conclusion is based on the interpretation that the query suggests specific conditions under which the contract or obligations are to be considered legally binding or not, leaning towards validity given the context provided.

The given article can be factored into the following components:
1. **Subject Matter Non-Conformity**: The subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract regarding kind or quality.
2. **Notification Requirement**: The buyer must notify the seller of the non-conformity within one year from the time the buyer becomes aware of it.
3. **Consequences of Late Notification**: If the buyer fails to notify the seller within the specified timeframe, the buyer may not demand cure of the non-conformity, a reduction of the price, claim compensation for loss or damage, or cancel the contract due to the non-conformity.
4. **Exception for Seller's Knowledge or Gross Negligence**: The limitation on the buyer's actions does not apply if the seller knew or should have known about the non-conformity at the time of delivery due to gross negligence.

Given query is missing, so let's assume a query to evaluate: "If a buyer notifies the seller of non-conformity 2 years after becoming aware of it, can they demand a price reduction?"

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

To determine if the query is legally valid within the context of the article:

- The query involves **Subject Matter Non-Conformity** and the buyer's right to **demand a reduction of the price**, which aligns with factors 1 and 3.
- It also touches on the **Notification Requirement** (factor 2), as it specifies that the notification was made 2 years after the buyer became aware of the non-conformity, which is beyond the one-year limit set by the article.
- The query does not explicitly mention the seller's knowledge or negligence at the time of delivery (**Exception for Seller's Knowledge or Gross Negligence**, factor 4), but this aspect could potentially be relevant depending on additional context.

Given these factors and assuming no information about the seller's knowledge or gross negligence, the query would logically follow the legal context if we consider only the factors directly mentioned. However, since the notification was made after the one-year deadline, according to the article, the buyer may not demand a reduction of the price due to the non-conformity unless it falls under the exception related to the seller's knowledge or gross negligence.

Therefore, without additional context suggesting the seller's knowledge or gross negligence, the query as presented would not validate the buyer's ability to demand a price reduction after the deadline. 

However, since I must provide an answer based on whether the query "logically follows the legal context" and considering that the article does indeed discuss scenarios where a buyer can or cannot demand actions due to non-conformity (including the impact of timing on these demands), and given the query directly pertains to these concepts:

The final answer is: Y
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the article, I will generate 10 case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: The subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract regarding kind or quality (factor 1), and the buyer notifies the seller of the non-conformity within one year from the time the buyer becomes aware of it (factor 2). However, since factor 3 is not present, we cannot conclude that the buyer's actions are invalid solely based on factors 1 and 2. But considering only these two factors without any consequence or exception, the juridical act is likely invalid because no specific remedy or action is taken.

2. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: The subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract regarding kind or quality (factor 1), and if the buyer fails to notify the seller within the specified timeframe, they may not demand cure of the non-conformity, a reduction of the price, claim compensation for loss or damage, or cancel the contract due to the non-conformity (factor 3). Without factor 2 (notification requirement) being met, and lacking an exception, the buyer's actions are considered invalid.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract regarding kind or quality (factor 1), and the limitation on the buyer's actions does not apply if the seller knew or should have known about the non-conformity at the time of delivery due to gross negligence (factor 4). Given this exception, even without proper notification timing, the juridical act can still be considered valid because the seller's knowledge or gross negligence overrides other limitations.

4. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: The buyer must notify the seller of the non-conformity within one year from the time the buyer becomes aware of it (factor 2), and failing to do so results in the buyer not being able to demand certain remedies (factor 3). Without the presence of factor 1 (subject matter non-conformity) or factor 4 (seller's knowledge or gross negligence), and considering only the notification requirement and its consequences, the juridical act leans towards being invalid due to missed deadlines.

5. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The buyer notifies the seller within one year (factor 2), and there's an exception for the seller's knowledge or gross negligence (factor 4). Even though factor 1 (subject matter non-conformity) is not explicitly mentioned, if we consider timely notification alongside the seller's potential culpability, the act could be seen as valid because it fulfills one critical requirement and potentially invokes an exception.

6. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The buyer may not demand certain remedies due to late notification (factor 3), but there's an exception if the seller knew or was grossly negligent about the non-conformity (factor 4). Since factor 4 provides a significant exception that can override the consequences outlined in factor 3, and despite the absence of factors 1 and 2, the presence of this exception can still make the juridical act valid under specific circumstances.

7. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: All factors related to non-conformity (factor 1), notification requirement (factor 2), and consequences of late notification (factor 3) are present. However, without the exception provided by factor 4, if the buyer fails to meet the notification deadline as required by factor 2, their actions would be considered invalid according to the article.

8. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The subject matter does not conform to the contract (factor 1), the buyer notifies the seller within one year (factor 2), and there's an exception for the seller's knowledge or gross negligence (factor 4). Given that all these conditions are met, including the critical exception provided by factor 4, the juridical act is valid.

9. (2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The buyer must notify the seller within one year (factor 2), failing to do so limits their actions (factor 3), but there's an exception for the seller's knowledge or gross negligence (factor 4). Even if the notification timing is missed (factor 3), the presence of factor 4 can override these limitations, making the act valid under the condition that the seller was indeed knowledgeable or grossly negligent.

10. (1, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The subject matter does not conform to the contract (factor 1), the buyer faces consequences for late notification (factor 3), but there's an exception if the seller knew or was grossly negligent about the non-conformity (factor 4). This combination suggests that despite potential issues with notification timing, the seller's culpability as outlined in factor 4 can render the juridical act valid.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query, we first need to factor the given article into its key components or factors and then analyze these factors in relation to the query provided. The article discusses the transfer of the status of lessor in a lease agreement upon the assignment of immovables (real estate properties) and the conditions under which this transfer occurs.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Perfection of Lease**: A lease must be perfected according to the laws and regulations, including specific articles mentioned.
2. **Assignment of Immovables**: The relevant immovables are assigned from one party (assignor) to another (assignee).
3. **Transfer of Lessor Status**: Generally, upon assignment, the status of lessor is transferred to the assignee.
4. **Reservation of Lessor Status**: There's an exception where the assignor and assignee can agree that the assignor reserves the status of lessor, and the assignee leases the immovables back to the assignor.
5. **Termination of Lease Between Assignor and Assignee**: If the lease between them or their successors terminates, the reserved lessor status is transferred to the assignee or successor.
6. **Registration Requirement for Asserting Lessor Status**: The transfer of ownership must be registered for the new lessor status to be asserted against the lessee.
7. **Succession of Obligations**: The assignee or successor succeeds to obligations such as reimbursing expenses and refunding security deposits upon acquiring the lessor status.

### End of Factoring

Given these factors, we can analyze a query to determine if it logically follows from the article's context. However, since no specific query is provided for analysis in relation to Article 605-2, I'll demonstrate how one might approach this task with a hypothetical query:

**Hypothetical Query**: If an assignor and assignee agree that the assignor retains lessor status, does the assignee automatically become the lessor upon termination of their lease?

To answer this query based on the factored components:
- The article specifies that if such an agreement is made (Factor 4), the lessor status is not immediately transferred.
- However, it also states that upon termination of the lease between the assignor and assignee or their successors, the reserved lessor status is indeed transferred to the assignee or successor (Factor 5).

Therefore, considering these factors, the hypothetical query would be answered as "Y" because it logically follows from the article's context that the assignee becomes the lessor under the specified conditions.

**Number of factors : 7**

Without a specific query provided in your request, this response demonstrates how to factor the given legal article and apply those factors to assess the validity of a hypothetical query. For actual queries, the same method would be used: factoring the relevant articles into key components and analyzing these factors against the query's assertions or questions.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 605-2, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The lease is perfected according to laws and regulations (Factor 1), and the status of lessor is transferred to the assignee upon assignment of immovables (Factor 3). Since both conditions necessary for a valid transfer of lessor status are met, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The assignor and assignee agree that the assignor reserves the status of lessor (Factor 2), but this alone does not ensure the validity of the lessor status transfer without considering other factors like registration or termination conditions. Given only these factors, it's insufficient to determine a valid transfer, thus making the juridical act invalid.

3. (5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Upon termination of the lease between the assignor and assignee or their successors, the reserved lessor status is transferred (Factor 5), and the transfer of ownership for the immovables under lease is registered (Factor 6). These conditions ensure that the new lessor can assert their status against the lessee legally, making the juridical act valid.

4. (1, 2, 7 | Y) 
Justification: The lease is perfected (Factor 1), there's an agreement for the assignor to reserve lessor status (Factor 2), and upon acquiring lessor status, the assignee succeeds to obligations such as reimbursing expenses and refunding security deposits (Factor 7). Given these comprehensive conditions covering perfection, agreement, and succession of obligations, the juridical act is valid.

5. (3, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The status of lessor is transferred to the assignee upon assignment (Factor 3), and the transfer of ownership for the immovables under lease is registered (Factor 6). Registration is crucial for asserting the new lessor status against the lessee, making this combination sufficient for a valid juridical act.

6. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The assignor reserves lessor status with an agreement that the assignee leases back the immovables (Factor 4), and upon termination of their lease, the reserved lessor status is transferred to the assignee (Factor 5). This sequence ensures a clear transfer of lessor status under specific conditions, making the juridical act valid.

7. (1, 6 | N) 
Justification: While the lease is perfected according to laws and regulations (Factor 1), and there's registration of the transfer of ownership (Factor 6), without factors directly addressing the transfer or reservation of lessor status, it's insufficient to conclude a valid juridical act regarding the transfer of lessor obligations.

8. (2, 7 | N) 
Justification: The agreement for the assignor to reserve lessor status and lease back from the assignee (Factor 2) does not directly ensure the validity of the transfer without considering registration or termination conditions. Succession to obligations (Factor 7) implies a transfer has occurred but doesn't validate the process without more context, making this combination insufficient for a valid juridical act.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: The general rule is that lessor status transfers upon assignment (Factor 3), but an agreement can reserve this status with the assignee leasing back (Factor 4). This combination suggests conflicting intentions regarding the transfer of lessor status and thus does not clearly validate the juridical act without further conditions being met.

10. (5, 7 | Y) 
Justification: Upon termination of the lease between the assignor and assignee or their successors, the reserved lessor status is transferred (Factor 5), and the new lessor succeeds to obligations such as reimbursing expenses and refunding security deposits (Factor 7). This combination addresses both the condition for transfer and the succession of obligations, making the juridical act valid.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding Article 606 and its legal validity with a given context, let's first break down the article into its core components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Lessor's Obligation**: The lessor is obligated to effect repairs necessary for using and making profit from the leased thing.
2. **Exception to Lessor's Obligation**: The lessor's obligation does not apply if repairs are necessary due to grounds attributable to the lessee.
3. **Lessee's Responsibility**: Implicitly, the lessee is responsible for any damages or needs for repair that arise from their actions or negligence.
4. **Scope of Repairs**: The article implies that the scope of repairs includes anything necessary for the use and profitability of the leased thing, unless it falls under the exception.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 4

Given the query is not explicitly stated in your request, I will assume a hypothetical query to demonstrate how one might evaluate its legal validity against Article 606. For instance, if the query were: "Is the lessor responsible for repairs caused by the lessee's negligence?" 

Based on the factoring:
- **Lessor's Obligation** (Factor 1) suggests the lessor has a general duty to maintain the leased property.
- **Exception to Lessor's Obligation** (Factor 2) directly addresses that the lessor is not responsible for repairs needed due to the lessee's actions, which would include negligence.

Therefore, considering these factors, the query would be answered as "N" because it does not logically follow from Article 606 that the lessor is responsible for repairs caused by the lessee's negligence; the article explicitly states the opposite.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 606, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The lessor's obligation to effect repairs necessary for using and making profit of the leased thing is a fundamental aspect of the lease agreement, making this scenario legally valid.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: If repairs are necessary due to grounds attributable to the lessee, the lessor is not responsible, rendering the juridical act invalid in this context.

3. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The lessor's obligation to maintain the property and the implicit responsibility of the lessee for damages or needs for repair align with the principles of the article, making this scenario legally valid.

4. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Even though the scope of repairs is necessary for use and profitability, if the need arises from the lessee's actions, the lessor is not responsible, rendering this scenario invalid.

5. (3 | N) 
Justification: The lessee's responsibility alone does not establish a valid juridical act without considering the lessor's obligations or exceptions, making this scenario invalid.

6. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Although the lessor has an obligation to effect repairs, the presence of an exception due to the lessee's actions negates this obligation, rendering the scenario invalid.

7. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The scope of repairs being necessary for use and profitability is a fundamental aspect of the lease agreement, making this scenario legally valid as it aligns with the lessor's obligations under normal circumstances.

8. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of the lessor's obligation to effect repairs and the scope of these repairs being necessary for use and profitability directly aligns with the article's intent, making this scenario legally valid.

9. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: The lessee's responsibility for damages does not override the exception that negates the lessor's obligation for repairs caused by the lessee, rendering this scenario invalid.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Despite covering all aspects of the article, the presence of an exception (factor 2) due to the lessee's actions takes precedence, negating the lessor's obligation and thus making the scenario legally invalid under these combined circumstances.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 606, allowing for a clear determination of legal validity based on the occurrence of these factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 1
The query states that a lessor assumes an obligation to effect repairs necessary for using and making profit of the leased thing even if repairs are necessary due to any grounds attributable to the lessee. This directly aligns with Factor 1, which mentions the lessor's obligation to effect repairs necessary for using and making profit from the leased thing.

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 2
The query contradicts Factor 2 by suggesting the lessor is responsible even when repairs are due to grounds attributable to the lessee. Factor 2 explicitly states that the lessor's obligation does not apply if repairs are necessary due to grounds attributable to the lessee.

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 3
The query implies that the lessee's responsibility is overridden by the lessor's obligation, which indirectly relates to Factor 3. However, since it doesn't directly address the lessee's responsibility in a manner that aligns with or contradicts this factor without ambiguity, we must consider how it affects the overall interpretation of obligations.

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 4
The query does not explicitly mention the scope of repairs but implies an expansion of the lessor's obligation to include scenarios typically excluded (e.g., damages due to the lessee). This could be seen as indirectly related to Factor 4, as it discusses what is necessary for use and profitability.

## Step 5: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query directly contradicts Article 606 by suggesting the lessor is responsible for repairs even when they are due to the lessee's actions, it misrepresents the legal obligation as stated in the article. Therefore, the query does not accurately reflect the juridical acts or obligations as legally valid according to Article 606.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1), (Query not entails 2), (Query Invalid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement given Article 611, let's first break down the article into its core factors and then assess whether the query logically follows from these factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Article Context**: The article discusses the adjustment of rent in a lease agreement.
2. **Condition for Reduction**: The reduction in rent is contingent upon it becoming impossible to use or profit from part of the leased property.
3. **Cause of Condition**: This impossibility must be due to reasons not attributable to the lessee (e.g., loss).
4. **Proportionality of Reduction**: The rent reduction is proportional to the value of the part that can no longer be used or profited from.
5. **Assumption of Lease Continuation**: The article implies the lease continues despite the issue with part of the property.

Given these factors, we need a query to assess its legal validity against Article 611. However, since a specific query is not provided in your prompt, let's create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes: "If a lessee can no longer use a portion of the leased property due to a natural disaster (not caused by the lessee), should the rent be reduced?"

### End of Factoring

To answer this question:
- The article clearly states that if part of the leased thing can no longer be used or profited from due to reasons not attributable to the lessee, the rent is to be reduced.
- The cause (natural disaster) fits within "grounds such as loss" and is explicitly stated as not being attributable to the lessee.
- The reduction is to be in proportion to the value of the part that can no longer be used or profited from.

Given these considerations and based on the factors extracted from Article 611, the hypothetical query about reducing rent due to a natural disaster (or any reason not attributable to the lessee) would logically follow the legal context provided. Thus, without a specific query but using this example for demonstration:

The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 611, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each combining different factors to determine the legal validity of the juridical act.

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The article context (factor 1) and condition for reduction (factor 2) both apply when a leased property's usability is partially compromised, making the rent reduction legally valid due to the direct applicability of Article 611's core provisions.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If the cause of the condition (factor 3) is not attributable to the lessee and the proportionality of reduction (factor 4) is considered, then the rent adjustment aligns with the article's intent for fairness, thus being legally valid.

3. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: While the article context (factor 1) and assumption of lease continuation (factor 5) are relevant, without factors related to the condition for reduction or its cause, there's insufficient basis to automatically reduce rent, making it legally invalid in this isolated scenario.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The condition for reduction (factor 2) and the cause of the condition not being attributable to the lessee (factor 3) directly align with Article 611's criteria for reducing rent, thus making such an action legally valid.

5. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although the proportionality of reduction (factor 4) and assumption of lease continuation (factor 5) are considered, without explicit mention of the condition leading to the reduction or its cause, it's not possible to conclusively determine legal validity based solely on these factors.

6. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Combining the article context (factor 1), condition for reduction (factor 2), and cause of the condition (factor 3) provides a comprehensive basis that fits Article 611's criteria for reducing rent due to reasons not attributable to the lessee, thus being legally valid.

7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of a condition for reduction (factor 2) and consideration for proportionality of reduction (factor 4) directly pertains to how Article 611 guides rent adjustments, making such an adjustment legally valid when the criteria are met.

8. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: Knowing the cause of the condition is not attributable to the lessee (factor 3) and assuming the lease continues (factor 5) does not automatically validate a rent reduction without considering the specific conditions or proportionality outlined in Article 611, thus it's legally invalid based on insufficient information.

9. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Given the article context (factor 1) and consideration for the proportionality of reduction (factor 4), if other implicit factors align with Article 611's intent (such as an implied condition for reduction not directly caused by the lessee), then a rent adjustment could be seen as legally valid, focusing on fairness and proportion.

10. (2, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes the condition for reduction (factor 2), the cause of the condition not being attributable to the lessee (factor 3), and the assumption of lease continuation (factor 5). Since these factors collectively align with Article 611's stipulations for adjusting rent, such an adjustment would be legally valid.

Each case has been carefully constructed to ensure a unique combination of factors and a determinate verdict based on the principles outlined in Article 611.

 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context provided by Article 613(3), let's first factor the given article into its key components.

### Begin Factoring
1. **The lessee has the right to sublease a leased thing lawfully.**
2. **The lessor may not assert against the sublessee the cancellation of the lease with the lessee if the sublease is lawful.**
3. **There's an exception where the lessor can cancel due to non-performance by the lessee at the time of cancellation.**
4. **The cancellation in question is by agreement between the lessor and the lessee.**

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we must analyze any query to see if it aligns with or contradicts them, considering each element's implications on the legal relationship between the lessor, lessee, and sublessee.

However, without a specific query provided to evaluate against Article 613(3), I will create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes: "If a lessee lawfully subleases a property, can the lessor cancel the lease with the lessee due to the lessee's non-payment of rent?"

To assess this query:
- Factor 1 supports the legality of subleasing.
- Factor 2 generally protects the sublessee from cancellations not due to their actions.
- Factor 3 introduces an exception for lessor cancellation rights based on lessee non-performance, which aligns with the scenario of non-payment of rent.
- Factor 4 specifies that the cancellation is by agreement, but this does not directly address the scenario of cancellation due to non-payment.

Given these considerations and focusing on the exception in Factor 3, if the lessor has a right to cancel due to non-performance (such as non-payment of rent) at the time of cancellation, it suggests the query could logically follow the legal context provided by Article 613(3), because it deals with a scenario where the lessor's right to cancel is based on the lessee's failure to perform their obligations.

Therefore, for this hypothetical query, the answer would be "Y" (Yes), as it aligns with the conditions under which the lessor can assert cancellation rights against the sublessee due to the lessee's non-performance. 

Please provide a specific query related to Article 613(3) for a precise evaluation.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors of Article 613(3), we'll systematically combine these factors in different ways to assess their impact on the legal validity of the juridical act. Remember, the factors are:

1. The lessee has the right to sublease a leased thing lawfully.
2. The lessor may not assert against the sublessee the cancellation of the lease with the lessee if the sublease is lawful.
3. There's an exception where the lessor can cancel due to non-performance by the lessee at the time of cancellation.
4. The cancellation in question is by agreement between the lessor and the lessee.

Here are 10 case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors:

1. (1, 2 | Y) - In this scenario, the lessee lawfully subleases the property, and the lessor cannot assert cancellation against the sublessee. This is legally valid because it aligns with the protections afforded to the sublessee under normal circumstances.

2. (3, 4 | Y) - Here, the lessor cancels the lease due to non-performance by the lessee, and this cancellation is by agreement. This scenario is legally valid as it falls under the exception allowing for cancellation due to lessee non-performance.

3. (1, 3 | Y) - The lessee has lawfully subleased, but there's an issue of non-performance that could lead to cancellation. This is legally valid because the lawful subleasing and potential for cancellation due to non-performance are both recognized scenarios under the article.

4. (2, 4 | N) - In this case, the lessor may not assert cancellation against the sublessee, but the cancellation is by agreement with the lessee. However, without a factor indicating non-performance or lawful subleasing explicitly, this scenario leans towards being invalid because it doesn't clearly fall under an exception allowing for cancellation.

5. (1 | Y) - The lessee has lawfully subleased the property. This is legally valid as it directly aligns with the first factor, which supports the legality of such actions.

6. (2, 3 | Y) - The lessor cannot assert cancellation against the sublessee due to lawful subleasing, but there's an exception for non-performance. This scenario is complex but leans towards being legally valid because it acknowledges both the general protection of the sublessee and the specific exception for lessee non-performance.

7. (4 | N) - The cancellation is by agreement between the lessor and the lessee, but without any context of lawful subleasing or non-performance, this scenario is invalid as it does not provide sufficient basis to assert cancellation against a potentially lawfully established sublessee arrangement.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - This comprehensive scenario includes lawful subleasing, protection of the sublessee from cancellation assertions, and an exception for lessee non-performance. It is legally valid as it encompasses all aspects of Article 613(3), providing a complete context for evaluation.

9. (1, 4 | Y) - The lessee lawfully subleases, and the cancellation in question is by agreement. This scenario is legally valid because the lawful subleasing provides a foundation for further actions, including potential cancellations by agreement under specific conditions.

10. (2, 3, 4 | N) - In this complex scenario, the lessor cannot assert cancellation against the sublessee, there's an exception for non-performance, and the cancellation is by agreement. However, given that factor 1 (lawful subleasing) is not present to ground these actions in a legitimate subleasing arrangement, and considering the interplay of protections and exceptions might lead to confusion without clear evidence of lawful initial actions, this scenario could be seen as invalid due to potential contradictions or lack of clarity regarding the legitimacy of the sublease.

Each case provides a unique perspective on how different combinations of factors from Article 613(3) can influence the legal validity of juridical acts related to lease agreements and subleases.

 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context of Article 621, let's first factor the article into its key components and then assess how these factors apply to any given query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Damage Cause**: The article specifies that damage caused to the leased thing after it has been received by the lessee (excluding ordinary wear and tear or aging degradation) is a crucial factor.
2. **Lessee's Obligation**: The lessee has an obligation to restore the damaged thing when the lease is terminated if the damage was not due to ordinary use or natural aging.
3. **Exclusion of Liability**: The article provides that the lessee is not liable for damages caused by grounds not attributable to them, implying a consideration of fault or responsibility.
4. **Lease Termination**: The obligation to restore damaged items is specifically tied to the termination of the lease, indicating that this is when such obligations become relevant.
5. **Ordinary Use and Aging Degradation Exemption**: Damage resulting from ordinary use of the leased thing for its intended purpose or natural aging does not trigger the lessee's restoration obligation.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

To assess a query against Article 621, one must consider these factors. If a query aligns with these conditions (e.g., addressing damage outside of ordinary use, considering the termination of the lease, and acknowledging exceptions based on fault), it would logically follow the article's context, warranting a "Y" response. Conversely, if a query ignores or contradicts these key points (for example, by suggesting the lessee is responsible for wear and tear or by not considering the issue of fault), it would not be valid within the article's context, leading to an "N" response.

Given that there's no specific query provided in your prompt to evaluate against Article 621 directly, I'll demonstrate how this process works conceptually. If you have a particular query you'd like assessed against Article 621, please provide it for a direct evaluation.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 621, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The lessee caused damage to the leased thing after receiving it and is obligated to restore it when the lease terminates, making this scenario legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: Since the damage was caused by grounds not attributable to the lessee and resulted from ordinary use or aging degradation, the lessee is not liable for restoration, rendering this scenario invalid.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The occurrence of damage after the lessee received the leased thing, coupled with the lease termination, triggers the obligation to restore, making this scenario legally valid.

4. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although the lessee has an obligation to restore damaged items, if the damage is due to ordinary use or aging degradation, this obligation does not apply, rendering this scenario invalid.

5. (3, 1 | Y) 
Justification: Even though the damage was caused by grounds not attributable to the lessee, if such damage occurred after the lessee received the leased thing, it may still impact the lessee's obligations upon lease termination, making this scenario legally valid.

6. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: Since the damage in question is due to ordinary use or aging degradation and only becomes relevant at lease termination, there is no obligation for the lessee to restore, rendering this scenario invalid.

7. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The occurrence of damage after the lessee received the leased thing, even if not directly attributable to them, may impact their obligations, especially considering fault or responsibility, making this scenario legally valid.

8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The lessee's obligation to restore damaged items when the lease terminates is a direct application of Article 621, given that damage occurred outside ordinary use and aging degradation, making this scenario legally valid.

9. (5, 3 | N) 
Justification: If the damage resulted from ordinary use or aging degradation and was caused by grounds not attributable to the lessee, then the lessee is exempt from restoration obligations, rendering this scenario invalid.

10. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive scenario includes damage cause, lessee's obligation, and lease termination, all of which are central to Article 621, making it legally valid as it directly aligns with the article's stipulations.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 621, ensuring no two cases use the same set of factors. The justification provided for each case determines whether the scenario is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N) based on the occurrence and interaction of these factors within the context of Article 621.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

# Task 1:
Given the query: "If The lessee is not obligated to restore any wear of the leased thing caused by the ordinary manner of using and making profit from it when the lease is terminated."

1. **Damage Cause**: (Query entails 1) - The query mentions damage or wear caused by the ordinary manner of using the leased thing.
2. **Lessee's Obligation**: (Query entails 2) - It discusses the lessee's obligation regarding the restoration of the leased thing.
3. **Exclusion of Liability**: (Query entails 3) - The query implies exclusion of liability for certain types of damage (ordinary wear).
4. **Lease Termination**: (Query entails 4) - It mentions the termination of the lease as a relevant point.
5. **Ordinary Use and Aging Degradation Exemption**: (Query entails 5) - Specifically addresses the exemption for ordinary use and, by extension, aging degradation.

# Task 2:
Given that the query statement aligns with what Article 621 specifies regarding the lessee's obligations and exemptions, particularly concerning ordinary wear and tear, we can conclude: 
(Query Valid) 

This is because the query correctly reflects the legal validity of the lessee not being obligated to restore the leased thing for damages resulting from its ordinary use or aging degradation upon lease termination, as per Article 621.

 To address the given problem, let's first analyze the provided legal article and then evaluate the query against its context.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Mandate Cancellation**: A mandate can be cancelled by either party at any time.
2. **Compensation for Damage**: The party cancelling the mandate must compensate the other party for damage suffered, unless there was a compelling reason for the cancellation.
3. **Detrimental Cancellation**: If the cancellation occurs at a detrimental time for the other party, compensation is required.
4. **Cancellation of Mandate with Shared Interests**: If the mandator cancels a mandate that includes interests for the mandatary (beyond just receiving remuneration), compensation is required unless there was a compelling reason.
5. **Compelling Reason Exemption**: The requirement for compensation does not apply if there was a compelling reason for the cancellation.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we have factored the article into its key components, let's consider how these factors relate to determining whether a query about this article is legally valid. However, without a specific query provided in your request, I'll outline a general approach:

- **Query Validation Approach**: To validate a query against the context of Article 651, one must identify which of the factored components (1 through 5) are relevant to the query. A query is considered legally valid ("Y") if it directly aligns with or logically follows from one or more of these factors without contradicting them. Conversely, a query would be considered invalid ("N") if it contradicts any of the established factors or introduces elements not supported by the article.

Since no specific query was provided for evaluation against Article 651, I'll demonstrate this approach with a hypothetical example:

- **Hypothetical Query**: "If a mandatary suffers damage due to the cancellation of a mandate at a time that is detrimental to them, must they be compensated?"
  
  Following the validation approach:
  - This query directly relates to factors 2 (**Compensation for Damage**) and 3 (**Detrimental Cancellation**).
  - It logically follows from these factors that in such a scenario, the mandatary should indeed be compensated unless there was a compelling reason for the cancellation (factor 5).

Therefore, this hypothetical query would be considered legally valid ("Y") because it aligns with and logically follows from the factors outlined in Article 651.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors from Article 651, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: A mandate is cancelled by one party (factor 1), and since there's no mention of a compelling reason, the cancelling party must compensate for damage suffered by the other party (factor 2), making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: The cancellation occurs at a time that is detrimental to the other party (factor 3), but without any additional factors indicating compensation or a compelling reason, the act could be seen as invalid due to potential harm caused without justification.

3. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A mandate is cancelled by one party (factor 1), and there was a compelling reason for the cancellation (factor 5), which exempts the cancelling party from compensating for damage, thus making the act legally valid.

4. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The party cancelling the mandate must compensate for damage suffered by the other party (factor 2), and the mandate includes interests for the mandatary beyond just receiving remuneration (factor 4), indicating a shared interest that was terminated, which aligns with the requirement for compensation, making the act legally valid.

5. (1, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A mandate is cancelled at a time detrimental to the other party (factors 1 and 3), but there was a compelling reason for the cancellation (factor 5), which justifies the timing and exempts the need for compensation, making the act legally valid.

6. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: The requirement for compensation for damage suffered by the other party (factor 2) is exempted because there was a compelling reason for the cancellation (factor 5). However, without factors indicating a detrimental time or shared interests, the absence of compensation might not align with the spirit of fairness intended by the article, potentially making the act invalid.

7. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The mandate includes interests for the mandatary beyond just receiving remuneration (factor 4), and assuming the cancellation was not at a detrimental time or without a compelling reason, the requirement for compensation would typically apply, but since factor 4 alone does not specify an invalid action, we consider the scenario legally valid under general principles of contract law.

8. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A mandate is cancelled by one party (factor 1), requiring compensation for damage suffered by the other party (factor 2), and the mandate includes shared interests (factor 4). This combination directly aligns with the principles outlined in the article, making the act legally valid as it addresses both the cancellation and the need for compensation.

9. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The cancellation occurs at a detrimental time (factor 3), but there was a compelling reason for the cancellation (factor 5). The presence of a compelling reason justifies the action despite the timing, making the act legally valid due to the exemption from compensation.

10. (1, 2, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario combines all critical aspects - a mandate is cancelled (factor 1), compensation for damage is required (factor 2), the cancellation is at a detrimental time (factor 3), but there's a compelling reason (factor 5). Despite the detrimental timing, the compelling reason justifies the action and potentially exempts the need for compensation, making the act legally valid under the article's provisions.

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement in relation to Article 656, we first need to factor the given article and then evaluate the query against these factors.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Application Scope**: The provisions apply to entrustments of business.
2. **Juridical Acts Exclusion**: These provisions specifically mention entrustments that do not constitute juridical acts.
3. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**: The provisions from another section are applied mutatis mutandis, meaning with necessary changes to apply to the new situation.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 3>

Given the query is about determining if a statement logically follows the legal context provided by Article 656, without a specific query provided, it's challenging to directly answer "Y" or "N". However, we can infer how one might approach evaluating a query against this article.

- If the query pertains to entrustments of business that are not juridical acts and implies an application similar to another section (mutatis mutandis), then it would likely be valid ("Y").
- If the query involves juridical acts or does not pertain to entrustments of business, or if it ignores the mutatis mutandis application principle, it might not logically follow the article's context, leading to an "N".

Since no specific query is given to evaluate against Article 656 directly, a definitive answer cannot be provided. However, this analysis framework can guide the evaluation of any query related to Article 656 by considering the factors of application scope, exclusion of juridical acts, and the principle of mutatis mutandis.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 656:

1. **Application Scope**: The provisions apply to entrustments of business.
2. **Juridical Acts Exclusion**: These provisions specifically mention entrustments that do not constitute juridical acts.
3. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**: The provisions from another section are applied mutatis mutandis, meaning with necessary changes to apply to the new situation.

Here are 10 case scenarios:

1. (1 | Y) - This case involves an entrustment of business that falls under the application scope of Article 656. Given that it directly applies to such situations, the act is considered legally valid.

2. (2 | N) - In this scenario, we're dealing with a juridical act, which is explicitly excluded by the provisions of Article 656 concerning entrustments not constituting juridical acts. Hence, the act is invalid under these specific provisions.

3. (3 | Y) - The application of mutatis mutandis suggests an adaptation of existing provisions to fit new circumstances. If a situation calls for such an application regarding an entrustment of business, it implies a legitimate attempt to apply relevant legal principles, thus likely rendering the act legally valid.

4. (1, 2 | N) - This case combines the application scope with the exclusion of juridical acts. Since the scenario explicitly involves a juridical act, which is excluded by the article's provisions, the act is considered invalid.

5. (1, 3 | Y) - When both the application scope and mutatis mutandis application are relevant, it indicates that the entrustment of business is being handled in accordance with adapted legal principles. This suggests a legitimate approach to applying the law, making the act legally valid.

6. (2, 3 | N) - Although this scenario involves the principle of mutatis mutandis, the primary factor is the exclusion of juridical acts. Since the situation pertains to a juridical act, it falls outside the provisions' intended application, rendering the act invalid.

7. (1, 2, 3 | N) - In this comprehensive scenario, all factors are considered. However, the presence of a juridical act (factor 2) takes precedence due to its explicit exclusion by the article's provisions. Therefore, despite the adapted application (mutatis mutandis), the act remains invalid.

8. (1 | Y) - Similar to case 1, this involves an entrustment of business within the article's scope, implying that the act is legally valid due to direct applicability.

9. (3 | Y) - As seen in case 3, applying provisions mutatis mutandis to fit new circumstances suggests a legitimate legal approach, making the act legally valid.

10. (2 | N) - Reiterating the conclusion from case 2, involving a juridical act excluded by the article's provisions results in an invalid act under these specific legal circumstances.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors to determine the legal validity of the juridical act or obligations based on Article 656.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding Article 649 and its legal validity with a given context, we first need to factor the article into its constituent parts for analysis.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Article Context**: The article discusses the relationship between a mandator (the person giving the mandate) and a mandatary (the person receiving the mandate) in terms of costs incurred during the administration of the mandated business.
2. **Cost Incurring Condition**: Costs will be incurred in administering the mandated business.
3. **Request for Advance**: The mandatary has the right to request an advance from the mandator for these costs.
4. **Mandator's Obligation**: The mandator must pay an advance for the costs at the request of the mandatary.
5. **Business Administration**: The context is specifically about the administration of a mandated business, implying that the costs are related to this administration.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 5

Given these factors and without a specific query provided in your question, I'll create a hypothetical query for illustration: "Is the mandator required to pay costs without being asked by the mandatary?" 

To determine if this query is legally valid with the context of Article 649:
- The article explicitly states that the mandator must pay an advance at the **request** of the mandatary. This implies a condition (the request) must be met before the obligation to pay arises.
- There's no mention of the mandator being obligated to pay without such a request, which suggests that the initiative lies with the mandatary to ask for the advance.

Therefore, based on the factors extracted and the hypothetical query provided for illustration, the answer would be "N" (No), because the article does not support the idea that the mandator must pay costs without being requested to do so by the mandatary. The key factor here is the **Request for Advance**, which is a prerequisite for the mandator's obligation to pay.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors extracted from Article 649:


1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The article context and cost incurring condition are met, indicating that the scenario involves a mandated business where costs will be incurred, thus making the juridical act of requesting an advance legally valid.


2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the request for an advance and the mandator's obligation to pay are present, without the context of the article (factor 1) or the condition of costs being incurred (factor 2), it's unclear if these actions are pertinent to a mandated business, thus making the act potentially invalid.


3. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The cost incurring condition and the administration of the mandated business are present, which aligns with the article's context, suggesting that any costs incurred would be valid for an advance request under Article 649.


4. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: The presence of the article context and the request for an advance does not automatically make the act legally valid without the mandator's obligation to pay or the condition of costs being incurred, which are crucial elements for determining legal validity.


5. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The mandator's obligation to pay and the administration of the mandated business being present suggest that the juridical act is tied to a legitimate business operation under Article 649, thus making it legally valid.


6. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although costs are incurred and there's a request for an advance, without the mandator's obligation to pay or the context of administering a mandated business, the legal validity of such a request is questionable.


7. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The article context and the mandator's obligation to pay being present indicate that the scenario involves a legally recognized relationship between a mandator and a mandatary under Article 649, making the act legally valid.


8. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: A request for an advance in the context of administering a mandated business does not automatically make the juridical act legally valid without the condition of costs being incurred or the article's context being directly applicable.


9. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The cost incurring condition and the mandator's obligation to pay are both crucial elements that, when present, support the legal validity of the juridical act under Article 649, as they align with the obligations outlined in the article.


10. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although the article context and the administration of the mandated business are present, without the condition of costs being incurred or a request for an advance, it's unclear if any juridical act related to Article 649 has occurred, thus making the scenario legally invalid based on the information provided.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 1
The query discusses a scenario where the mandatary may not request costs until after having paid them, which relates to the context of the article about the relationship between a mandator and a mandatary in terms of costs incurred during the administration of the mandated business. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 2
The query mentions costs incurred in administering the mandated business, which directly relates to the condition stated in the article that costs will be incurred. Hence, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 3
The query specifies a condition under which the mandatary may not request an advance until after paying the costs, which is about the request for an advance. Thus, (Query entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 4
The query implies that the mandator's obligation to pay might be affected by the timing of the mandatary's request or actions, relating to the mandator's obligation to pay an advance at the request of the mandatary. So, (Query entails 4).

## Step 5: Assessing Query Entailment for Factor 5
The query is set within the context of administering a mandated business and the costs associated with it, which aligns with the factor about business administration. Therefore, (Query entails 5).

## Step 6: Evaluating Query Validity
Given that the article specifies the mandator must pay an advance at the request of the mandatary and does not explicitly address what happens if the mandatary pays first, the query seems to introduce a scenario not directly covered by the article's explicit wording. However, it does not inherently invalidate the juridical acts or obligations outlined in Article 649; rather, it presents a possible interpretation or application of those principles under specific circumstances. Thus, without direct contradiction to the article's stipulations, (Query Valid).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

1. A mandate can terminate due to specific events such as the death of the mandator or mandatary, an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding against either party, or a decision for the commencement of guardianship against the mandatary.
2. The termination of a mandate due to these grounds cannot be asserted against the other party unless they were notified of or knew about the terminating event.
3. Notification or knowledge of the terminating event is crucial for its validity against the other party in a mandate agreement.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 3>

To assess the legal validity of a query with respect to these articles, we need the specific query to evaluate it against the factored elements. However, based on the provided instructions and examples, I will demonstrate how to apply this process to a hypothetical query:

Query: "If a mandatary dies, the mandate automatically terminates without needing to notify the mandator."

This query seems to logically follow from the first factored element (termination due to death), but it overlooks the importance of notification or knowledge as stated in the second factored element. Thus, considering all factors:

- The termination event (death of the mandatary) is recognized as a valid reason for mandate termination.
- However, the query does not account for the requirement that the other party must be notified of or know about the death to assert the termination effectively.

Given this analysis and without a specific query provided in your request, I'll demonstrate the thought process based on the hypothetical query:

Since the query about automatic termination due to death without notification does not fully align with the necessity for notification or knowledge as per factored element 2, it would be considered invalid under the given legal context. Thus, if this were the actual query, my response would be "N" because it misses a crucial factor regarding notification or knowledge of the terminating event.

However, since no specific query was provided to evaluate directly against the article's context and factored elements, I will not finalize with a "Y" or "N" answer but rather demonstrate the analytical approach based on a hypothetical scenario.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the article and factored elements, I'll generate 10 unique case scenarios to assess the legal validity of each situation.

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The mandatary dies, which is a valid reason for mandate termination as per Article 653(i). Since this event directly terminates the mandate, it's considered legally valid without needing further notification or knowledge from the other party in this context.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: The mandator is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding, but there's no mention of notifying or the other party knowing about this event. According to Article 655, the grounds of termination may not be asserted against the other party unless they were notified of or knew of the same, making this scenario invalid due to lack of notification.

3. (3 | Y) 
Justification: The mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship, which directly terminates the mandate as per Article 653(iii). This event is clear and direct in its legal implications, making the termination legally valid without further conditions.

4. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Both the mandator and mandatary are subject to events that could terminate the mandate (death of one party and bankruptcy proceedings against the other), but there's no indication that either party was notified or knew about both events. Given Article 655's requirement for notification or knowledge, asserting termination based on these grounds without proper awareness by both parties makes this scenario invalid.

5. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: The mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship, and the mandator is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding. However, similar to previous scenarios, if neither party was notified or knew about the other's situation, they cannot assert the termination effectively against each other, making this scenario invalid.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The mandatary dies, and there's also a decision for the commencement of guardianship against the mandatary. Both events are direct grounds for termination under Article 653. Even though the death would have already terminated the mandate, the additional factor of guardianship doesn't change the outcome since the first event (death) is enough to terminate the mandate legally.

7. (1 | N) 
Justification: This scenario seems to contradict the previous understanding because it suggests that the mandatary's death alone might not be enough without considering Article 655 about notification or knowledge. However, upon closer inspection, this case assumes a very narrow interpretation where the focus is solely on whether the event of death (factor 1) can stand alone as a reason for termination without any mention of notification or knowledge. In practice, the occurrence of death would indeed terminate the mandate, but if we strictly adhere to the need for notification or knowledge as per Article 655 for asserting this termination against the other party, and assuming no such notification or knowledge occurred, then technically, this could be seen as invalid in a strict legal argument focusing on the process of assertion rather than the fact of termination.

8. (2 | Y) 
Justification: The mandator is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding, and it's assumed that the mandatary was notified or knew about this event. Given Article 655's stipulation that notification or knowledge is necessary for asserting the grounds of termination against the other party, with this condition met, the scenario would be considered legally valid.

9. (3 | N) 
Justification: The mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship, but there's an assumption that the mandator was not notified or did not know about this event. Similar to previous scenarios emphasizing the importance of notification or knowledge, without the mandator being aware of the guardianship decision, they cannot effectively assert the termination based on this ground against the other party, making this scenario invalid.

10. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: All possible grounds for termination are met (death of a party, bankruptcy proceedings against another, and a decision for the commencement of guardianship against the mandatary), and it's assumed that all parties were notified or knew about these events. Given that Article 653 directly addresses the first condition and Article 655 is satisfied through notification or knowledge, this comprehensive scenario ensures that the termination can be legally asserted by both parties, making it valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors to assess legal validity based on the articles provided.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing the Query for Factor 1
The query discusses a mandate being terminated due to the mandator becoming subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceedings, which directly relates to factor 1. This factor states that a mandate can terminate due to specific events such as the death of the mandator or mandatary, an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding against either party, or a decision for the commencement of guardianship against the mandatary. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing the Query for Factor 2
The query also mentions that the mandator may not assert the termination against the mandatary unless the mandatary was notified of or knew about the fact that the mandator is subject to the order commencing bankruptcy proceeding. This aligns with factor 2, which states that the termination of a mandate due to these grounds cannot be asserted against the other party unless they were notified of or knew about the terminating event. Hence, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing the Query for Factor 3
Factor 3 emphasizes the importance of notification or knowledge of the terminating event for its validity against the other party in a mandate agreement. The query directly addresses this by specifying that the mandatary must be notified of or know about the bankruptcy proceedings to assert the termination, which means it also entails factor 3. Thus, (Query entails 3).

## Step 4: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query correctly identifies a valid ground for mandate termination (bankruptcy proceedings) and properly acknowledges the necessity of notification or knowledge for asserting this termination against the other party, it demonstrates an understanding of the legal principles outlined in the articles. Therefore, the query does not introduce any contradictions to the provided legal context but rather applies it accurately to a specific scenario.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a given query is legally valid with the context of Article 676(2), we must first factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Partnership Property**: The article discusses property that belongs to a partnership.
2. **Claim Included in Partnership Property**: A claim is something that can be included as part of the partnership's assets or interests.
3. **Partner's Interest in the Claim**: Each partner has an interest or share in the claims that are part of the partnership property.
4. **Independent Exercise of Rights**: The article specifies that a partner cannot act alone to exercise rights related to a claim within the partnership property.
5. **Restriction on Individual Partner Actions**: This implies there's a limitation on how individual partners can act regarding partnership assets without presumably the consent or agreement of other partners or adherence to partnership agreements.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given the factored components, we need to assess if a query about a partner independently exercising rights over a claim within the partnership property is valid. The critical factor here is **"Independent Exercise of Rights"** and how it relates to a partner's ability to act alone regarding claims within the partnership.

Since Article 676(2) explicitly states that "A partner may not independently exercise the rights with regard to a claim that is included in the partnership property based on that partner's interest in the claim," any query suggesting or implying that a partner can do so would contradict this rule. 

Therefore, without seeing the specific query but understanding it must relate to whether a partner can act independently regarding claims within the partnership property, if the query suggests a partner can indeed take such independent action, it would not logically follow the legal context provided by Article 676(2), leading to an answer of **"N"**. However, if the query aligns with the restrictions imposed by the article, acknowledging that partners cannot independently exercise rights over partnership claims, then it would be considered valid in the context of the article, resulting in a response of **"Y"**.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factored components of Article 676(2), I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: A partner has an interest in a claim within the partnership property but tries to exercise rights independently based solely on their interest and the fact that it's partnership property. This action is restricted by Article 676(2), making it invalid.

2. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: A claim is included in the partnership property, and a partner attempts to independently exercise rights over it. Since Article 676(2) prohibits independent action regarding claims within the partnership property, this act is invalid.

3. (1, 2, 5 | N) 
Justification: Considering the partnership property, a claim included within it, and the restriction on individual partner actions, if a partner still tries to act independently, they would violate Article 676(2), making the action invalid.

4. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A partner recognizes their interest in a claim and the restriction on independent actions. By adhering to these principles and not acting alone, their decision aligns with Article 676(2), making it valid.

5. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Given the context of partnership property and the attempt to independently exercise rights over a claim, this action directly contradicts Article 676(2), rendering it invalid.

6. (2, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Acknowledging a claim is part of the partnership assets, recognizing one's interest in the claim, and adhering to the restrictions on independent partner actions all align with Article 676(2). Thus, an action that respects these boundaries is valid.

7. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: If a partner attempts to independently exercise rights over a partnership claim while aware of the restrictions on individual actions, this attempt violates Article 676(2), making it invalid.

8. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Knowing that a claim is part of the partnership property but attempting to act independently regarding this claim goes against Article 676(2), which prohibits such independent actions, rendering the act invalid.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Recognizing one's interest in a partnership claim and then trying to exercise rights independently over it contradicts Article 676(2). This makes the action invalid as it disregards the prohibition on independent exercises of rights.

10. (1, 2, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Considering all factors - the partnership property, a claim within it, a partner's interest in the claim, and the restrictions on individual actions - if a partner acts in accordance with these principles and does not attempt to independently exercise rights, their action is valid according to Article 676(2).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address both tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the query "A partner may independently exercise the rights with regard to a monetary claim that is included in the partnership property in proportion to each co-owner's interest," we can assess its relation to the factors listed:

1. **Partnership Property**: The query mentions "partnership property," so it entails this factor.
2. **Claim Included in Partnership Property**: It talks about a "monetary claim" within the partnership property, so it entails this factor as well.
3. **Partner's Interest in the Claim**: The query discusses exercising rights "in proportion to each co-owner's interest," which directly relates to a partner's interest in the claim, thus entailing this factor.
4. **Independent Exercise of Rights**: The query explicitly mentions a partner may "independently exercise the rights," which aligns with this factor.
5. **Restriction on Individual Partner Actions**: However, the query seems to contradict the spirit of this restriction by suggesting independent action is permissible under certain conditions.

Therefore, the outputs for Task 1 are:
- (Query entails 1)
- (Query entails 2)
- (Query entails 3)
- (Query entails 4)
- (Query not entails 5)

### Task 2:
The query suggests that a partner can independently exercise rights over a claim within the partnership property "in proportion to each co-owner's interest." This directly contradicts Article 676(2), which states that a partner may not independently exercise such rights based on their interest in the claim. Therefore, the action described in the query is explicitly determined to be legally invalid according to the provided legal context.

Output for Task 2:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement based on Article 670, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Decision Making**: Partnership business is decided by the majority of the partners.
2. **Execution**: The partnership business is executed by each partner.
3. **Delegation**: Decision-making and execution can be delegated to one or more partners or a third party based on the partnership contract.
4. **Majority Rule in Delegation**: If there are multiple persons executing the business, decisions are made by the majority of these persons.
5. **Execution by Delegates**: Each person delegated to execute the business is responsible for its execution.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we have factored the article into its core components, we can now address any query regarding its legal validity by comparing it against these factors.


However, without a specific query provided to test against Article 670, I will demonstrate how one might approach validating a query based on this article. For instance, if the query were "Partnership business is always decided and executed by all partners," we could analyze it as follows:

- This statement contradicts factor 3 (**Delegation**), which allows for decision-making and execution to be delegated.
- It also does not fully align with factor 1 (**Decision Making**) and factor 2 (**Execution**), as the default is majority decision but execution is by each partner, yet it overlooks the possibility of delegation.

Thus, without a specific query, I've illustrated how one might approach determining legal validity based on Article 670's factors. If you provide a specific sentence or query to evaluate, I can directly assess its validity against these factors.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors of Article 670, we will systematically combine these factors in various ways to assess the legal validity of different juridical acts. The factors are:

1. **Decision Making**: Partnership business is decided by the majority of the partners.
2. **Execution**: The partnership business is executed by each partner.
3. **Delegation**: Decision-making and execution can be delegated to one or more partners or a third party based on the partnership contract.
4. **Majority Rule in Delegation**: If there are multiple persons executing the business, decisions are made by the majority of these persons.
5. **Execution by Delegates**: Each person delegated to execute the business is responsible for its execution.

Here are 10 case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | Y) - In this scenario, the partnership business is decided by the majority of partners and executed by each partner. This directly aligns with the default operations outlined in Article 670, making the act legally valid.

2. (3 | N) - If decision-making and execution are delegated without specifying to whom or under what conditions, it contradicts the requirement for clear delegation as per the partnership contract, rendering the act invalid.

3. (1, 3 | Y) - The majority of partners decide on the business, and then they delegate its execution. This combines initial decision-making with the allowed practice of delegation, making the act valid.

4. (2, 4 | Y) - Each partner executes the business, but in cases of delegated execution, decisions are made by the majority of those executing. This scenario respects both individual execution and the majority rule in delegation, making it valid.

5. (5 | Y) - If each person delegated to execute the business does so responsibly, this directly aligns with the provisions for execution by delegates, rendering the act legally valid.

6. (1, 4 | Y) - The partnership business is decided by the majority of partners, and in cases of multiple executors, decisions are made by their majority. This respects both initial decision-making processes and delegated decision-making rules, making it valid.

7. (2, 3 | N) - If every partner must execute the business but then all decision-making and execution are delegated without clear guidelines or to a single entity, this could contradict the principle of individual execution and unclear delegation, potentially rendering the act invalid.

8. (1, 5 | Y) - Decisions are made by the majority of partners, and those delegated to execute do so responsibly. This scenario respects both decision-making and responsible execution, making it valid.

9. (3, 4 | Y) - Decision-making and execution are delegated, and among the delegates, decisions are made by their majority. This scenario aligns with allowed practices of delegation and majority rule within delegated groups, making it valid.

10. (2, 5 | Y) - Each partner executes the business, and those delegated to do so act responsibly. This respects individual execution responsibilities and the responsible actions of delegates, making the act legally valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 670, assessing whether the described juridical acts or obligations are legally valid based on the article's provisions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement given Article 678(2), let's break down the process step by step as instructed.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Partnership Duration Specified**: The article mentions that the duration of the partnership is specified, indicating that there is an agreed-upon length for the partnership.
2. **Right to Withdrawal**: Each partner has the right to withdraw from the partnership if there is a compelling reason to do so, regardless of the specified duration.
3. **Compelling Reason Required**: The withdrawal is conditional on the existence of a compelling reason, which implies that not all reasons for withdrawal are valid under this article.
4. **No Specification of Compelling Reasons**: The article does not specify what constitutes a compelling reason, leaving it open to interpretation or definition elsewhere in the legal framework.
5. **Impact on Partnership Duration**: The article suggests flexibility in the partnership's duration based on individual partners' actions and circumstances.

Given these factors, let's analyze the query: "Each partner may withdraw if there is a compelling reason to do so." This statement aligns with factor 2 (**Right to Withdrawal**) and factor 3 (**Compelling Reason Required**), as it directly reflects the content of Article 678(2).

Since the query directly follows from the information provided in the article, especially considering factors 2 and 3 which explicitly mention the right to withdraw under certain conditions, we conclude that the query is legally valid within the context of Article 678(2).


### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

The final answer is: Y
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 678(2), I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of the factors. Here they are:


1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The partnership duration is specified, and each partner has the right to withdraw, making the withdrawal legally valid if a compelling reason exists.


2. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: Without a clear definition of what constitutes a compelling reason and no specification of the reasons, it's impossible to determine the validity of the withdrawal, thus rendering it invalid.


3. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The specified partnership duration and the existence of a compelling reason allow for a partner to withdraw legally.


4. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: Each partner's right to withdraw and the flexibility in partnership duration due to individual actions make the withdrawal legally valid if a compelling reason is present.


5. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: The lack of specification on compelling reasons combined with the impact on partnership duration introduces too much uncertainty, making the withdrawal invalid without further clarification.


6. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: Although the compelling reasons are not specified, the fact that the partnership duration is specified and there's an implied understanding of what might constitute a compelling reason allows for legal withdrawal.


7. (2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: With the right to withdraw, a compelling reason, and acknowledging the lack of specification on such reasons, the withdrawal can still be considered legally valid as it aligns with the article's intent.


8. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: The specified partnership duration and the flexibility in its length due to individual partner actions support the legality of withdrawal if a compelling reason is given.


9. (3, 5 | N)
Justification: A compelling reason is required for withdrawal, but without clear guidelines on what constitutes such a reason and considering the impact on partnership duration, the withdrawal cannot be deemed legally valid.


10. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: All factors being present—specified partnership duration, right to withdraw, compelling reason required, lack of specification on compelling reasons, and flexibility in partnership duration—still allow for a legally valid withdrawal if a partner can demonstrate a genuine compelling reason for doing so.


Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a clear verdict based on Article 678(2).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address both tasks as defined:


### Task 1:
The query "Even if the duration of the partnership is specified, each partner may withdraw if there is a compelling reason to do so" directly relates to several factors listed. Specifically:

- (Query entails 1) because it mentions the scenario where the duration of the partnership is specified.
- (Query entails 2) as it talks about the right of each partner to withdraw.
- (Query entails 3) since it conditions this withdrawal on the existence of a compelling reason.
- (Query entails 4) is not directly applicable because the query does not delve into what constitutes a compelling reason, but it implies the necessity of such a reason, which aligns with the spirit of factor 4 without explicitly entailing it.
- (Query entails 5) because it touches on the flexibility in partnership duration based on individual actions and circumstances.


### Task 2:
Given that the query directly reflects the content of Article 678(2) without introducing any contradictions or conditions not stated in the article, we can conclude that the statement is an accurate representation of what is legally permissible according to the article. Therefore, the answer to whether the query is valid in terms of legal expression is affirmative.

To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we first need to break down the article into its core components or factors. The provided article is Article 677-2 (2), which states that a partner admitted to a partnership after it is formed is not liable for obligations that arose before their admission.

1. **Partnership Formation**: The article implies that a partnership has already been formed.
2. **Admission of New Partner**: A new partner can be admitted to the partnership after its formation.
3. **Liability for Obligations**: There's a distinction in liability based on when a partner joins, specifically regarding obligations that arose before their admission.
4. **Exemption from Prior Obligations**: A partner admitted after the partnership's formation is exempt from liabilities that accrued before they joined.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, to assess whether a query logically follows from this article, we would need the specific query in question. However, based on the structure provided and the requirement to evaluate queries against the factored components of the legal articles:

- If a query addresses the liability of partners in relation to when they joined the partnership and the obligations incurred before their admission, it could potentially be valid (Y) if it aligns with the factors outlined.
- If a query introduces elements not covered by these factors or contradicts them, it would likely be invalid (N).

Without a specific query to evaluate against Article 677-2 (2), we cannot provide a definitive Y or N response. The factors listed above provide the foundation for assessing any query related to this article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 677-2 (2), I will generate 10 case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: If a partnership has been formed and a new partner is admitted, this scenario aligns with the conditions under which the article operates, making the juridical act of admitting a new partner legally valid.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When there's a distinction in liability based on when a partner joins and an exemption from prior obligations for new partners, these factors directly apply to determining liability, thus making the obligations aligned with these conditions legally valid.

3. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: If only the partnership formation and the concept of liability for obligations are considered without the context of admitting a new partner or the exemption from prior obligations, it's not possible to determine the validity of the juridical act directly from the article, as key factors are missing.

4. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The admission of a new partner after formation coupled with the exemption from liabilities that accrued before their joining directly aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 677-2 (2), making such an arrangement legally valid.

5. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although this combination includes partnership formation, admission of a new partner, and liability for obligations, it lacks the crucial factor of exemption from prior obligations. Without this, the article's direct application is incomplete, potentially making the act invalid due to missing critical context.

6. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Knowing only that a partnership has been formed and that there's an exemption from prior obligations for new partners doesn't provide enough information about when the partner joined or how liabilities are generally handled, leading to uncertainty and potential invalidity.

7. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The admission of a new partner after formation and the distinction in liability based on joining time directly relate to the article's conditions. This suggests that obligations could be legally valid if they align with these principles.

8. (1, 2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes all necessary elements: partnership formation, admission of a new partner after formation, and exemption from prior obligations. This directly matches the scenario described in Article 677-2 (2), making the juridical act legally valid.

9. (3, 4 | N) is corrected to reflect an error in previous justification logic; given factors about liability distinction and exemption, these indeed are crucial for determining validity based on Article 677-2 (2). Thus, correction: (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: The presence of a liability distinction based on the time of joining and the exemption from prior obligations directly pertains to the article's stipulations, indicating that such arrangements could be legally valid under the conditions specified.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario includes all factors outlined in Article 677-2 (2): partnership formation, admission of a new partner after formation, distinction in liability based on joining time, and exemption from prior obligations for new partners. This comprehensive alignment makes the juridical act or obligations legally valid.

Each case has been carefully constructed to ensure no two use the same combination of factors, providing a clear verdict based on the article's stipulations.

The query states, "A new partner that is admitted to a partnership after it is formed is not liable to perform the obligations of the partnership that arose before that partner's admission."

## Step 2: Evaluating Factor 1 - Partnership Formation
The query implies that a partnership has already been formed because it discusses a new partner being admitted after the formation. Thus, (Query entails 1).

## Step 3: Evaluating Factor 2 - Admission of New Partner
The query directly mentions a new partner being admitted to the partnership after its formation. Therefore, (Query entails 2).

## Step 4: Evaluating Factor 3 - Liability for Obligations
The query addresses the liability of a new partner concerning obligations that arose before their admission. Hence, (Query entails 3).

## Step 5: Evaluating Factor 4 - Exemption from Prior Obligations
The query explicitly states that a new partner is not liable to perform obligations that arose before their admission. So, (Query entails 4).

## Step 6: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query aligns with all factors outlined in Article 677-2 (2) and directly reflects its content without introducing any contradictory or invalid points regarding juridical acts or obligations, we can conclude on the validity of the query.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 ### Begin Factoring
To analyze the given query and article, we first need to break down the information into its core components or factors:

1. **Partnership Property**: The property that belongs to a partnership.
2. **Liquidation**: The process of converting assets into cash to pay off debts or to distribute among partners when the partnership is dissolved.
3. **Division of Partnership Property**: The act of splitting the partnership's assets among its partners.
4. **Restriction on Seeking Division Before Liquidation**: A rule that prohibits partners from seeking the division of partnership property before the liquidation process has been completed.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given these factors, we can analyze the query in relation to Article 676(3). The article clearly states that a partner may not seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation. This directly corresponds with factor 4, **Restriction on Seeking Division Before Liquidation**.

The query essentially asks if seeking division before liquidation is allowed under the given legal context. Since Article 676(3) explicitly prohibits this action by stating "A partner may not seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation," any query asking about the validity of seeking such division before liquidation would logically be invalid based on the provided article.

Therefore, considering the factors and the explicit prohibition in Article 676(3), if a query suggests that a partner can seek the division of partnership property before liquidation, it does not logically follow the legal context provided. Hence, the response should reflect that the query is not valid according to the given article.

The answer is: N
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 676(3) and the factors described, here are 10 case scenarios with their respective justifications:

1. (1 | N) 
Justification: The presence of partnership property alone does not determine the validity of seeking division before liquidation. Article 676(3) specifically prohibits seeking division before liquidation, so without considering the process of liquidation or the act of division itself, the case remains invalid.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: Liquidation by itself doesn't make seeking division valid if it hasn't occurred yet. According to Article 676(3), a partner cannot seek division before this process is completed.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: The act of dividing partnership property without considering the liquidation process or the restriction on seeking division before liquidation makes the case invalid, as per Article 676(3).

4. (4 | N) 
Justification: Knowing there's a restriction on seeking division before liquidation directly points to the content of Article 676(3), which prohibits such action, making any attempt to do so invalid.

5. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Having partnership property and undergoing liquidation does not automatically allow for division before the liquidation is completed, as per Article 676(3).

6. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: The presence of partnership property and the act of dividing it among partners still falls under the restriction of Article 676(3), which prohibits seeking division before liquidation.

7. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Even if there's a process of liquidation happening and an attempt to divide the partnership property, Article 676(3) explicitly states that division cannot be sought before liquidation is completed.

8. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Recognizing the existence of partnership property and the restriction on seeking division before liquidation clearly indicates that attempting such division would be against Article 676(3), thus invalid.

9. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The process of liquidation and awareness of the restriction on early division do not change the fact that Article 676(3) prohibits seeking division before liquidation is completed.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Even with all factors present—partnership property exists, there's a process of liquidation, an attempt to divide the property, and awareness of the restriction—Article 676(3) explicitly prohibits seeking division before liquidation is completed. Therefore, any such attempt remains invalid.

Each case scenario leads to the conclusion that attempting to seek the division of partnership property before liquidation, under the conditions described by Article 676(3) and its factors, results in an invalid juridical act or obligation.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing the Query for Factor Inclusion
The query states, "A partner may seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation if the consent of the majority of partners exists." This statement directly relates to the factors included in our analysis, particularly factor 4, **Restriction on Seeking Division Before Liquidation**. However, it introduces a condition (consent of the majority of partners) not explicitly mentioned in Article 676(3).

## Step 2: Evaluating Factor Presence
Given that the query discusses seeking division before liquidation with a specific condition, it implies the presence of factor 4, as it deals with the concept of dividing partnership property before liquidation. Thus, we can conclude that (Query entails 4), because it involves the idea of seeking division before liquidation, even though it adds an additional condition not covered by Article 676(3).

## Step 3: Determining Query Validity
Article 676(3) clearly states that a partner may not seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation. The query suggests that this can be done with the consent of the majority of partners, which is not addressed in the provided article. Since Article 676(3) does not specify any conditions under which seeking division before liquidation would be allowed, and given its absolute prohibition, we must consider the query as attempting to introduce a condition not recognized by the article. Therefore, based on the information provided, the query's suggestion does not align with the explicit prohibition stated in Article 676(3), leading us to conclude that (Query Invalid).

<Number of factors : 5>

To evaluate the validity of a query regarding this article, we would need the specific query to assess whether it aligns with these factors. However, given the structure provided and without a specific query to analyze, I will demonstrate how one might approach determining legal validity based on an example query.

Example Query: "If someone pays a debt early by mistake, can they demand the return of their payment?"

Analysis:
- Factor 1 (obligations not yet due) is relevant because it sets the context for premature payments.
- Factor 2 (premature payments) applies as the scenario involves an early payment.
- Factor 3 (general rule against return) is present but does not directly apply due to the specific circumstances.
- Factor 4 (exception for mistakes) and Factor 5 (obligee's duty to return benefits from mistaken payments) are crucial because they provide a basis for demanding the return of a premature payment if it was made by mistake.

Given these factors, the query seems to align with the legal context provided, as it involves a situation where an exception to the general rule might apply. Therefore, without a specific query to evaluate against the article's context but using the example query for illustration:

The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor has made a payment for an obligation that has not yet fallen due (Factor 1), and this payment is considered premature (Factor 2). However, since there's no mention of it being made by mistake, the general rule applies, and the payment cannot be demanded back. Thus, the juridical act of making the premature payment is legally valid.

2. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The obligor generally cannot demand back a premature payment or delivery (Factor 3), but an exception exists if it was made by mistake (Factor 4). If the payment was indeed made by error, then the juridical act of seeking its return could be considered legally valid under this exception.

3. (5 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee must return the benefit gained from a mistaken payment or delivery (Factor 5). Since this factor directly addresses a situation where an exception to the general rule applies, and the obligee has a duty to rectify the mistake, the juridical act of returning the benefit is legally valid.

4. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: The obligation has not yet fallen due (Factor 1), and generally, premature payments cannot be demanded back (Factor 3). Without any exception applying (like a mistake), attempting to demand the return of such a payment would be invalid.

5. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A premature payment was made (Factor 2), and it was done by mistake (Factor 4). Given that an exception exists for mistaken payments, seeking the return of such a payment could be legally valid.

6. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The obligation is not yet due (Factor 1), but the payment was made by mistake (implied for Factor 5 to apply). Since the obligee must return benefits from mistaken payments, the act of returning or seeking the return of the premature payment due to mistake is legally valid.

7. (3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Generally, premature payments cannot be returned (Factor 3), but if a payment was made by mistake, the obligee has a duty to return the benefit gained (Factor 5). This combination indicates an exception to the general rule applies, making the act of returning or seeking the return of the mistaken payment legally valid.

8. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The payment is premature (Factor 2), and since it's implied that it was made by mistake for Factor 5 to apply (the obligee must return the benefit), the juridical act of returning or seeking the return of such a payment due to the mistake is legally valid.

9. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The obligation has not yet fallen due (Factor 1), and the payment was made by mistake (Factor 4). Given that an exception exists for mistaken payments, attempting to demand its return could be considered legally valid under this specific circumstance.

10. (4 | N) 
Justification: While an exception exists if a payment or delivery was made by mistake (Factor 4), without any other context (like the obligation being premature or the obligee's duty to return benefits), claiming an exception without evidence of a mistake does not inherently make demanding the return of a payment legally valid. It lacks sufficient context for a definitive yes, but given it's about mistakes which are exceptions, it could misleadingly suggest validity without additional factors.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and their implications on the legal validity of the juridical act in question, ensuring no two cases use the same combination of factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the given tasks based on the provided article and query:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "A person who misunderstands due to negligence that the due date arrives and has paid money or delivered anything as performance of an obligation that has not yet fallen due may demand the return of the money paid or thing delivered before the arrival of the due date."

- (Query entails 1) because it discusses obligations not yet due.
- (Query entails 2) since it involves payment or delivery made before the obligation's due date.
- (Query entails 3) as it generally refers to a situation where return is being considered under normal premature payment conditions.
- (Query does not entail 4) because it specifies misunderstanding due to negligence, not a mistake in the context of the article which implies an unintended action rather than negligence.
- (Query does not entail 5) since the scenario described doesn't directly imply that the obligee must return the benefit gained due to the nature of the error being negligence rather than a genuine mistake.

### Task 2:
Given the analysis, the query seems to misunderstand the legal principle as outlined in the article. The article suggests that if an obligor pays by mistake, they may demand return, but it does not cover situations where the payment was made due to negligence about the due date. Thus, based on the provided information and the nature of the query:

(Query Invalid)

This conclusion is reached because the scenario described in the query (negligence about the due date) does not align with the exceptions outlined in the article for demanding the return of premature payments or deliveries.

 ### Begin Factoring
To analyze the query's validity, we must break down the given article into its core components or factors. The article discusses a situation where a non-obligor mistakenly performs an obligation and the conditions under which they may not demand the return of what they performed.

1. **Performance by a Non-Obligor**: A person who is not obligated to perform an action does so mistakenly.
2. **Good Faith Action by Obligee**: The obligee acts in good faith regarding the instrument or claim (e.g., allows the instrument to be lost, damages it, waives security, or lets the claim expire through prescription).
3. **Consequences for the Non-Obligor**: The non-obligor cannot demand the return of what they performed under the specified conditions.
4. **Mistake in Performance**: The performance is done by mistake, implying a lack of obligation on the part of the performer.
5. **Obligee's Actions Impacting the Claim**: The obligee's actions (loss, damage, waiver, or prescription) affect the validity or enforceability of the claim.

Given these factors, we must evaluate whether a query logically follows from them to determine its legal validity within the context provided.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

To answer your prompt accurately, I need the specific query related to Article 707(1) that you'd like me to validate against the article's content. Without this query, I can only provide the factored analysis as requested. Please provide the query for a final determination of "Y" or "N".
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided for Article 707(1), I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of these factors occurred and provide a justification determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

### Case Scenarios:

1. **Performance by a Non-Obligor, Mistake in Performance** | N
   - Justification: A non-obligor performs an obligation mistakenly. Since this involves only factors 1 and 4 without the obligee's actions affecting the claim, it does not directly fall under Article 707(1)'s conditions for preventing a demand for return. However, considering the principle behind the article, if there are no consequences from the obligee's actions (factors 2 and 5), the non-obligor might still seek restitution based on the mistake, suggesting an invalidation of their claim under specific circumstances not fully covered by this subset of factors.

2. **Good Faith Action by Obligee, Consequences for the Non-Obligor** | N
   - Justification: If the obligee acts in good faith (factor 2) and this leads to consequences for the non-obligor (factor 3), without the initial mistake or performance (factors 1 and 4), it doesn't directly apply to Article 707(1). The focus is on the obligee's actions and their impact, suggesting that without a performance by a non-obligor, there's no basis for demanding return under these conditions.

3. **Mistake in Performance, Obligee's Actions Impacting the Claim** | N
   - Justification: When a mistake leads to performance (factor 4) and the obligee's actions impact the claim (factor 5), without the non-obligor's initial action or good faith from the obligee, it creates a scenario where the validity of demanding return is questionable. The article suggests that such actions by the obligee could bar recovery under certain conditions, but this combination doesn't perfectly align with Article 707(1)'s criteria.

4. **Performance by a Non-Obligor, Good Faith Action by Obligee** | N
   - Justification: If a non-obligor performs an obligation (factor 1) and the obligee acts in good faith regarding the instrument or claim (factor 2), but without considering the mistake, consequences, or impact on the claim, this scenario partially meets Article 707(1)'s conditions. The absence of factors directly related to the performance's validity and its consequences means the non-obligor might not be entirely barred from demanding return.

5. **Consequences for the Non-Obligor, Obligee's Actions Impacting the Claim** | N
   - Justification: When there are consequences for the non-obligor (factor 3) due to the obligee's actions impacting the claim (factor 5), but without a performance by mistake or good faith action explicitly mentioned, it implies that any demand for return would be subject to the conditions set by these actions. This scenario doesn't fully fit Article 707(1)'s criteria because it lacks direct reference to a mistaken performance.

6. **Mistake in Performance, Consequences for the Non-Obligor** | N
   - Justification: A mistake leading to performance (factor 4) and consequences for the non-obligor (factor 3) suggest that while there was an error, the focus is on the outcome for the non-obligor. Without considering the good faith of the obligee or their actions impacting the claim, this scenario indicates a potential bar to demanding return based on the mistake alone.

7. **Performance by a Non-Obligor, Obligee's Actions Impacting the Claim** | N
   - Justification: When a non-obligor performs (factor 1) and the obligee's actions impact the claim (factor 5), but without good faith or consequences explicitly mentioned, it suggests that the validity of demanding return would depend on how these factors interplay. This combination doesn't perfectly match Article 707(1)'s conditions.

8. **Good Faith Action by Obligee, Mistake in Performance** | N
   - Justification: If there's a good faith action by the obligee (factor 2) and a mistake in performance (factor 4), but no initial performance by a non-obligor or consequences for them, it indicates that while there was an error, the obligee's actions could influence the outcome. This scenario doesn't directly fall under Article 707(1) because it lacks key elements.

9. **Performance by a Non-Obligor, Consequences for the Non-Obligor, Mistake in Performance** | N
   - Justification: With a performance by a non-obligor (factor 1), consequences for them (factor 3), and a mistake in performance (factor 4), this scenario closely aligns with Article 707(1)'s conditions. The absence of good faith from the obligee or their actions impacting the claim means that while there's a basis for considering the demand invalid, it doesn't fully meet the article's criteria.

10. **All Factors: Performance by a Non-Obligor, Good Faith Action by Obligee, Consequences for the Non-Obligor, Mistake in Performance, Obligee's Actions Impacting the Claim** | N
    - Justification: This scenario includes all factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), perfectly aligning with Article 707(1)'s conditions. A non-obligor performs by mistake, the obligee acts in good faith but in a way that impacts the claim, leading to consequences for the non-obligor. According to Article 707(1), under these specific conditions, the person performing the obligation may not demand the return of what they performed, indicating the juridical act is invalid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 707(1), and based on the justifications provided, determines whether the juridical act or obligations are legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we must first break down the article into its key components or factors and then analyze these factors in relation to the query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Type of Obligations**: The article mentions two types of obligations where set-off cannot be duly asserted by the obligor against the obligee: (i) obligations for compensation due to loss or damage from a tort committed in bad faith, and (ii) obligations for compensation due to loss or damage for death or injury to person.
2. **Exception to Set-off Restriction**: The article provides an exception where the set-off restriction does not apply if the obligee acquires the claim corresponding to the relevant obligation from another person.
3. **Set-off Definition**: Implicitly, a set-off refers to the right of an obligor to reduce or extinguish their debt by claiming a credit against their creditor (obligee).
4. **Tort Committed in Bad Faith**: This specifies a condition under which compensation for loss or damage cannot be subject to set-off, emphasizing the intentional wrongdoing.
5. **Compensation for Death or Injury**: Another specific condition where set-off is restricted, focusing on damages related to personal harm or death.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors and without a specific query provided in your prompt, I'll create a hypothetical query to demonstrate how one might assess its legal validity based on the article:

Hypothetical Query: "An obligor who has caused injury to another person through negligence can assert a set-off against the injured party's claim for compensation."

To evaluate this query:
- It involves an **obligation for compensation due to loss or damage for death or injury to person**, which aligns with factor 1 (Type of Obligations).
- There is no mention of acquiring the claim from another person, so the exception in factor 2 does not apply.
- The scenario directly relates to a situation where set-off is restricted according to the article.

Based on these considerations, the query would be considered **N** (Not valid) because it attempts to assert a set-off in a situation explicitly restricted by the article. The article clearly states that for obligations related to compensation for loss or damage due to death or injury to person, the obligor may not duly assert a set-off against the obligee, except under specific conditions not met in this hypothetical query.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 509, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: This case involves an obligation for compensation due to loss or damage from a tort committed in bad faith and implies a set-off situation. Since there's no exception mentioned (like acquiring the claim from another person), asserting a set-off is not valid.

2. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: In this scenario, the obligee acquires the claim from another person, which aligns with the exception for obligations related to compensation for death or injury to person. Thus, the set-off can be duly asserted, making it legally valid.

3. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: This case involves a tort committed in bad faith and specifies the condition of intentional wrongdoing. Given that there's no mention of an exception, asserting a set-off against such an obligation is not legally valid.

4. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although this scenario involves a clear definition of set-off and compensation for death or injury to person, it doesn't meet the criteria for an exception (acquiring the claim from another). Therefore, asserting a set-off in this case is not legally valid.

5. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee has acquired the claim from another person, which falls under the exception for obligations related to torts committed in bad faith. This makes the assertion of a set-off legally valid.

6. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This complex scenario involves an obligation for compensation due to loss or damage from a tort, the acquisition of a claim from another person, and implies a set-off situation. Given that it includes the exception (acquiring the claim), asserting a set-off can be legally valid.

7. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: This case involves both a tort committed in bad faith and compensation for death or injury to person but lacks any mention of an exception. Therefore, asserting a set-off is not legally valid.

8. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The scenario includes the exception where the obligee acquires the claim from another person and implies a set-off situation. This exception makes the assertion of a set-off legally valid.

9. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although this case involves obligations for compensation due to loss or damage from a tort and for death or injury to person, it doesn't include any exceptions that would allow for a set-off. Thus, asserting a set-off is not legally valid.

10. (2, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive scenario includes the exception of acquiring the claim from another person, specifies a tort committed in bad faith, and involves compensation for death or injury to person. Given that it meets the criteria for an exception, asserting a set-off can be considered legally valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and yields a clear verdict based on Article 509's stipulations regarding set-offs for specific obligations.

 ### Begin Factoring
To analyze the given query in relation to Article 120(2), we first need to break down the key components and understand their implications:

1. **Voidable Acts**: The article discusses acts that are voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress.
2. **Rescission**: It mentions that such acts may be rescinded.
3. **Authority to Rescind**: Specifies that only the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or their agent or successor, can rescind the act.
4. **Grounds for Rescission**: The grounds for rescission are mistake, fraud, or duress.

Given these factors, we need to evaluate if a query logically follows from them. However, without a specific query provided in your request, we will assess a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes: "Can anyone rescind an act that was made under duress?"

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given the hypothetical query, "Can anyone rescind an act that was made under duress?" the answer would be "N" because, according to Article 120(2), only the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or their agent or successor, has the authority to rescind such an act. This indicates a specific condition (authority to rescind) is missing from the query's assumption that anyone can rescind the act, making it not logically follow from the article without specifying the correct authority.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 120(2), I will generate 10 case scenarios using the factors:

1. **Voidable Acts**
2. **Rescission**
3. **Authority to Rescind**
4. **Grounds for Rescission**

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: The act is voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress (factor 1 and factor 4), but there is no information about rescission or authority to rescind, so the act remains invalid.

2. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The act has been rescinded (factor 2) by the person with authority to do so (factor 3), making the act legally valid as it has been properly rescinded.

3. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the person with authority to rescind is present (factor 3), the act is still voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress (factor 1), and there is no indication of rescission, so the act remains invalid.

4. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: The act has been rescinded (factor 2) due to mistake, fraud, or duress (factor 4), but without the proper authority to rescind, the rescission is not valid, making the act remain invalid.

5. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: The act is voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress (factor 1) and has been rescinded (factor 2), but without information on who rescinded it, the validity of the rescission is uncertain, so the act remains invalid.

6. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: The person with authority to rescind is present (factor 3) and the grounds for rescission exist (factor 4), but there is no indication that a rescission has occurred, so the act remains invalid.

7. (1 | N) 
Justification: The act is voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress (factor 1), but without any action taken regarding rescission or authority to rescind, the act remains invalid.

8. (2 | Y) 
Justification: The act has been rescinded (factor 2), which implies that the necessary conditions for a valid rescission have been met, including proper authority and grounds, making the act legally valid as it has been properly rescinded.

9. (3 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of the person with authority to rescind (factor 3) indicates that if a rescission were to occur, it would be done by someone with the legal right to do so, potentially making any future act or obligation legally valid if all other conditions are met.

10. (4 | N) 
Justification: The existence of grounds for rescission (factor 4) such as mistake, fraud, or duress indicates that an act could be voidable, but without any action taken regarding rescission or authority to rescind, the act remains invalid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and yields a clear verdict on the legal validity of the juridical act based on Article 120(2).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Evaluate if the query entails factor 1
The query mentions "An act that is voidable on the grounds of a mistake," which directly relates to voidable acts as discussed in Article 120(2). Therefore, the query entails factor 1.

## Step 2: Evaluate if the query entails factor 2
The query talks about rescinding an act, which aligns with the concept of rescission mentioned in Article 120(2). Hence, the query entails factor 2.

## Step 3: Evaluate if the query entails factor 3
The query specifies "by the successor of the contractual status of the person who made the manifestation of intention by mistake," indicating that it acknowledges the authority to rescind is not just anyone but specifically mentions a successor. This aligns with the article's stipulation regarding who can rescind such acts. Thus, the query entails factor 3.

## Step 4: Evaluate if the query entails factor 4
The query explicitly mentions "on the grounds of a mistake," which is one of the grounds for rescission listed in Article 120(2). Therefore, the query entails factor 4.

## Step 5: Determine the validity of the query based on Article 120(2)
Given that the query accurately reflects the conditions under which an act can be rescinded (by a successor of the person who made the defective manifestation and on grounds such as mistake), it aligns with the legal principles outlined in Article 120(2). The query does not explicitly state that the juridical acts or obligations are legally invalid but rather outlines a condition under which they could be rescinded, implying a recognition of their initial validity under certain conditions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1), (Query entails 2), (Query entails 3), (Query entails 4), (Query Valid)}$

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement with respect to Article 153, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Postponement or Renewal of Prescription Period**: The article discusses the postponement of the expiry of prescription periods or the renewal of such periods under specific provisions (Articles 147, 148, 149 through 151).
2. **Effectiveness Between Parties**: It states that any postponement or renewal is effective only between the parties for whom the grounds to postpone or renew have arisen.
3. **Successors Included**: The effectiveness also extends to the successors of these parties.
4. **Specific Provisions**: Different provisions (Articles 147, 148, and Articles 149 through 151) have different applications regarding the postponement of prescription periods.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given that we are asked to determine if a query logically follows from Article 153 without the actual query provided, let's create a hypothetical query for analysis: "The postponement of the expiry of a prescription period under Article 149 is effective between all parties involved."

Analyzing this query against the factored components:
- **Postponement or Renewal of Prescription Period**: The query specifically mentions the postponement under Article 149, which aligns with factor 1.
- **Effectiveness Between Parties**: However, it suggests effectiveness "between all parties involved," which may not align with factor 2 that limits effectiveness to parties for whom grounds have arisen and their successors.
- **Successors Included**: The query does not explicitly mention successors, but this aspect (factor 3) is crucial for understanding the scope of application.
- **Specific Provisions**: The query correctly references a specific provision (Article 149), aligning with factor 4.

Given these considerations, if the query implies that the postponement under Article 149 applies universally without limiting to parties with arisen grounds and their successors, it would not logically follow from Article 153. Therefore, based on this analysis:

The final answer is: $\boxed{N}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 153, we can generate 10 unique case scenarios to assess the legal validity of obligations under different conditions. The factors are:

1. **Postponement or Renewal of Prescription Period**
2. **Effectiveness Between Parties**
3. **Successors Included**
4. **Specific Provisions**

Here are the 10 case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | Y) - In a scenario where there is a postponement or renewal of the prescription period and it is effective between the parties for whom grounds have arisen, the juridical act would be considered legally valid because it meets the primary conditions outlined in Article 153 regarding the effectiveness of such postponements or renewals.

2. (3, 4 | N) - If only successors are included and specific provisions are referenced without considering the postponement or renewal of the prescription period or its effectiveness between parties, the act would be invalid because it lacks essential elements required by Article 153 for legal validity.

3. (1, 3 | Y) - When there is a postponement or renewal of the prescription period and successors are included, the juridical act can be considered legally valid if we assume that effectiveness between parties is implicitly addressed, as including successors implies an intention to adhere to the article's requirements regarding prescription periods.

4. (2, 4 | Y) - In a case where the postponement or renewal is effective between the parties and specific provisions are referenced, the act would be legally valid because it directly aligns with Article 153's stipulations on effectiveness and the application of specific legal provisions.

5. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - If all factors regarding the postponement or renewal of the prescription period, its effectiveness between parties, and the inclusion of successors are present, the juridical act would undoubtedly be legally valid as it comprehensively meets all conditions outlined in Article 153.

6. (4 | N) - Reference to specific provisions alone, without any consideration for the postponement or renewal of the prescription period, its effectiveness between parties, or the inclusion of successors, would render the act invalid due to the lack of substantial compliance with Article 153's requirements.

7. (1, 4 | Y) - When there is a postponement or renewal of the prescription period and specific provisions are referenced, the act can be considered legally valid if we assume that the effectiveness between parties and the inclusion of successors are managed appropriately under those provisions.

8. (2, 3 | Y) - If the postponement or renewal is effective between the parties and successors are included, the juridical act would likely be legally valid because it addresses key aspects of Article 153 concerning the application and succession of prescription periods.

9. (1, 2, 4 | Y) - In a scenario where there is a postponement or renewal of the prescription period, it is effective between the parties, and specific provisions are referenced, the act would be legally valid as it directly complies with the critical stipulations of Article 153 regarding prescription periods and their legal application.

10. (3 | N) - If only successors are included without any reference to the postponement or renewal of the prescription period, its effectiveness between parties, or specific provisions, the juridical act would be invalid because it fails to meet the fundamental criteria set forth in Article 153 for determining legal validity.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the given tasks:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "The postponement of expiry of prescription period is not effective against the successors of the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period have arisen."

Assessing this query against the factors:

1. **Postponement or Renewal of Prescription Period**: The query mentions the postponement of expiry of prescription period, which aligns with factor 1.
   - (Query entails 1)

2. **Effectiveness Between Parties**: The query discusses effectiveness between parties, specifically stating it's "not effective against the successors," which seems to contradict factor 2 that includes successors.
   - (Query not entails 2)

3. **Successors Included**: The query explicitly mentions successors, aligning with factor 3 but suggests they are excluded from the effectiveness, which contradicts the original statement in Article 153.
   - (Query entails 3)

4. **Specific Provisions**: The query does not reference specific provisions like Articles 147, 148, or 149 through 151, so it doesn't directly align with factor 4.
   - (Query not entails 4)

### Task 2:
Given the query: "The postponement of expiry of prescription period is not effective against the successors of the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period have arisen."

This query explicitly expresses that certain juridical acts (or obligations, specifically the postponement of prescription periods) are not legally valid or effective in a particular context (against successors), which implies an assessment of legal validity.

- (Query Invalid)

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding Article 187 and its legal validity concerning a given sentence, we must first factor the article into its core components to understand what it implies about the rights and actions of a successor to a possessor. 

### Begin Factoring
1. **Successor's Right to Assert Possession**: The article states that a successor to a possessor has the right to assert their own possession.
2. **Option to Include Predecessor's Possession**: The successor also has the option to assert not just their own possession but that of their predecessor as well, if they choose to do so.
3. **Freedom of Choice**: The article explicitly mentions that the choice between asserting one's own possession only or including that of the predecessor is at the discretion of the successor.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 3

Given these factors, we can analyze any query regarding Article 187 by checking if it aligns with these core principles. For instance, a query stating "A successor can choose to assert their own possession or that of both themselves and their predecessor" would logically follow the article because it directly reflects the freedom of choice granted by Article 187 (factor 3) and the specific rights outlined in factors 1 and 2.

However, without a specific query provided for Article 187, we cannot determine its legal validity directly. The process involves comparing the query's claims against the factors extracted from the article to see if they align or contradict each other. If a query respects the successor's rights as outlined (factors 1 and 2) and acknowledges their freedom of choice (factor 3), it would be considered legally valid within the context provided, thus warranting a response of "Y". Conversely, any query that contradicts these principles would not logically follow from the article, leading to a response of "N".

Since no specific query was provided for Article 187, I will provide an example analysis based on a hypothetical query: 

- Hypothetical Query: "A successor must always assert both their own possession and that of their predecessor."
  
This query does not logically follow from the article because it contradicts factor 3 (Freedom of Choice) by removing the option for the successor to choose how they wish to assert possession. Thus, the response would be "N" due to the absence of a mandatory requirement to always include the predecessor's possession in the assertion, which directly opposes the successor's freedom of choice as stated in Article 187.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 187, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each with a subset of these factors. For each scenario, I'll provide a justification determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1 | Y)
Justification: The successor's right to assert their own possession (factor 1) is a fundamental aspect of Article 187. If this factor occurs, it means the successor is exercising their basic right, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: When both the option to include the predecessor's possession (factor 2) and the freedom of choice (factor 3) are present, the successor has the flexibility to decide how they want to assert possession. This combination respects the spirit of Article 187, making the act legally valid.

3. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The presence of both the successor's right to assert their own possession (factor 1) and the option to include the predecessor's possession (factor 2) ensures that the successor has the necessary rights and options as per Article 187, making the act legally valid.

4. (3 | N)
Justification: If only the freedom of choice (factor 3) is present without any reference to the successor's right to assert their own or the predecessor's possession, it does not provide enough context to determine the legality of the act based on Article 187 alone. However, since factor 3 is about the freedom to choose and does not inherently contradict the article, this justification might seem counterintuitive. A more precise interpretation would consider the absence of specific rights (factors 1 and 2) as crucial for determining validity, thus potentially leading to a determination of invalidity due to lack of specific context.

5. (2 | N)
Justification: The option to include the predecessor's possession (factor 2) without the successor's right to assert their own possession (factor 1) or the freedom of choice (factor 3) could imply an obligation rather than an option, which contradicts the principle of freedom of choice as understood in the context of Article 187. Thus, this scenario might not align perfectly with the article's intent.

6. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The combination of the successor's right to assert their own possession (factor 1) and the freedom of choice (factor 3) ensures that the successor can exercise their rights as intended by Article 187, making the juridical act legally valid.

7. (2 | Y)
Revisiting the justification for factor 2 alone: Upon further consideration, if the option to include the predecessor's possession is present, it implies that the successor has a choice that aligns with Article 187's intent, even without explicitly mentioning factors 1 and 3. This could be seen as legally valid in the context of exercising options provided by the article.

8. (1 | N)
Revisiting factor 1 alone with a different perspective: While the successor's right to assert their own possession is fundamental, without any reference to the option of including the predecessor's possession or the freedom of choice, it might not fully capture the nuances of Article 187, potentially leading to questions about its validity in isolation.

9. (3, 2 | Y)
Justification: This combination has already been addressed in scenario 2, but to reiterate, when both the freedom of choice and the option to include the predecessor's possession are present, it aligns with Article 187, making the act legally valid.

10. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The presence of all factors—successor's right to assert their own possession, option to include predecessor's possession, and freedom of choice—fully respects the provisions of Article 187, ensuring that the successor's rights and options are recognized and protected, thus making the juridical act legally valid.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors from Article 187, allowing for an analysis of their legal validity based on the article's provisions.
Starting Ollama server on port 11435 with GPU 1...
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 ### Begin Factoring
1. The article discusses a claim that one co-owner has against other co-owners regarding property in co-ownership.
2. This claim can be exercised against the specific successors of the other co-owners.
3. The context implies that the rights and obligations related to the co-owned property are transferable to successors.
4. The query's validity hinges on whether the article supports the concept of claims being transferred or exercisable against successors in the context of co-ownership.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given the factored elements, we can analyze the query's validity. The article explicitly states that a claim one co-owner has against others "may be exercised against their specific successors." This directly supports the notion that claims related to co-owned property can indeed be transferred or exercised against the successors of the original co-owners.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the factoring of the article's key points, the query logically follows the legal context outlined in Article 254 A. 

The response is: Y
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 254 A, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: Even with just the first factor present, which discusses a claim one co-owner has against other co-owners regarding property in co-ownership, it's reasonable to infer that such a claim could be legally valid as it falls under the purview of co-ownership disputes.

2. (2 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of the second factor alone, which states that this claim can be exercised against the specific successors of the other co-owners, directly implies legal validity because it outlines a clear procedure for transferring obligations.

3. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: With both factors 1 and 2 present, we have a complete scenario where a claim exists among co-owners and can be exercised against their successors, clearly supporting the legality of such actions under Article 254 A.

4. (3 | N) 
Justification: If only the third factor is considered, which mentions that the context implies rights and obligations related to the co-owned property are transferable to successors, without direct reference to claims or their exercise, it's ambiguous and does not directly support legal validity on its own.

5. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The fourth factor alone discusses the query's validity in relation to Article 254 A supporting the concept of claims being transferred or exercisable against successors. Since this directly pertains to the article's subject matter, it supports legal validity.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Combining factors 1 and 3, we have a scenario where a claim among co-owners exists and there's an implication of transferable rights and obligations. This combination provides a basis for legally valid actions under the principles of co-ownership.

7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: With factors 2 and 4 present, the exercise of claims against successors and the article's support for such concepts are both acknowledged, leading to a clear indication of legal validity.

8. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Factors 1 and 4 together establish that there is a claim among co-owners and that Article 254 A supports the idea of exercising claims against successors, making the juridical act legally valid.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although factors 3 and 4 discuss the transferability of rights and obligations and the article's support for claims against successors, without explicit mention of a claim or its exercise (factor 1 or 2), the scenario lacks direct evidence of legal validity regarding a specific claim.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: With all factors present, we have a comprehensive scenario that includes the existence of a claim among co-owners, the ability to exercise this claim against successors, the implication of transferable rights and obligations, and the article's support for these concepts. This combination unequivocally supports legal validity.

Each case has been carefully constructed to ensure no two cases use the same combination of factors, providing a range of scenarios that test different aspects of Article 254 A's implications on co-ownership claims and their exercise against successors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, we must first factor the relevant information into key points and then assess whether these points support or contradict the query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Right to Choose**: The right to choose among more than one performance belongs to the obligor (Article 406).
2. **Exercise of Choice**: This right is exercised by manifesting an intention to the counterparty (Article 407(1)).
3. **Irrevocability of Choice**: Once manifested, the intention may not be withdrawn without the consent of the counterparty (Article 407(2)).
4. **Subject Matter Determination**: The subject matter of a claim can depend on this choice among multiple performances.
### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given that no specific query is provided to assess against these factors, let's consider how one might approach determining the validity of a hypothetical query:

- If a query suggests that the obligee (the party to whom the performance is owed) has the right to choose among performances without any conditions or exceptions stated in the article, it would not logically follow from the given articles because **Factor 1** clearly states the right belongs to the obligor.
  
- A query stating that an obligor can change their mind after manifesting their intention without needing consent would contradict **Factor 3**, making it invalid.

- If a query aligns with the process of choosing among performances as outlined (e.g., stating the obligor makes the choice by manifesting intention to the counterparty), it would logically follow from the given articles because it respects **Factors 1** and **2**.

Therefore, without a specific query to evaluate, we can only outline how one would approach determining validity based on the factors extracted from the legal article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors extracted from the article:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The right to choose among more than one performance belongs to the obligor, which is a fundamental principle established by Article 406. Therefore, if only this factor is present, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: Without the context of who has the right to choose (Factor 1), simply exercising the choice by manifesting an intention does not provide enough information to determine legal validity. It could be an unauthorized party making the choice.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: Knowing that a manifested intention may not be withdrawn without consent (Irrevocability of Choice) doesn't inherently validate a juridical act without knowing who made the choice or how it was exercised.

4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: When both the right to choose belongs to the obligor and this right is exercised by manifesting an intention to the counterparty, these factors together support the legal validity of the juridical act, as they follow the process outlined in Articles 406 and 407(1).

5. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Even though the choice is exercised and there's an understanding about the irrevocability of the choice, without knowing who has the right to make this choice (Factor 1), we cannot confirm the legal validity of the act.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: If the obligor has the right to choose and understands that once a choice is made it cannot be withdrawn without consent, these factors suggest a legally valid process because they respect both the allocation of the right to choose and the consequences of exercising that right.

7. (4 | N) 
Justification: The subject matter of a claim depending on a choice among multiple performances doesn't inherently make a juridical act valid or invalid without information on how the choice is made or by whom.

8. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Knowing that the obligor has the right to choose and that the subject matter of the claim depends on this choice provides a basis for legal validity because it establishes both the authority for the decision and its relevance to the claim.

9. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: While exercising the choice and the dependency of the claim's subject matter on this choice are important, without clarity on who has the right to make this choice, the act's validity cannot be confirmed.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When all factors are present—meaning the obligor has the right to choose, exercises this right by manifesting an intention, understands that the choice is irrevocable without consent, and the subject matter of the claim depends on this choice—the juridical act is clearly legally valid because it fulfills all conditions and processes outlined in Articles 406 and 407.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factors
To determine whether the query entails each factor, we must analyze the query in relation to the factors extracted from the legal articles.

- The query discusses the manifestation of intention by the obligor and its irrevocability without consent.
- Factor 1 relates to the right to choose belonging to the obligor, which is not directly addressed by the query's focus on manifestation and withdrawal.
- Factor 2 concerns the exercise of choice through manifesting intention, which aligns with the query's discussion on manifestation.
- Factor 3 addresses the irrevocability of the manifested intention without consent, directly relating to the query's statement about not withdrawing the manifestation without consent.
- Factor 4 deals with the subject matter determination based on the choice among performances, which is not explicitly addressed by the query.

## Step 2: Determining Entailment for Each Factor
Based on the analysis:
- The query does not directly entail Factor 1 because it doesn't specifically state that the right to choose belongs to the obligor; it assumes this context.
- The query entails Factor 2 since it talks about manifesting an intention, which is how the choice is exercised according to Article 407(1).
- The query entails Factor 3 as it explicitly mentions that the manifestation may not be withdrawn without consent, aligning with Article 407(2).
- The query does not directly entail Factor 4 because it doesn't discuss how the subject matter of a claim is determined by the choice among performances.

## Step 3: Evaluating Query Validity
To assess whether the query is valid or invalid according to the provided legal articles:
- The query states that the manifestation of intention may not be withdrawn without the consent of the obligee, which aligns with Article 407(2).
- This means the query accurately reflects a principle from the given legal articles regarding the irrevocability of the obligor's choice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 2)}$ 
The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 3)}$ 
The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

 To address the given problem, let's first break down the provided article into its core components or factors to understand its structure and implications better.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Cancellation Right**: The article mentions that one of the parties has the right to cancel pursuant to the provisions of the contract or the law.
2. **Manifestation of Intention**: Cancellation is effected by a manifestation of intention to the other party, implying a clear communication or notification is required.
3. **Irrevocability of Manifestation**: The manifestation of intention once made cannot be revoked, indicating finality in the decision to cancel.
4. **Contractual or Legal Basis**: The right to cancel is grounded in either the provisions of the contract or the law, suggesting that such actions are legally recognized and governed.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Given this factoring, we can analyze any query to determine its legal validity within the context provided by Article 540. However, since a specific query is not provided for validation against Article 540, let's create a hypothetical query for illustration purposes: "Can a party revoke their manifestation of intention to cancel after it has been communicated to the other party?"

Based on the factors identified:
- The article clearly states that the manifestation of intention may not be revoked (Factor 3: Irrevocability of Manifestation).
- This directly addresses the hypothetical query, indicating that revocation of a cancellation intention is not permissible under the given legal context.

Therefore, for the hypothetical query "Can a party revoke their manifestation of intention to cancel after it has been communicated to the other party?", the answer would be "N" because it contradicts the irrevocability principle stated in the article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors identified from Article 540:

1. **Cancellation Right**
2. **Manifestation of Intention**
3. **Irrevocability of Manifestation**
4. **Contractual or Legal Basis**

Here are ten case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors and providing a justification for whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N):

1. (1 | N) 
Justification: The presence of only the "Cancellation Right" factor does not inherently make the juridical act valid since it lacks manifestation of intention, which is crucial for effecting cancellation.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: Having only "Manifestation of Intention" without considering if there's a right to cancel or if it's based on contractual or legal grounds makes the act potentially invalid due to lack of basis for cancellation.

3. (3 | N) 
Justification: The factor of "Irrevocability of Manifestation" alone does not validate an action since it doesn't address whether there was a legitimate right to cancel in the first place.

4. (4 | Y) 
Justification: If the cancellation is grounded in either contractual or legal provisions, this provides a solid basis for the act's validity, assuming all other necessary conditions are met implicitly.

5. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Although "Cancellation Right" and "Manifestation of Intention" are present, without considering if the manifestation can be revoked or if it's based on contractual/legal grounds, the act remains uncertain in terms of finality and legitimacy.

6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of having a "Cancellation Right" and the intention being "Irrevocable" suggests a clear and final decision to cancel, which aligns with principles of legal certainty and finality.

7. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: While there's a "Manifestation of Intention" and it's based on "Contractual or Legal Basis", the absence of a specified right to cancel and the irrevocability of the manifestation leaves ambiguity regarding the act's validity.

8. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of both "Irrevocability of Manifestation" and "Contractual or Legal Basis" provides a strong foundation for the juridical act's validity, ensuring that once the intention to cancel is manifested, it's final and legally grounded.

9. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Having a clear "Cancellation Right" based on "Contractual or Legal Basis" directly supports the legality of the cancellation, assuming other conditions like manifestation of intention are implicitly fulfilled.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario includes all factors: there's a right to cancel, this right is manifested clearly to the other party, the manifestation is irrevocable, and it's all grounded in contractual or legal provisions. This comprehensive fulfillment of conditions strongly supports the juridical act's validity.

======= Query Entaiments:
 For Task 1:

Given the query "The manifestation of intention to cancel may not be revoked," we can assess its relation to the factors listed.

- The query directly references the concept of a manifestation of intention, which aligns with Factor 2: Manifestation of Intention. However, it more specifically addresses the revocation aspect of this manifestation.
- The query explicitly mentions that the manifestation of intention "may not be revoked," which directly corresponds to Factor 3: Irrevocability of Manifestation.

Therefore, the output for Task 1 should acknowledge that the query entails Factor 3.

(Query entails 3)


For Task 2:

The query "The manifestation of intention to cancel may not be revoked" is essentially stating a rule or principle derived from Article 540, specifically highlighting the irrevocability aspect. This statement does not question or challenge the legal validity of the juridical acts (or obligations) themselves but rather affirms a specific characteristic of how cancellations are handled according to the article.

Given this context, the query is affirming a principle that aligns with what would be considered legally valid behavior under Article 540. It's stating a condition or rule without questioning its validity, which suggests that it implicitly accepts the legal framework provided by the article.

Therefore, for Task 2, the output should reflect that the query does not express invalidity but rather aligns with or states a principle of legal validity as per the given context.

4. **Rescission Against Third Parties**: The rescission of a manifestation of intention due to fraud cannot be asserted against a third party who acted in good faith and without negligence.
5. **Good Faith and Negligence**: The article emphasizes the importance of good faith and the absence of negligence on the part of third parties.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we have factored the article into its key components, to determine if a query is legally valid with the context of this article, we would need to examine how each factor relates to the query. However, since no specific query was provided for evaluation against Article 96, I will outline a general approach:

- If a query involves manifestations of intention affected by fraud or duress and considers the roles of all parties involved (including third-party fraud and the conditions under which a manifestation can be considered voidable), it would likely be valid (Y) if it aligns with these factors.
- If a query ignores critical aspects such as the knowledge of the second party in cases of third-party fraud, or neglects the protection afforded to third parties acting in good faith without negligence, it might not logically follow from the article and could be considered invalid (N).

Without a specific query to evaluate against Article 96, it's essential to apply this general framework: matching the query's elements against the factors outlined above to assess its validity within the context of the provided legal article.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors outlined from Article 96, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention was made under duress, which is a form of coercion that can invalidate consent. According to factor 2, such a manifestation is voidable due to duress, but since the query does not specify any third-party involvement or good faith considerations, we focus solely on the impact of duress, making the act legally valid for voidability purposes.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: A third party committed fraud inducing a first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party, but there's no mention that the second party knew or could have known about the fraud. Without this knowledge, according to factor 3, the manifestation cannot be considered voidable solely on the basis of third-party fraud without considering the second party's awareness.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention was made under duress and later rescinded due to the discovery of the coercion. Factor 4 indicates that such a rescission cannot be asserted against a third party acting in good faith without negligence. Since we're focusing on the validity of the initial act being voidable, it's considered legally valid for purposes of evaluating its initial enforceability.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention was based on fraud, making it voidable under factor 2. Additionally, a third party acted in good faith and without negligence, which aligns with factor 5. The combination suggests that while the act itself might be voidable due to fraud, the third party's actions do not negate the initial assessment of voidability.

5. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention was affected by a third-party fraud. However, without evidence that the second party knew or could have known about this fraud (factor 3), we cannot conclusively determine the manifestation's voidability based solely on these factors.

6. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention was made under fraud, and a third party was involved in committing this fraud. The second party was aware or should have been aware of the fraud, making the manifestation voidable according to factor 3. This aligns with factor 2's stipulation on voidability due to fraud.

7. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A rescission of a manifestation of intention due to fraud is considered against a third party who acted in good faith and without negligence. According to factor 4, such a rescission cannot be duly asserted against this third party, implying that the initial act's validity or voidability is preserved from being challenged by an innocent third party.

8. (1, 2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention was based on both fraud and duress, making it clearly voidable under factor 2. Additionally, considering a third party acted in good faith without negligence (factor 5), this does not negate the initial act's voidability but rather protects the innocent third party from rescission.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: A third-party fraud led to a manifestation of intention, and there was an attempt to rescind this manifestation against another third party who acted in good faith without negligence. According to factor 4, such a rescission is not valid against the innocent third party, suggesting that the act's initial validity or the ability to void it due to third-party fraud (factor 3) does not directly apply when considering protections for good-faith actors.

10. (1, 2, 3, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive scenario involves a manifestation of intention based on both fraud and duress (factor 1), making it voidable due to these coercive factors (factor 2). A third party's involvement in the fraud is known to the second party (factor 3), solidifying the basis for considering the manifestation voidable. Finally, with a third party acting in good faith without negligence (factor 5), while this protects them from rescission attempts, it does not undermine the initial assessment of voidability due to the presence of fraud and duress. Thus, the act is considered legally valid for purposes of evaluating its enforceability and potential voidability.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given query, let's first factor the provided legal articles into key points to understand their context and implications better.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Manifestation of Intention**: A manifestation of intention can be voidable if it is based on fraud or duress (Article 96(1)).
2. **Third Party Fraud**: If a third party commits fraud that induces a first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party, the manifestation is voidable only if the second party knew or could have known about the fraud (Article 96(2)).
3. **Rescission Against Third Parties**: The rescission of a manifestation of intention due to fraud cannot be asserted against a third party who acted in good faith without negligence (Article 96(3)).
4. **Liability for Damage**: A person is liable to compensate for damage if they have intentionally or negligently infringed on the rights or legally protected interests of another person (Article 709).
5. **Good Faith and Negligence**: The concept of acting in good faith and without negligence is crucial, especially when considering the rights of third parties.
6. **Voidable Manifestations**: Manifestations of intention that are voidable due to fraud or duress can be rescinded under certain conditions.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 6>

Given these factors, we need a query to assess its legal validity within the context provided by Article 96 and Article 709. Since no specific query is provided for validation against these articles, let's create a hypothetical query based on the information given:

Query: "If someone makes a contract under duress, can they later claim compensation for damages from the other party if that party was unaware of the duress?"

To determine if this query is legally valid within the context of the provided articles:

- The query touches on the concept of a manifestation of intention being voidable due to duress (Article 96(1)), which aligns with factor 1.
- It implies a situation where one party might be seeking compensation for damages, which relates to Article 709 and factors 4 and 6.
- However, the query's validity hinges on whether the other party's unawareness of the duress affects their liability for damages, which involves considerations of good faith and negligence (factor 5).

Given these points, the query seems to logically follow from the legal context provided, as it deals with voidable manifestations of intention due to duress and the potential for seeking compensation for damages. Thus, based on the factors extracted and the hypothetical query:

Answer: Y

Reasoning: The query directly relates to the concepts outlined in Article 96 regarding voidable manifestations of intention and Article 709 concerning liability for damage. It explores a scenario that is plausible within the framework established by these articles, particularly focusing on the implications of duress on contractual agreements and the pursuit of damages.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 96 and Article 709, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario will combine different factors to determine whether a juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention based on fraud (factor 1) can lead to liability for damage under Article 709 (factor 4), making the juridical act legally valid in terms of pursuing compensation.

2. (2, 5 | N)
Justification: If a third party commits fraud inducing a first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party who is unaware of the fraud (factor 2), and considering the concept of good faith and negligence (factor 5), the act might not be directly invalid due to the second party's lack of knowledge, but the presence of fraud complicates direct validity.

3. (3, 6 | Y)
Justification: The rescission of a manifestation of intention due to fraud cannot be asserted against a third party in good faith without negligence (factor 3), and since manifestations of intention that are voidable due to fraud or duress can be rescinded under certain conditions (factor 6), this scenario allows for legal validity in terms of contractual obligations.

4. (1, 2 | N)
Justification: A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress (factor 1) combined with a third party committing fraud that induces the first party to make such a manifestation (factor 2) could render the act invalid due to the deceitful nature of the agreement.

5. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: Liability for damage resulting from intentional or negligent infringement on rights (factor 4) and the concept of acting in good faith without negligence (factor 5) together imply that a juridical act aiming to compensate for damages while adhering to principles of good faith could be legally valid.

6. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress (factor 1) and the consideration that rescission due to fraud cannot be asserted against a third party acting in good faith without negligence (factor 3) suggest that, under specific conditions, such acts could still have legal validity, especially concerning third-party rights.

7. (2, 6 | N)
Justification: If a third party's fraud induces a manifestation of intention (factor 2), and considering that manifestations can be voidable due to fraud or duress (factor 6), the combination leans towards the act being invalid because it is based on deceitful actions.

8. (4, 6 | Y)
Justification: Liability for damage under Article 709 (factor 4) combined with the concept of voidable manifestations due to fraud or duress (factor 6) indicates that seeking compensation for damages in such scenarios can be legally valid, as it aligns with legal principles of liability and contractual integrity.

9. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress (factor 1) considered alongside the principle of acting in good faith without negligence (factor 5) suggests that while the act itself may be voidable, parties acting in good faith can still pursue legal remedies, indicating a level of legal validity.

10. (3, 5 | Y)
Justification: The protection of third parties acting in good faith without negligence from rescission due to fraud (factor 3) combined with the emphasis on good faith and non-negligence (factor 5) implies that juridical acts respecting these principles are legally valid, as they prioritize fairness and integrity in legal transactions.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict based on the provided articles.

 To address the given tasks based on the provided query and factors:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "In cases where the person who makes the manifestation believes a fictitious explanation of the counterparty and makes a manifestation of intention, if there was no intention of fraud for the counterparty, the person who makes the manifestation will not be rescued under Civil Code."

Let's assess each factor in relation to this query:

1. **Manifestation of Intention**: The query involves a manifestation of intention based on a fictitious explanation, which aligns with the concept of voidable manifestations due to fraud or duress.
   - (Query entails 1)

2. **Third Party Fraud**: The query does not explicitly mention a third party committing fraud but discusses a scenario where one party believes a fictitious explanation provided by the counterparty.
   - (Query not entails 2)

3. **Rescission Against Third Parties**: The query mentions that the person who makes the manifestation will not be rescued, implying a discussion on rescission, but it does not directly involve asserting rescission against a third party.
   - (Query not entails 3)

4. **Liability for Damage**: The query does not explicitly discuss liability for damage or compensation.
   - (Query not entails 4)

5. **Good Faith and Negligence**: The query implies that the counterparty had no intention of fraud, suggesting an element of good faith.
   - (Query entails 5)

6. **Voidable Manifestations**: The scenario involves a manifestation of intention that could be considered voidable due to being based on a fictitious explanation.
   - (Query entails 6)

### Task 2:
Given the query's context, it seems to imply that under certain conditions (no intention of fraud by the counterparty), the person who made the manifestation cannot claim rescission or invalidation of their action. This suggests that the juridical act (the manifestation of intention) is considered legally valid in such a scenario.

- (Query Valid)

This assessment is based on the provided query and factors, maintaining a skeptical perspective as instructed.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 5

Given these factors, we can analyze queries to determine if they logically follow from the article's context. However, without a specific query provided in your prompt, I'll outline how one might approach evaluating a query against this article:

- **Legally Valid (Y)**: A query would be considered legally valid if it directly aligns with or logically follows from these factors. For example, "A manifestation of intention made under duress is voidable" would be a direct application of factor 2 and thus valid.
  
- **Not Legally Valid (N)**: Conversely, a query that contradicts these factors or introduces elements not covered by them might not be considered legally valid. For instance, if a query implies that all manifestations of intention are always voidable regardless of the circumstances, it would contradict factor 2 and the specific conditions under which a manifestation can be voided.

Without a specific query to evaluate against the article's factors, I've outlined a general approach based on the provided legal context.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 96, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of these factors occurred and provides a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention (factor 1) made under fraudulent conditions (factor 2) directly falls under the article's provision that such manifestations are voidable due to fraud. Therefore, this scenario is considered legally valid as it aligns with the provisions for voidability.

2. (3 | N)
Justification: If only a third party's involvement in fraud (factor 3) without any mention of the second party's knowledge or awareness of the fraud is considered, the manifestation of intention cannot be deemed voidable solely on this basis without considering the second party's state of mind or actions.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention (factor 1) that is subject to rescission against a third party (factor 4) falls under the article's provision regarding the limitations on rescinding manifestations of intention induced by fraud against third parties in good faith. This scenario is legally valid as it involves considerations directly addressed by the article.

4. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention that is voidable due to fraud or duress (factor 2) and involves considerations of good faith and negligence (factor 5) directly aligns with the article's provisions regarding voidability and the importance of parties' states of mind and actions. This scenario is legally valid.

5. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention (factor 1) influenced by a third party's fraud (factor 3) can be considered voidable if the second party knew or could have known about the fraud. This scenario directly relates to the article's conditions for voidability and is thus legally valid.

6. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The rescission of a manifestation of intention against a third party (factor 4) who acted in good faith without negligence (factor 5) is directly addressed by the article as not being duly asserted. This scenario is legally valid because it aligns with the provisions for protecting third parties acting in good faith.

7. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention that is voidable due to fraud or duress (factor 2) and involves a third party's fraud (factor 3) falls under the article's conditions for voidability, especially if the second party was aware or should have been aware of the fraud. This scenario is legally valid.

8. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention (factor 1) made with considerations of good faith and negligence (factor 5) can impact its validity, particularly in how parties' states of mind and actions are evaluated under the article's provisions. This scenario is legally valid as it involves factors directly addressed by the article.

9. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: If a third party commits fraud (factor 3) but the manifestation of intention cannot be rescinded against a third party in good faith without negligence (factor 4), this does not inherently make the manifestation voidable without considering the second party's knowledge or awareness of the fraud. This scenario might not directly lead to a voidable manifestation without additional factors.

10. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention that is voidable due to fraud or duress (factor 2) and is subject to rescission against a third party (factor 4) aligns with the article's provisions regarding both voidability and the limitations on rescinding such manifestations against third parties acting in good faith. This scenario is legally valid as it directly involves conditions outlined in the article.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors, ensuring no two cases are identical, and provides a clear justification for whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N) based on the occurrences of these factors within the context of Article 96.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factors
The query discusses a scenario where a person enters into a contract based on fraud by another party. It states that the person who made the manifestation (based on the fraud) cannot refuse to execute their obligation unless the manifestation of intention is rescinded. This involves understanding manifestations of intention, voidability due to fraud, and the conditions under which obligations can be refused or executed.

## Step 2: Evaluating Entailment of Each Factor
1. **Manifestation of Intention**: The query directly mentions a "manifestation of intention," indicating it entails factor 1.
2. **Voidable Due to Fraud or Duress**: The query implies the manifestation is based on fraud, aligning with factor 2.
3. **Third-Party Involvement in Fraud**: While not explicitly mentioning a third party, the focus is on fraud by "the other person," suggesting involvement of another party in the fraud, which could imply factor 3, but it's less direct since it doesn't specify if this other person is a second or third party to the manifestation.
4. **Rescission Against Third Parties**: The query talks about rescinding the manifestation of intention, which aligns with factor 4, though it doesn't explicitly mention third parties in good faith without negligence.
5. **Good Faith and Negligence**: The query does not directly address good faith or negligence on the part of any party involved.

## Step 3: Conclusion on Factor Entailment
Based on the assessment:
- (Query entails 1)
- (Query entails 2)
- (Query not entails 3) because it doesn't explicitly involve a third party in the fraud in the context provided by factor 3.
- (Query entails 4) since it discusses rescission of the manifestation, even though it does not specify conditions about third parties.
- (Query not entails 5) as there's no mention of acting in good faith or negligence.

## Step 4: Evaluating Query Validity
The query suggests that until a manifestation of intention is rescinded due to fraud, the obligations based on that manifestation must be executed. This implies that despite the fraud, the juridical act (or obligation) remains legally valid unless and until it is formally rescinded.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Valid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to Article 96, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Manifestation of Intention**: The article discusses manifestations of intention that are based on fraud or duress.
2. **Voidability**: Such manifestations are considered voidable, meaning they can be declared invalid under certain conditions.
3. **Third Party Fraud**: If a third party commits fraud that leads to a manifestation of intention between two other parties, the manifestation is voidable only if the second party knew or could have known about the fraud.
4. **Rescission and Good Faith**: The rescission (or cancellation) of a manifestation due to fraud cannot be used against a third party who acted in good faith without negligence.
5. **Knowledge and Negligence**: The article implies that knowledge of the fraud or lack of negligence is crucial for determining the validity of a manifestation of intention and its potential rescission.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Now, to determine if a query logically follows from Article 96, we must consider how these factors apply. Without a specific query provided in your question, I'll demonstrate how to approach this with a hypothetical query:

Query: "If a person signs a contract due to fraud by a third party, can they cancel the contract even if the other party to the contract was unaware of the fraud and acted in good faith?"

Given the factors outlined:
- The manifestation of intention (signing the contract) is based on fraud.
- It's voidable, but the conditions under which it can be voided depend on the knowledge or potential knowledge of the second party about the fraud.
- If the second party was unaware and acted in good faith, the rescission might not affect them due to their lack of negligence.

Therefore, if we were to answer "Y" or "N" based on this hypothetical query:
- **Y** would be correct because the article directly addresses situations where manifestations of intention are voidable due to fraud, including scenarios involving third-party fraud and the implications for rescission against parties acting in good faith.

This approach ensures that each factor of the article is considered in relation to the query's validity.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors outlined from Article 96, here are 10 case scenarios with justifications for each:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation of intention based on fraud is voidable, and if a third party commits fraud inducing this manifestation, it's still considered voidable under certain conditions, making the juridical act legally valid initially but subject to potential invalidation.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: If a third party commits fraud and the second party knew or could have known about it, the manifestation of intention is voidable. Given that knowledge of the fraud is present, the act can be considered invalid due to the direct involvement of fraudulent activity and awareness thereof.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: A manifestation based on fraud is voidable, but if rescinded, it may not affect a third party in good faith without negligence. This implies that while the initial act is subject to being declared invalid due to fraud, its legal validity can be maintained against certain parties.

4. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: If the manifestation of intention is based on fraud by a third party and the second party could have known about it, then the lack of negligence or knowledge does not protect the act from being considered invalid due to its voidable nature under these conditions.

5. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: When a third party's fraud induces a manifestation of intention and this is rescinded, if done against a party acting in good faith without negligence, the act remains legally valid for that party. This maintains the legal validity despite the fraud.

6. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: A manifestation based on fraud is voidable, and if there's knowledge of the fraud or lack of negligence, this supports declaring the act invalid due to its fraudulent basis and the awareness or potential awareness of the parties involved.

7. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: If a third party commits fraud leading to a manifestation of intention, and the rescission of this act doesn't affect a third party in good faith without negligence, then the initial act can still be considered legally valid for those not directly implicated in the fraud.

8. (3, 1 | N) 
Justification: When a third party's fraud leads to a manifestation of intention based on that fraud, the act is inherently voidable due to its fraudulent nature, making it potentially invalid without further considerations.

9. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The rescission of an act due to fraud cannot be asserted against a third party acting in good faith without negligence, indicating that despite potential issues with knowledge or lack thereof, the act can remain legally valid for parties not directly involved in the fraudulent activity.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | N) 
Justification: If all factors are present—meaning there's a manifestation of intention based on fraud, it's voidable due to third-party fraud, the second party knew or could have known about the fraud, the rescission affects a third party in good faith without negligence, and there are considerations of knowledge and negligence—then the complexity and direct involvement of fraudulent activity likely render the juridical act invalid due to its foundation on deceit and the awareness of the parties involved.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1 - Manifestation of Intention
The query discusses a situation where a buyer deceives a seller, leading to the transfer of ownership of land. This involves a manifestation of intention (the seller's decision to transfer ownership) based on fraud.

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2 - Voidability
The query implies that the seller's manifestation of intention is voidable due to the fraud committed by the buyer.

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3 - Third Party Fraud
The situation involves a third party (the buyer) committing fraud, which leads to the manifestation of intention between the seller and the buyer. However, it also mentions someone accepting the establishment of a mortgage without knowing of the fraud, which introduces another party into the scenario.

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4 - Rescission and Good Faith
The query mentions that even if someone has accepted the establishment of a mortgage without knowing of the fraud (acting in good faith), the seller can still revoke the manifestation of intention. This touches on the concept of rescission and good faith.

## Step 5: Assessing Factor 5 - Knowledge and Negligence
The scenario implies that the buyer's knowledge (of committing fraud) and the lack of knowledge by the third party (the one accepting the mortgage establishment) are crucial. However, it does not directly address negligence.

## Step 6: Determining Query Validity
Given the query's details, we must assess whether the juridical act (the seller revoking the manifestation of intention due to fraud) is legally valid or invalid according to Article 96. The article suggests that manifestations based on fraud are voidable and that rescission against a third party in good faith might not be duly asserted. However, the query specifically states that despite someone acting in good faith (accepting the mortgage establishment without knowing of the fraud), the seller can revoke the manifestation of intention.

## Step 7: Conclusion
Based on Article 96, manifestations of intention based on fraud are voidable. The query involves such a scenario and suggests that the seller can revoke their manifestation of intention due to fraud, even when a third party is involved who acted in good faith without knowledge of the fraud.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1), (Query entails 2), (Query entails 3), (Query entails 4), (Query entails 5), (Query Invalid)}$

 To evaluate the query's validity, we first need to factor the given article into its key components and then assess how these factors interact with the query provided.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Effective Time of Manifestation**: A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party.
2. **Prevention of Notice**: If the other party prevents notice without a legitimate reason, it's deemed to have reached them at the normal time.
3. **Post-Notice Capacity Changes**: The effect of a manifestation is not impaired by changes in the sender's capacity (death, loss of mental capacity, legal restrictions) after sending the notice.
4. **Legitimate Reason for Prevention**: The concept of a "legitimate reason" for preventing notice, which could affect whether prevention is deemed valid or not.
5. **Normal Receipt Time**: The notion of when notice would "normally" reach the other party, serving as a baseline for effectiveness in cases of prevention.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given that we have factored the article into its core components, we can now address the task of determining whether a query is legally valid within the context provided. However, since no specific query was provided to evaluate against these factors, I will demonstrate how one might approach this task with a hypothetical query.

**Hypothetical Query**: If a person sends a notice of intention to buy a property but dies before the notice reaches the seller, is the manifestation of intention still effective?

To answer this, we refer back to our factored components:
- **Effective Time of Manifestation** (Factor 1) indicates that effectiveness is tied to when the notice reaches the other party.
- **Post-Notice Capacity Changes** (Factor 3) explicitly states that changes in the sender's capacity after sending the notice do not impair its effect.

Given these factors, we can conclude that the hypothetical query would be valid (Y), as the article directly addresses and supports the scenario where a manifestation of intention remains effective despite changes in the sender's capacity post-sending.

For an actual query to be evaluated, please provide it, and I will assess its validity against the factored components of Article 97.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 97, I will generate 10 case scenarios as instructed.


1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party. Since Factor 1 is present and it directly addresses the effectiveness of the manifestation, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (2 | N) 
Justification: If the other party prevents notice without a legitimate reason, it's deemed to have reached them at the normal time. However, since only Factor 2 is considered here without any mention of a legitimate reason or the impact of prevention on the effectiveness, we cannot conclusively determine validity based solely on this factor. Yet, for simplicity and adherence to the instruction format, we'll consider this as leading to an invalidation due to the potential for dispute over what constitutes "legitimate reason" and its implications.

3. (3 | Y) 
Justification: The effect of a manifestation is not impaired by changes in the sender's capacity after sending the notice. This factor directly supports the validity of the juridical act regardless of post-sending capacity changes, making it legally valid.

4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Combining Factors 1 and 2, even if the other party prevents notice without a legitimate reason, the manifestation is still considered effective at the time it would have normally reached them. Thus, the juridical act remains legally valid.

5. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: With both the effective time of manifestation (Factor 1) and post-notice capacity changes (Factor 3) considered, the manifestation's effectiveness is secured both at the time of receipt and despite any subsequent capacity changes. This combination reinforces the juridical act's legal validity.

6. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: If prevention occurs without a legitimate reason and considering post-notice capacity changes do not affect the manifestation, then the notice is deemed effective at its normal receipt time. The sender's capacity changes after sending also do not impair the effect. Thus, the juridical act remains valid.

7. (4 | N) 
Justification: The concept of a "legitimate reason" for preventing notice could introduce ambiguity or conditions under which the prevention is justified, potentially affecting the validity of the manifestation. Without clear criteria for what constitutes a legitimate reason, this factor alone might lead to disputes over the juridical act's validity, hence considered invalid in isolation.

8. (5 | Y) 
Justification: The notion of "normal receipt time" serves as a baseline for determining when a notice is deemed to have reached the other party, especially in cases of prevention without legitimate reason. This factor supports the principle that manifestations are effective at the point they would normally be received, implying legal validity under standard conditions.

9. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Combining the effective time of manifestation with the consideration of a legitimate reason for prevention, if such a reason exists, it could affect when or if the notice is deemed received. However, since Factor 1 establishes effectiveness at receipt and assuming a legitimate reason does not negate the intent but merely delays or conditions its acceptance, the juridical act can still be considered valid.

10. (2, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This combination addresses prevention without a legitimate reason, the concept of a legitimate reason itself, and the normal receipt time. Even with these complexities, since the notice is deemed to have reached the other party at its normal time if prevented without a legitimate reason, and given that we consider the presence of a legitimate reason as part of the scenario, the juridical act's effectiveness can still be determined based on when it would normally reach the recipient. Thus, it remains legally valid under the conditions outlined by these factors.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 97 to assess the legal validity of a juridical act or obligations based on the occurrence of specific factors related to manifestations of intention and their effectiveness.

 To determine whether a given query is legally valid within the context of Article 20, let's first break down the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Legal Capacity**: The article discusses individuals with "qualified legal capacity" and those with the "legal capacity to act," indicating different levels of legal competence.
2. **Dealings and Representation**: It mentions dealings between parties, including scenarios where one party has a legal representative, curator, or assistant due to their legal capacity status.
3. **Ratification and Rescission**: The article outlines procedures for ratifying or rescinding acts, including time frames for responses and the implications of failing to respond within those time frames.
4. **Notification and Time Frames**: Specific time frames (e.g., one month or longer) are given for parties to respond regarding the ratification of acts, and there are consequences for not responding within these periods.
5. **Curatorship and Assistance**: The article addresses scenarios involving persons under curatorship or assistance, requiring them to seek ratification from their curator or assistant for certain acts.
6. **Implied Ratification or Rescission**: It introduces the concept of implied ratification (if a person fails to respond within the specified time frame) and implied rescission (if special formalities are not completed or if notice of getting a curator/assistant's ratification is not sent).
### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 6>

Without a specific query provided to assess against Article 20, we cannot directly determine legal validity. However, the process involves comparing the query against these factored components to see if it aligns with the principles outlined in Article 20 regarding legal capacity, dealings, ratification/rescission procedures, notification time frames, curatorship/assistance, and implications of actions or inactions within specified time frames.

To assess a query's validity, one would need to:
- Identify which factors from Article 20 are relevant to the query.
- Determine if the query logically follows from the principles outlined in those factors.
- Consider any potential gaps or omissions in the query that might not align with the legal context provided by Article 20.

Given the requirement for a specific query to evaluate, the explanation above outlines the methodological approach to determining legal validity within the context of Article 20.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors from Article 20, here are 10 case scenarios:

1. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: A person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act and is demanded by the other party to ratify an act within a specified time frame. Since they have the legal capacity to act and are aware of the demand, their failure to respond within the time frame implies ratification, making the juridical act legally valid.

2. (2, 4 | N)
Justification: A person under curatorship is involved in dealings, but the other party fails to lodge a demand with the curator regarding an act that requires ratification. Since the proper procedure for dealing with a person under curatorship was not followed, the juridical act is invalid.

3. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: A person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act, and before this change, the other party had lodged a demand with their legal representative regarding an act that requires ratification. The person's failure to respond after gaining full legal capacity implies ratification, making the juridical act legally valid.

4. (3, 5 | N)
Justification: A person fails to complete special formalities required for an act and also does not notify the other party of getting their curator's ratification within the specified time frame. The failure to meet both conditions (special formalities and notification) renders the juridical act invalid.

5. (4, 6 | Y)
Justification: A person under assistance is demanded by the other party to get their assistant's ratification for an act within a fixed period. If they fail to send notice of getting this ratification within the time frame, it implies rescission. However, since the demand was properly made and the implications of not responding were clear, the initial agreement to the terms (before implied rescission) makes the juridical act legally valid initially.

6. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: A person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act and is involved in dealings that require ratification by their curator or assistant due to previous restrictions. Their failure to respond to a demand regarding ratification implies ratification of the act, making it legally valid.

7. (2, 3 | N)
Justification: The other party lodges a demand with the legal representative of a person with qualified legal capacity but fails to specify the need for special formalities to be completed within a certain time frame. Without clear instructions on all necessary steps (including special formalities), the juridical act cannot be deemed legally valid.

8. (4, 1 | Y)
Justification: A demand is made to a person under curatorship to get their curator's ratification for an act, and after they gain full legal capacity to act, they are demanded again to ratify the act personally within a specified time frame. Their failure to respond implies ratification, making the juridical act legally valid.

9. (5, 6 | N)
Justification: A person under curatorship or assistance fails to send notice of completing special formalities and also does not notify the other party of getting their curator's or assistant's ratification within the specified time frame. The failure on both accounts (special formalities and notification of ratification) implies rescission, making the juridical act invalid.

10. (3, 2 | Y)
Justification: A person with qualified legal capacity is involved in dealings where the other party demands ratification of an act within a specified time frame, and before gaining full legal capacity, their legal representative was notified of the need for special formalities to be completed. The person's subsequent failure to respond after gaining full capacity implies ratification, making the juridical act legally valid.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 20 and determines the legal validity of the juridical act based on those factors.

4. **Notice and Receipt**: Notice must be received for a manifestation to be effective, implying an action is required from the recipient to acknowledge or respond to the manifestation.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given this factoring, we need to assess whether the query logically follows from these factors. However, since no specific query is provided for Article 97, let's create a hypothetical query based on common legal questions related to manifestations of intention and then evaluate its validity against the article.

**Hypothetical Query**: If a person sends a manifestation of intention but dies before the other party receives it, is the manifestation still effective?

To determine if this query is legally valid with the context of Article 97:

- **Factor 1 (Manifestation of Intention Effectiveness)** supports that the manifestation becomes effective upon receipt.
- **Factor 3 (Post-Notice Capacity Changes)** explicitly states that changes in the sender's capacity after sending do not impair the effectiveness, which directly addresses our hypothetical query.

Given these factors, especially Factor 3, it is clear that the article does indeed support the notion that a manifestation of intention remains effective even if the sender dies after sending but before the recipient receives the notice. Thus, the hypothetical query logically follows from the legal context provided by Article 97.


The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors derived from Article 97, we'll consider different combinations of these factors. The factors are:

1. **Manifestation of Intention Effectiveness**
2. **Prevention of Notice**
3. **Post-Notice Capacity Changes**
4. **Notice and Receipt**
5. **Legitimate Reasons for Prevention**

Here are the case scenarios:

1. (1, 4 | Y) - This scenario involves a manifestation of intention becoming effective upon receipt (Factor 1) and notice being received by the other party (Factor 4). Since both conditions necessary for a manifestation to be effective are met, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (2, 5 | N) - In this case, one party prevents notice without a legitimate reason (Factor 2), and the concept of legitimate reasons for prevention (Factor 5) comes into play. However, since there's no legitimate reason for preventing the notice, and Factor 5 doesn't directly address the validity in such scenarios but rather implies consequences for unjustified prevention, we lean towards this being invalid due to the lack of a legitimate reason.

3. (3 | Y) - This scenario only involves changes in the sender's capacity after sending the notice (Factor 3). According to Article 97, such changes do not impair the effectiveness of the manifestation, so the juridical act remains legally valid.

4. (1, 2 | N) - Here, a manifestation of intention is sent (Factor 1), but the other party prevents its receipt without a legitimate reason (Factor 2). Although Factor 2 suggests the notice could be deemed received at the normal time, the absence of any factor confirming actual or deemed receipt (like Factor 4) in this scenario complicates direct application. However, since prevention without a legitimate reason could imply an attempt to avoid legal obligation, we might lean towards invalidity due to potential bad faith.

5. (4, 5 | Y) - In this case, notice is received by the other party (Factor 4), and there are considerations regarding legitimate reasons for preventing notice (Factor 5). Since notice was successfully received, and Factor 5 supports the notion of legitimacy in communication, the juridical act can be considered legally valid.

6. (1, 3 | Y) - This scenario involves a manifestation of intention becoming effective upon receipt (Factor 1) and changes in the sender's capacity after sending the notice (Factor 3). Given that Factor 3 explicitly states such changes do not impair effectiveness, and assuming receipt occurs, the juridical act is legally valid.

7. (2, 3 | Y) - Here, one party prevents notice without a legitimate reason (Factor 2), but there are also changes in the sender's capacity after sending (Factor 3). Although Factor 2 introduces complexity due to unjustified prevention, since the notice would be deemed received at the normal time and changes in capacity post-sending do not affect validity (Factor 3), we could argue for legal validity.

8. (1, 5 | Y) - This case involves a manifestation of intention becoming effective upon receipt (Factor 1) and considerations regarding legitimate reasons for preventing notice (Factor 5). Assuming the notice is received without prevention or with legitimate reason, the juridical act is legally valid.

9. (4, 3 | Y) - In this scenario, notice is received by the other party (Factor 4), and there are changes in the sender's capacity after sending the notice (Factor 3). Since receipt has occurred, and post-sending capacity changes do not affect validity, the juridical act remains legally valid.

10. (2, 4 | Y) - Here, one party prevents notice without a legitimate reason (Factor 2), but the notice is still received by the other party (Factor 4). Given that the notice would be deemed received at the normal time despite prevention and actual receipt has occurred, we can consider the juridical act legally valid.

Each case considers unique combinations of factors to assess the legal validity of a juridical act based on Article 97.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the given query regarding the legal validity of a statement with respect to Article 97, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors apply to the query at hand.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Manifestation of Intention Effectiveness**: A manifestation of intention becomes effective when notice of it reaches the other party.
2. **Prevention of Notice**: If one party prevents notice without a legitimate reason, the notice is considered received at the time it normally would have been.
3. **Post-Notice Capacity Changes**: The effectiveness of a manifestation of intention is not affected by changes in the sender's capacity (death, loss of mental capacity, or legal restrictions) after the notice has been sent.
4. **Notice Receipt**: The actual receipt of notice by the other party is crucial for the manifestation to be effective.
5. **Legitimate Reason for Prevention**: The prevention of notice must be without a legitimate reason to deem the notice as received at the normal time.

### End of Factoring

Given these factors, we can analyze the query: "If someone sends a notice but dies before it is delivered, is the manifestation of intention still effective?"

- **Factor 3 (Post-Notice Capacity Changes)** directly addresses this scenario, stating that changes in capacity after sending the notice do not impair its effectiveness.
- The other factors support the context in which manifestations of intention are considered effective but do not directly impact the outcome of this specific query.

Therefore, based on Article 97 and specifically factor 3, the manifestation of intention remains effective even if the sender dies after sending the notice but before it is delivered. This means the query logically follows the legal context provided by Article 97.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 97, I will generate 10 case scenarios with different combinations of factors. Here they are:


1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The manifestation of intention becomes effective when notice reaches the other party, so if factor 1 occurs, the juridical act is legally valid.


2. (2 | N) 
Justification: If one party prevents notice without a legitimate reason, but we're not considering whether it would have been received at the normal time or any capacity changes, then alone this factor suggests an attempt to thwart the process, potentially rendering the act invalid.


3. (3 | Y) 
Justification: Changes in the sender's capacity after sending the notice do not impair its effectiveness, making the juridical act legally valid.


4. (1, 2 | N) 
Justification: Although the manifestation of intention becomes effective when notice reaches the other party (factor 1), if one party prevents this notice without a legitimate reason (factor 2), it introduces uncertainty about the intent to receive or acknowledge the notice, potentially invalidating the act.


5. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The actual receipt of notice by the other party is crucial for the manifestation to be effective. If factor 4 occurs, indicating successful receipt, then the juridical act can be considered legally valid.


6. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Combining factors 1 and 3 means that even if changes occur in the sender's capacity after sending (factor 3), as long as notice reaches the other party (factor 1), the manifestation of intention remains effective.


7. (2, 5 | N) 
Justification: If one party prevents notice without a legitimate reason (factor 2) and there was no legitimate reason for this prevention (factor 5), it suggests an intentional obstruction, which could invalidate the juridical act.


8. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Even if changes in capacity occur after sending the notice (factor 3), and the notice is successfully received by the other party (factor 4), the manifestation of intention remains effective.


9. (1, 2, 5 | N) 
Justification: Combining factors where one party prevents notice without a legitimate reason (factor 2), there's an emphasis on the lack of a legitimate reason for this prevention (factor 5), and normally, effectiveness relies on reaching the other party (factor 1). However, the intentional prevention without a valid reason may override the potential validity based on receipt.


10. (2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Despite one party preventing notice (factor 2), if we consider that changes in capacity do not affect the manifestation's effectiveness after it's sent (factor 3) and that the notice would have been received under normal circumstances (implied by factor 4), then the juridical act can still be considered legally valid, as the prevention and subsequent capacity changes do not inherently invalidate the original intent.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the given tasks regarding the legal validity of a statement with respect to Article 97 and the provided query, let's break down the information:

### Factors from Article 97:
1. **Manifestation of Intention Effectiveness**: A manifestation of intention becomes effective when notice of it reaches the other party.
2. **Prevention of Notice**: If one party prevents notice without a legitimate reason, the notice is considered received at the time it normally would have been.
3. **Post-Notice Capacity Changes**: The effectiveness of a manifestation of intention is not affected by changes in the sender's capacity (death, loss of mental capacity, or legal restrictions) after the notice has been sent.
4. **Notice Receipt**: The actual receipt of notice by the other party is crucial for the manifestation to be effective.
5. **Legitimate Reason for Prevention**: The prevention of notice must be without a legitimate reason to deem the notice as received at the normal time.

### Query Analysis:
The query states, "Even if it is a contract offer with a determined consent period, if the period is before or at the same time as the arrival of the offer, it can be revoked."

- **Task 1**: The query seems to touch on the idea of when a manifestation of intention (in this case, a contract offer) becomes effective and whether it can be revoked. Specifically, it relates to **Factor 1 (Manifestation of Intention Effectiveness)** because it discusses the timing of the offer's arrival in relation to its revocation. Therefore, the output for Task 1 should acknowledge that the query entails discussions about when a manifestation of intention becomes effective and potentially about its revocation before or at the time of receipt.

- **Task 2**: The query explicitly mentions that under certain conditions (the consent period being before or at the same time as the offer's arrival), the contract offer "can be revoked." This implies that the juridical act (or obligation) in question is considered legally valid to be revoked, which reflects on the legal validity of the actions taken within the context provided.

### Task Outputs:
- **Task 1 Output**: (Query entails 1)
- **Task 2 Output**: (Query Valid)

These outputs reflect that the query discusses aspects related to when a manifestation of intention becomes effective and implies that certain juridical acts (in this case, revoking an offer under specific conditions) are legally valid.

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement based on the provided articles (Article 113 and Article 115), we first need to factor these articles into their key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Contract Conclusion by UnAuthorized Agent**: A contract concluded by someone acting as an agent without authority does not bind the principal.
2. **Ratification Requirement**: The principal must ratify the contract for it to be binding.
3. **Notification of Ratification**: Ratification or refusal to ratify must be communicated to the counterparty to be duly asserted, unless the counterparty already knows about it.
4. **Right to Rescind**: A counterparty has the right to rescind a contract concluded by an unauthorized agent until the principal ratifies it.
5. **Knowledge of Lack of Authority**: The right to rescind does not apply if the counterparty knew at the time of the contract that the agent lacked authority.
6. **Binding Nature Post-Ratification**: Once ratified, the contract becomes binding on the principal.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 6>

Given these factors, we need a query to evaluate its legal validity based on Article 113 and Article 115. Since no specific query is provided for evaluation, let's create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes:

Query: "A contract made by an agent without authority can be rescinded by the counterparty before the principal has a chance to ratify it, regardless of whether the counterparty knew about the lack of authority."

Evaluating this query against the factored articles:
- The query touches on factors 1, 2, 4, and 5. 
- It correctly identifies that a contract by an unauthorized agent can be rescinded (factor 4) but incorrectly suggests this can happen regardless of the counterparty's knowledge about the lack of authority (contradicting factor 5).

Therefore, based on the analysis, the query would not logically follow the legal context provided because it misinterprets or overlooks a crucial condition regarding the counterparty's knowledge.

Answer: N

This response is based on analyzing the factors present in the articles and comparing them with the elements of the hypothetical query. The discrepancy between the query's assertions and the conditions outlined in the articles, specifically regarding the counterparty's knowledge of the agent's lack of authority, leads to the conclusion that the query does not logically follow the legal context provided.
======== Generate Examples:
 Here are 10 case scenarios based on the factors from Article 113 and Article 115:


1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The contract was concluded by an unauthorized agent (factor 1), but the principal ratified it (factor 2), making the contract legally valid.


2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the counterparty has the right to rescind the contract (factor 4), the ratification or refusal to ratify was not communicated to them (factor 3), rendering the attempt to assert this right invalid in this context.


3. (5 | N) 
Justification: The counterparty knew at the time of the contract that the agent lacked authority (factor 5), which means they cannot rescind the contract based on lack of authority, making their claim invalid.


4. (1, 6 | Y) 
Justification: A contract was concluded by an unauthorized agent (factor 1), but once ratified (implied by factor 6, which mentions the binding nature post-ratification), it becomes legally valid.


5. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The principal's ratification (factor 2) and its communication to the counterparty (factor 3) ensure that the contract is legally valid, as both necessary conditions for validity are met.


6. (4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: Although the counterparty has the right to rescind the contract until it's ratified (factor 4), if the principal ratifies it (implied by factor 6), the contract becomes binding and thus legally valid.


7. (1, 5 | N) 
Justification: The contract was made by an unauthorized agent (factor 1), and the counterparty knew about the lack of authority at the time of the contract (factor 5), which means they cannot rescind based on this ground, but it doesn't validate the initial unauthorized act.


8. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The principal's ratification (factor 2) is crucial; before this happens, the counterparty has the right to rescind (factor 4), but once ratified, the contract becomes legally valid.


9. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The knowledge of the counterparty about the agent's lack of authority (factor 5) and the requirement for notification of ratification or refusal (factor 3) indicate specific conditions under which a contract might not be considered legally valid due to procedural issues.


10. (1, 2, 6 | Y) 
Justification: This scenario combines all elements necessary for a contract to be legally valid: it was concluded by an unauthorized agent (factor 1), the principal ratified it (factor 2), and once ratified, it becomes binding on the principal (factor 6), ensuring its legal validity.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks based on the provided query and factors:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "Even in cases where the principal ratifies an act of unauthorized agency toward an unauthorized agent, if the counterparty does not know of this fact, he or she can exercise the right to rescind."

Assessing the presence of factors:
- The query entails **3** because it discusses the scenario where the counterparty's knowledge (or lack thereof) about the ratification affects their ability to act.
- The query entails **4** since it mentions the counterparty's right to rescind, which is directly related to factor 4.
- The query entails **5** as it specifies conditions under which the right to rescind can be exercised, including the counterparty's knowledge of the agent's lack of authority.

### Task 2:
Evaluating the validity of the query based on the provided articles (Article 113 and Article 115):
The query suggests that even after ratification by the principal, if the counterparty is unaware of this ratification, they can still rescind the contract. This aligns with the principles outlined in the articles, especially considering the importance of notification and knowledge in the legal validity of contracts and actions taken by unauthorized agents.

Given this analysis, the query seems to accurately reflect the legal context provided by Article 113 and Article 115 regarding the rights of counterparties in situations involving unauthorized agency and ratification. Therefore, the query is considered valid based on the information provided.

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a statement with respect to Article 114, we first need to factor the given article into its key components. Then, we will analyze these factors in relation to the query to determine if it logically follows from the context provided by the article.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Principal's Action**: The principal has the authority to ratify or refuse a proposal made by a counterparty.
2. **Counterparty's Request**: The counterparty can demand a definitive answer from the principal within a specified reasonable period.
3. **Timeframe for Response**: A reasonable period of time is given for the principal to respond.
4. **Default Action**: If the principal fails to give a definite answer within the specified period, it is deemed as refusal to ratify.
5. **Ratification Implication**: Ratification implies acceptance of the proposal by the principal.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given the factored components and without a specific query provided to test against Article 114, I will create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes: "If the counterparty does not receive a response within the specified timeframe, can they assume the proposal is rejected?"

Analyzing this query against the factored components:
- **Principal's Action** and **Default Action** together imply that the principal's inaction leads to a deemed refusal.
- **Counterparty's Request** for a definitive answer sets the stage for the expectation of a response within a specified timeframe.

Considering these factors, the query logically follows from the context provided by Article 114 because it directly relates to the consequences of the principal's failure to respond within the given timeframe. Therefore, based on this hypothetical query, the response would be "Y" (Yes), as it aligns with the implications of the article regarding the default action in case of no response from the principal.

However, without a specific query provided in your question, this analysis is based on a hypothetical scenario designed to illustrate how one might approach determining legal validity with respect to Article 114.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 114, I will generate 10 case scenarios using the factored components. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The principal has the authority to ratify or refuse a proposal, and the counterparty requests a definitive answer. Since both factors related to the principal's action and the counterparty's request are present, the juridical act is legally valid.

2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: A reasonable period of time is given for the principal to respond, but if they fail to give a definite answer within that period, it is deemed as refusal to ratify. The absence of the principal's action and the counterparty's request implies that the juridical act may not be legally binding.

3. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The principal has the authority to ratify or refuse a proposal, and ratification implies acceptance of the proposal by the principal. Since both factors related to the principal's action and its implications are present, the juridical act is legally valid.

4. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The counterparty requests a definitive answer from the principal within a specified reasonable period. Given that both factors related to the counterparty's request and the timeframe for response are present, the juridical act can be considered legally valid.

5. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: Although the principal has the authority to ratify or refuse a proposal, the default action of deemed refusal due to lack of response may not necessarily imply legal validity without considering the counterparty's request and timeframe for response.

6. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The counterparty requests a definitive answer from the principal, and ratification implies acceptance of the proposal by the principal. Since both factors related to the counterparty's request and its implications are present, the juridical act is legally valid.

7. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: A reasonable period of time is given for the principal to respond, but without the principal's action or the counterparty's request, ratification cannot be implied as a default action, rendering the juridical act potentially invalid.

8. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The principal has the authority to ratify or refuse a proposal, the counterparty requests a definitive answer within a specified reasonable period, and all necessary components for a legally valid agreement are present.

9. (4, 5 | N) 
Justification: If the principal fails to give a definite answer within the specified period, it is deemed as refusal to ratify. However, without considering the counterparty's request or the principal's initial action, this factor alone may not establish legal validity regarding ratification implications.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: All factors are present: the principal's authority to ratify, the counterparty's request for a definitive answer within a reasonable period, and the default action of deemed refusal due to lack of response. Given this comprehensive set of factors, the juridical act can be considered legally valid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors, ensuring that no two cases use the same subset of factors from Article 114. The verdict for each case is determinate, providing either a "Yes" (Y) or "No" (N) answer regarding legal validity based on the presence and implications of the factors involved.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1
The query discusses the counterparty's ability to demand ratification from the principal within a specified period and the implications of the principal's response or lack thereof. This involves the principal's action, as it pertains to ratifying or not ratifying the act of unauthorized agency.

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2
The query mentions the counterparty demanding to ratify or not to ratify during a specified period, which directly relates to the counterparty's request for a definitive answer from the principal.

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3
The query specifies that the counterparty determines a reasonable period of time for the principal to respond, which aligns with the factor regarding a timeframe for response.

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4
However, the query incorrectly states that if the principal does not provide a definite answer within the time period, the principal is deemed to have ratified. According to Article 114, the correct interpretation should be that the principal is deemed to have refused to ratify, not ratified.

## Step 5: Assessing Factor 5
The query's focus on ratification implies acceptance of the proposal by the principal but does so inaccurately in terms of the default action following a lack of response from the principal.

## Step 6: Evaluating Query Validity
Given that the query misinterprets the default action (deemed refusal to ratify instead of deemed ratification), it does not accurately reflect the legal implications as outlined in Article 114. Therefore, the query is invalid regarding the legal validity of the statement with respect to Article 114.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1)(Query entails 2)(Query entails 3)(Query not entails 4)(Query entails 5)(Query Invalid)}$

 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, let's break down the process into steps that involve factoring the key points from the article and then analyzing these factors in relation to the query.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Definition of Subagent**: A subagent is someone who acts on behalf of an agent (who themselves represent a principal) within the scope of their authority.
2. **Scope of Authority**: The actions of a subagent are limited to what they have been authorized to do by the original agent or principal.
3. **Rights and Obligations**: A subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent, but these are confined to the scope of their specific authority.
4. **Representation**: A subagent represents the principal in dealings with third parties, but only within their authorized scope.
5. **Agency Relationship**: The relationship between a principal, an agent, and a subagent is hierarchical, with each level having its own set of responsibilities and authorities.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, to assess the validity of a query regarding Article 106, we would need to compare them against the specifics of the query. However, since no specific query was provided for Article 106, let's create a hypothetical query and evaluate its validity based on the factored elements:

Hypothetical Query: "A subagent can enter into contracts with third parties that exceed their scope of authority without needing further approval from the principal or agent."

Evaluating this query against the factors:
- **Definition of Subagent** and **Scope of Authority** (factors 1 and 2) imply that a subagent's actions are limited.
- **Rights and Obligations** (factor 3) suggest that while a subagent has rights and obligations, these are within their authorized scope.
- **Representation** (factor 4) indicates the subagent represents the principal but within their authority.

Given these considerations, the query seems to contradict factors 2 and 3 because it implies acting outside of one's authorized scope without additional approval, which is not supported by the article. Therefore, based on the provided article and the hypothetical query:

Answer: N

The query does not logically follow from the legal context provided in Article 106, primarily because it suggests actions beyond the defined scope of authority without addressing how such actions would be legitimized or approved by the principal or agent.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 106, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: If a subagent acts within their defined scope of authority as outlined by the agent or principal (factor 2), and represents the principal in dealings with third parties (factor 1), then their actions are legally valid.

2. (3, 5 | Y)
Justification: A subagent having the same rights and obligations as an agent (factor 3) within the hierarchical agency relationship (factor 5) means that their juridical acts are recognized and thus legally valid.

3. (1, 4 | N)
Justification: Even though a subagent represents the principal (factor 1) and has a role in representation (factor 4), without specific authorization or scope of authority, their actions could be considered invalid if they act beyond what is explicitly allowed.

4. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: When a subagent's actions are limited to their scope of authority (factor 2) and they have the same rights and obligations as an agent (factor 3), it implies that their actions within this scope are legally valid.

5. (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This combination covers the definition of a subagent, their scope of authority, and their rights and obligations. Given all these factors are met, the subagent's actions would be considered legally valid.

6. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: Although representation by the subagent (factor 4) within an agency relationship (factor 5) is crucial, without explicit mention of scope or authority, it cannot be determined as legally valid on its own.

7. (2, 4 | Y)
Justification: If a subagent's actions are within their authorized scope (factor 2) and they represent the principal in dealings with third parties (factor 4), then their juridical acts are considered legally valid.

8. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: Having the same rights and obligations as an agent (factor 3) and representing the principal (factor 4) does not automatically make a subagent's actions valid without consideration of their scope of authority.

9. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: In the context of an agency relationship (factor 5), if a subagent acts on behalf of the agent who represents the principal (factor 1), and this action is within the understood parameters of their role, then it can be considered legally valid.

10. (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: A subagent acting within their scope of authority (factor 2) within a hierarchical agency relationship (factor 5) implies that their actions are controlled and thus likely to be legally valid, as they adhere to the established boundaries of their authority.

1. The article discusses acts performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent of another person.
2. Such acts may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity.
3. There is an exception for acts performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity.
4. The query needs to be evaluated against these rules to determine its validity.

Given the query is missing, let's create a generic query to evaluate: "An act performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent can be rescinded due to the principal's lack of qualified legal capacity."

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 4>

Based on the factored elements, the query seems to contradict the main rule stated in the article (factor 2), which suggests that acts performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity. However, without the specific query provided in the problem statement, we must infer based on typical scenarios related to agency and legal capacity.

If we consider a scenario where the act is performed by someone with qualified legal capacity but the principal lacks it, the article does not directly address this situation for agents (only for legal representatives of another person with qualified legal capacity). Thus, without more specific information in the query about the relationship or the nature of the act beyond "qualified legal capacity," we cannot conclusively determine its validity against the provided article.

However, given the generic interpretation and based on the factors directly mentioned in the article, if a query were to challenge the rescission based solely on qualified legal capacity for an agent's actions (without invoking the exception), it would not align with the article's main premise. Therefore, without the exact wording of the query but understanding the need to apply skepticism and consider all potential interpretations:

The final answer is: $\boxed{N}$
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The act is performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent of another person, and such acts may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: This case involves an act performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity. According to the exception in the article, this act can be rescinded, making it invalid.

3. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the act is performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent, the presence of factor 3 indicates that the agent is also a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity, triggering the exception and potentially rendering the act invalid.

4. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The query needs to be evaluated against the rules, but since the act may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity (factor 2), it is considered valid in this context.

5. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The act is performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent of another person, and given that the query needs to be evaluated against these rules, there's no indication that this would inherently invalidate the act.

6. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: This combination directly contradicts the main rule because if an act is performed by someone with qualified legal capacity as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity (factor 3), it can be rescinded despite factor 2 suggesting otherwise for agents.

7. (1 | Y) 
Justification: The mere fact that an act is performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent does not inherently invalidate the act without considering other factors.

8. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The query needs to be evaluated against these rules, but this factor alone does not provide sufficient grounds to deem the act invalid.

9. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: This case involves an exception where the person acts as a legal representative of another with qualified legal capacity, and since the query's evaluation is required, it might highlight conditions under which such an act could be deemed invalid due to specific circumstances not directly covered by factor 2.

10. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although factors 1 and 2 suggest validity for acts performed by agents with qualified legal capacity, the presence of factor 3 introduces an exception that can lead to the act being rescinded if it's about a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity, potentially overriding the general rule.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict based on the article and its exceptions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To evaluate the query's validity in relation to Article 123, we need to break down both the article and the query into their constituent factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Article Context**: The article discusses voidable acts, specifically how their voidance or ratification is affected by the identification of a counterparty.
2. **Counterparty Identification**: The act being voidable implies there's an issue with its validity that can be addressed through either voiding (making it null) or ratifying (approving it despite initial flaws).
3. **Voidance or Ratification Process**: This involves a manifestation of intention, which suggests a deliberate and communicative action towards the counterparty.
4. **Manifestation of Intention**: The method by which one party communicates their decision regarding the voidable act to the other party involved.
5. **Query Context**: The query is about determining whether the action described aligns with the legal process outlined in Article 123, focusing on communication with a counterparty.

Given these factors and without a specific query provided for evaluation against Article 123, we can infer that any query assessing the validity of voiding or ratifying a voidable act based on communication with an identified counterparty would need to consider all these aspects.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Since no specific query was given to directly apply these factors against Article 123, we must acknowledge that any assessment of legal validity would depend on how closely the query aligns with the requirements for voiding or ratifying a voidable act as outlined in the article. Without the actual query details, it's not possible to definitively answer "Y" or "N". However, based on the structure provided and assuming a hypothetical query that directly relates to the process of voiding or ratifying a voidable act with an identified counterparty, if such a query follows the intention manifestation process as described, it would logically follow the article's context.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 123, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The article context and counterparty identification are present, indicating a clear understanding of the voidable act's nature and the parties involved. This suggests that any subsequent actions regarding voidance or ratification would be legally valid as they align with the basic requirements for handling such acts.

2. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: The presence of the voidance or ratification process and query context without clear identification of a counterparty or manifestation of intention may lead to confusion about whether the act is indeed voidable and how it should be handled. Without these crucial elements, the juridical act's validity cannot be definitively established.

3. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Counterparty identification coupled with a clear manifestation of intention directly addresses the core issue of communicating decisions about a voidable act to the involved parties. This direct communication ensures that both parties are aware of the act's status and any actions taken regarding its validity, supporting the legal validity of such actions.

4. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: While the article context provides a framework for understanding voidable acts, and the voidance or ratification process outlines how to address these acts, without the identification of a counterparty or a manifestation of intention, there's insufficient information to determine the legal validity of any actions taken. The lack of direct communication with involved parties compromises the act's legitimacy.

5. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: A clear manifestation of intention and consideration of the query context imply that the decision-making process regarding the voidable act is thoughtful and communicative. Even without explicit mention of counterparty identification or the article's context, the presence of a deliberate communication attempt suggests an effort to adhere to legal processes, supporting the validity of the act.

6. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: This combination covers the foundational aspects of Article 123: understanding voidable acts (article context), identifying the counterparty, and following the voidance or ratification process. With these elements in place, any actions regarding the voidable act are well-grounded in legal procedure, indicating their validity.

7. (2, 3, 5 | N) 
Justification: Although this combination includes crucial elements like counterparty identification, the voidance or ratification process, and consideration of the query context, it lacks a clear manifestation of intention. Without explicit communication of decisions regarding the act's validity, there's uncertainty about whether legal requirements for handling voidable acts are fully met.

8. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The presence of the article context and a manifestation of intention suggests that there is both an understanding of how to handle voidable acts and a deliberate effort to communicate decisions regarding these acts. This combination supports the legal validity of actions taken because it ensures that both the process and communication aspects are addressed.

9. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The voidance or ratification process and manifestation of intention directly relate to how decisions about voidable acts are made and communicated. Even without explicit counterparty identification or reference to the article's context, these factors imply a structured approach to handling the act, supporting its legal validity.

10. (1, 2, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This comprehensive combination covers all critical aspects of Article 123: understanding voidable acts, identifying the counterparty, following a defined process for voidance or ratification, and considering the query context with a clear manifestation of intention. With all these elements in place, any actions regarding the voidable act would be thoroughly grounded in legal principles, clearly indicating their validity.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a given query logically follows from Article 123, we first need to factor the article into its key components and then analyze how these factors relate to the query in question.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Voidable Act**: The act in question is voidable, meaning it can be declared invalid under certain conditions.
2. **Counterparty Identification**: For the voidance or ratification of a voidable act to take effect, the counterparty (the other party involved in the act) must be identified.
3. **Manifestation of Intention**: The decision to void or ratify the act is made through a manifestation of intention.
4. **Notification to Counterparty**: This manifestation of intention must be communicated to the counterparty for the voidance or ratification to be effective.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 4>

Given the query "If the counterparty to a voidable act is identified, does the law require notification of the decision to void or ratify the act to this counterparty?", we analyze it against the factored components:

- The query directly references a **voidable act** and the requirement for the **counterparty to be identified**, aligning with factors 1 and 2.
- It implies the need for a **manifestation of intention** (factor 3) regarding whether to void or ratify the act, as this is the core decision being referred to.
- Finally, it specifies that this decision must be communicated to the counterparty (factor 4), which directly aligns with Article 123's stipulation.

Given that all factors necessary for the query to logically follow from Article 123 are present and correctly represented in the context of voidable acts and their resolution, the response to whether the query is legally valid within this context would be "Y". The query accurately reflects the requirements outlined in Article 123 regarding the handling of voidable acts when the counterparty is known.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors derived from Article 123, we will systematically combine these factors in various ways to assess their impact on the legal validity of a juridical act. The factors are:

1. **Voidable Act**
2. **Counterparty Identification**
3. **Manifestation of Intention**
4. **Notification to Counterparty**

Let's proceed with creating the case scenarios:

1. (1, 2 | N) - A voidable act is identified, and the counterparty is known, but without a manifestation of intention or notification to the counterparty, the act remains in limbo, thus invalid.

2. (3, 4 | N) - There's a manifestation of intention to void or ratify the act, and this decision is notified to the counterparty, but if the act itself isn't identified as voidable or the counterparty isn't properly identified, the notification lacks context, rendering it invalid.

3. (1, 3 | N) - Knowing an act is voidable and having a manifestation of intention regarding its validity doesn't suffice without identifying the counterparty or notifying them of this decision, making the act's status unresolved and thus invalid.

4. (2, 4 | N) - Identifying the counterparty and notifying them of a decision is meaningless without knowing if the act in question is voidable or having made a manifestation of intention regarding its validity, leading to an invalid scenario.

5. (1, 4 | N) - If an act is known to be voidable but there's no clear manifestation of intention or identification of the counterparty, merely notifying someone of a decision lacks both context and legal basis, rendering it invalid.

6. (2, 3 | N) - Identifying the counterparty and making a manifestation of intention are crucial steps, but without the act being clearly voidable or notification of this decision to the counterparty, the process is incomplete, leading to an invalid outcome.

7. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - With a clear identification of a voidable act, knowledge of the counterparty, and a manifestation of intention regarding its validity, the key elements for a legally valid decision are present, even without notification, as the basis for a decision is established.

8. (1, 2, 4 | Y) - Knowing an act is voidable, identifying the counterparty, and notifying them of the decision covers essential aspects of handling such acts, implying a manifestation of intention has occurred, thus making it legally valid.

9. (2, 3, 4 | Y) - When the counterparty is identified, there's a clear manifestation of intention, and this intention is communicated to the counterparty, the act's voidable nature can be inferred from the context, leading to a legally valid scenario as all necessary steps for resolution are taken.

10. (1, 3, 4 | Y) - If an act is known to be voidable, there's a manifestation of intention regarding its validity, and this decision is notified to the identified counterparty, all critical elements are in place for a legally valid outcome, despite not explicitly stating counterparty identification as a separate factor here, it's implied through notification.

Each scenario systematically explores different combinations of factors from Article 123, ensuring that no two cases use the same combination of factors and providing a clear justification for whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address both tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
Given the query: "If a person promises in a contract that he or she will tender a certain performance to a third party other than the counterparty, in cases where this is rescinded due to fraud of the counterparty, if manifestation of intention of profit is already made by the third party, the rescission is  made by the manifestation of intention to the third party."

1. **Voidable Act**: The query mentions a contract being "rescinded," which implies a voidable act due to fraud, so (Query entails 1).
2. **Counterparty Identification**: While the counterparty is mentioned, the key action (rescission) involves the third party and not directly the identification of the counterparty for the purpose of voidance or ratification as outlined in Article 123, so (Query not entails 2).
3. **Manifestation of Intention**: The query talks about "manifestation of intention of profit" made by the third party and the rescission being made by a manifestation of intention to the third party, aligning with this factor, so (Query entails 3).
4. **Notification to Counterparty**: The query specifies that the rescission is made by the manifestation of intention to the third party, not directly to the counterparty as Article 123 stipulates, thus (Query not entails 4).

### Task 2:
The query discusses a specific scenario involving fraud and rescission but does so in a manner that assumes certain legal actions are valid or possible without explicitly stating their validity under law. However, it implies a process for handling rescissions due to fraud, which might be seen as outlining a legally valid procedure within its specific context. Since the query outlines a procedure for rescission and manifestation of intention but does so in a way that seems to assume legality rather than questioning it, and given the complexity of determining legal validity without explicit statements, we lean towards an interpretation that sees this as describing a process without directly challenging its legal basis.

Therefore, considering the nuances involved, (Query Valid).

 To assess the validity of a query against Article 424, we first need to factor the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Condition for Rescission**: An obligee can demand the court to rescind an act by the obligor that prejudices the obligee.
2. **Knowledge Requirement**: The act must be committed with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.
3. **Beneficiary's Knowledge**: The provisions do not apply if the beneficiary of the act does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.
4. **Subject Matter Limitation**: The act in question must pertain to property rights.
5. **Pre-existing Claim**: The obligee's claim must have arisen from a cause that existed before the act.
6. **Enforceability by Compulsory Execution**: The obligee's claim must be enforceable by compulsory execution for a demand of rescission to be valid.

### End of Factoring

<Number of factors : 6>

Given this factoring, we can now evaluate queries against Article 424 based on these factors. However, since no specific query is provided to assess against the article, I will create a hypothetical query for demonstration purposes:

Query: Can an obligee demand rescission of an act that does not pertain to property rights but was done with knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee?

To determine if this query is legally valid within the context of Article 424:

- The query touches on factors 1 (Condition for Rescission), 2 (Knowledge Requirement), and 4 (Subject Matter Limitation).
- It does not directly address factors 3 (Beneficiary's Knowledge), 5 (Pre-existing Claim), or 6 (Enforceability by Compulsory Execution).
- The article specifically states that the provisions do not apply to an act with a subject matter other than property rights (factor 4).

Therefore, considering factor 4 and its implications on the query, the response would be "N" because the query involves an act not pertaining to property rights, which is explicitly excluded by Article 424.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 424, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee can demand rescission because the act was committed with knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee, and the condition for rescission is met.

2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: Even though the beneficiary's knowledge and subject matter limitation factors are present, the absence of other crucial factors like the condition for rescission and knowledge requirement renders the demand invalid.

3. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The obligee's claim arose from a pre-existing cause, and the condition for rescission is met, making the demand valid.

4. (2, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The act was committed with knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee, and the obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution, making the demand valid.

5. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the condition for rescission and beneficiary's knowledge factors are present, the lack of knowledge about prejudicing the obligee on the part of the beneficiary at the time of the act makes the demand invalid.

6. (4, 5, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The subject matter pertains to property rights, the obligee's claim arose from a pre-existing cause, and the claim is enforceable by compulsory execution, making the demand valid.

7. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Despite the act being committed with knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee and the beneficiary's knowledge, the absence of other crucial factors like the condition for rescission and subject matter limitation renders the demand invalid.

8. (1, 4, 6 | Y) 
Justification: The condition for rescission is met, the subject matter pertains to property rights, and the obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution, making the demand valid.

9. (5, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although the obligee's claim arose from a pre-existing cause and the beneficiary's knowledge factor is present, the lack of other crucial factors like the condition for rescission and knowledge requirement makes the demand invalid.

10. (2, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The act was committed with knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee, the subject matter pertains to property rights, and the obligee's claim arose from a pre-existing cause, making the demand valid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors and yields a clear verdict based on Article 424.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Factor 1
The query mentions "the rescission of a fraudulent act is performed by the court based on the demand of the obligee," which directly relates to an obligee demanding the court to rescind an act that prejudices them. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Factor 2
The query does not explicitly mention that the act was committed with knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee. Thus, (Query not entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Factor 3
There is no information in the query about the beneficiary's knowledge at the time of the act. Hence, (Query not entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Factor 4
The query does not specify that the act pertains to property rights. Therefore, (Query not entails 4).

## Step 5: Assessing Factor 5
There is no mention in the query of the obligee's claim arising from a cause that existed before the act. So, (Query not entails 5).

## Step 6: Assessing Factor 6
The query does not discuss whether the obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution. Thus, (Query not entails 6).

## Step 7: Determining Query Validity
Given that the query discusses the rescission of a fraudulent act based on the demand of the obligee but lacks specific details to fully align with all factors of Article 424, especially regarding the subject matter and enforceability, we cannot conclusively determine its validity purely based on the information provided. However, since it talks about a legal process (rescission by the court) without explicitly stating that the act is legally invalid or valid under Article 424's conditions, we lean towards it being a description of a process rather than a declaration of validity or invalidity.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given sentence with respect to Article 192, let's first break down the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Commencement of Possession**: The possession of movables must be commenced.
2. **Peaceful and Open Possession**: The commencement of possession must be peaceful and open.
3. **Transactional Act**: The possession starts by a transactional act.
4. **Good Faith**: The person possessing the movables must do so in good faith.
5. **Without Negligence**: The possession must be without negligence.
6. **Immediate Exercise of Rights**: The person acquires rights to the movables immediately if the conditions are met.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 6

Given that we need to evaluate a query against Article 192, but the specific query isn't provided in your prompt, I'll outline how one might approach determining legal validity based on these factors:

- **Query Analysis**: To determine if a query is legally valid with respect to Article 192, we must see if it aligns with or contradicts any of the factors outlined.
- **Alignment with Factors**: If the query requires peaceful and open possession, commencement by a transactional act, good faith, absence of negligence, and leads to the immediate exercise of rights over the movables, then it logically follows the article (Response: Y).
- **Contradiction or Missing Factors**: If the query suggests acquisition of rights without meeting these conditions (e.g., possessing through stealth, in bad faith, or with negligence), or if it implies that the acquisition of rights is not immediate under the given conditions, then it does not logically follow the article (Response: N).

Without a specific query to evaluate against Article 192, we cannot provide a definitive Y or N response. However, this framework provides the structure for analyzing any query regarding the acquisition of rights over movables as per Article 192.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate case scenarios based on the factors outlined from Article 192, we will consider various combinations of these factors to determine whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N). Remember, the factors are:

1. **Commencement of Possession**
2. **Peaceful and Open Possession**
3. **Transactional Act**
4. **Good Faith**
5. **Without Negligence**
6. **Immediate Exercise of Rights**

Here are 10 case scenarios with different combinations of these factors:

1. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - In this scenario, the possession of movables commenced peacefully and openly through a transactional act. Although good faith and absence of negligence are not mentioned, the presence of commencement, peaceful and open possession, and transactional act provide a strong basis for legal validity.

2. (4, 5 | N) - Here, the person possesses in good faith and without negligence, but there's no mention of how they commenced possession or if it was through a transactional act. Without these essential elements, the juridical act cannot be considered legally valid.

3. (1, 3, 4 | Y) - The commencement of possession occurred through a transactional act, and the person is in good faith. Despite lacking information on peaceful and open possession and absence of negligence, the combination of commencement, transactional act, and good faith leans towards legal validity.

4. (2, 5, 6 | Y) - This scenario involves peaceful and open possession without negligence, leading to the immediate exercise of rights. Although it doesn't explicitly mention commencement by a transactional act or good faith, the overall context suggests a legally valid situation due to the presence of key factors like peaceful possession and immediate exercise of rights.

5. (1, 2 | N) - Commencement of possession occurred peacefully and openly, but there's no information on whether it was through a transactional act, in good faith, or without negligence. This lack of crucial details makes the juridical act invalid.

6. (3, 4, 5 | Y) - Possession started with a transactional act, and the person acted in good faith without negligence. Although we don't have information on peaceful and open commencement or immediate exercise of rights, these factors collectively support legal validity.

7. (1, 4, 5, 6 | Y) - This scenario includes commencement of possession, good faith, absence of negligence, and leads to the immediate exercise of rights. Despite missing the factor of peaceful and open possession, the comprehensive nature of the other factors present suggests a legally valid act.

8. (2, 3, 6 | Y) - The possession is peaceful and open, commenced through a transactional act, and results in the immediate exercise of rights. Even though good faith and absence of negligence are not explicitly mentioned, the overall setup indicates a legally valid situation due to the presence of key elements like peaceful possession and transactional commencement.

9. (4, 6 | N) - The person is in good faith, and there's an immediate exercise of rights, but we lack information on how possession commenced or if it was peaceful, open, through a transactional act, or without negligence. This absence of vital factors makes the act invalid.

10. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | Y) - All factors are present: commencement of possession occurred peacefully and openly through a transactional act, in good faith, without negligence, and led to the immediate exercise of rights. This comprehensive fulfillment of all conditions clearly indicates a legally valid juridical act.

Each case has been designed to use a unique combination of factors to demonstrate how different scenarios might play out under Article 192, ensuring that no two cases are identical.

Given the query "Provisions for immediate acquisition do not apply in cases where the property of an inheritee that possessed another person's movables is succeeded by inheritance," let's assess whether it entails each factor related to Article 192.

1. **Commencement of Possession**: The query discusses a scenario involving possession but does so in the context of inheritance, which might not necessarily involve the commencement of new possession as defined by Article 192. Therefore, (Query not entails 1).
2. **Peaceful and Open Possession**: There's no mention of how the possession is commenced or maintained, thus (Query not entails 2).
3. **Transactional Act**: The query mentions inheritance, which could be considered a transactional act, but it does so in a context that questions immediate acquisition rights rather than establishing them. Hence, (Query entails 3) because inheritance can be seen as a form of transactional act, albeit not directly related to the acquisition process described in Article 192.
4. **Good Faith**: The query doesn't explicitly mention good faith or bad faith, so (Query not entails 4).
5. **Without Negligence**: Similar to good faith, negligence isn't mentioned, thus (Query not entails 5).
6. **Immediate Exercise of Rights**: The query specifically mentions that provisions for immediate acquisition do not apply in certain cases, which directly relates to the concept of immediate exercise of rights. Therefore, (Query entails 6).

### Task 2:
Given the query "Provisions for immediate acquisition do not apply in cases where the property of an inheritee that possessed another person's movables is succeeded by inheritance," it suggests a scenario where certain provisions (specifically those related to immediate acquisition as per Article 192) are not applicable. This implies that under specific conditions (inheritance), the usual rules for immediate acquisition of rights over movables do not hold, which indicates a condition under which juridical acts or obligations might be considered invalid in the context provided by Article 192.

Therefore, the query seems to express that under certain circumstances, the typical legal validity of acquiring rights immediately as per Article 192 does not apply, suggesting an exception to the general rule rather than a direct validation or invalidation of all juridical acts. However, since it outlines a condition where immediate acquisition provisions do not apply, it leans towards indicating a scenario where the usual legal validity (immediate acquisition) is not present.

Thus, (Query Invalid), because it presents a case where the general principle of Article 192 does not apply, implying an exception to the typical legal validity of acquiring rights immediately.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To address the query regarding the legal validity of a given statement with respect to Article 192, we first need to factor the article into its key components. Then, we will analyze these factors in relation to the query provided.


### Begin Factoring
1. **Possession Initiation**: The act of commencing possession must be peaceful and open.
2. **Transactional Act**: The initiation of possession is through a transactional act.
3. **Good Faith Requirement**: The person possessing the movables must do so in good faith.
4. **Non-negligence Requirement**: The possession must also be without negligence.
5. **Immediate Rights Exercise**: The person acquires rights to exercise with respect to the movables immediately upon meeting the above conditions.

### End of Factoring


Given the factors extracted from Article 192, we need to evaluate the query: "A person that commences the possession of movables peacefully and openly by a transactional act acquires the rights that are exercised with respect to the movables immediately if the person possesses it in good faith and without negligence."


This query essentially restates the conditions outlined in Article 192. To determine its legal validity, we consider whether all necessary factors from Article 192 are present in the query:


1. **Possession Initiation** is mentioned as being peaceful and open.
2. **Transactional Act** is noted as the means of initiating possession.
3. **Good Faith Requirement** and **Non-negligence Requirement** are both included in the query.
4. **Immediate Rights Exercise** is also covered, stating that rights are acquired immediately under these conditions.


Since all factors from Article 192 are present in the query and accurately represented, we conclude that the query logically follows the legal context provided by Article 192.

**Number of factors : 5**

The final answer is: $\boxed{Y}$
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate 10 unique case scenarios based on the factors extracted from Article 192, we will consider various combinations of these factors. The factors are:

1. **Possession Initiation**: The act of commencing possession must be peaceful and open.
2. **Transactional Act**: The initiation of possession is through a transactional act.
3. **Good Faith Requirement**: The person possessing the movables must do so in good faith.
4. **Non-negligence Requirement**: The possession must also be without negligence.
5. **Immediate Rights Exercise**: The person acquires rights to exercise with respect to the movables immediately upon meeting the above conditions.

Here are 10 case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors:

1. (1, 2 | N) - This scenario includes peaceful and open possession initiation and a transactional act but lacks good faith, non-negligence, and immediate rights exercise, making it invalid.
2. (3, 4 | N) - Possessing in good faith and without negligence is not enough without the other factors; thus, this scenario is invalid.
3. (1, 3, 5 | N) - Despite having peaceful initiation, good faith, and immediate rights exercise, lacking a transactional act and non-negligence makes this scenario invalid.
4. (2, 4, 5 | N) - Having a transactional act, non-negligence, and immediate rights exercise but missing peaceful initiation and good faith renders this scenario invalid.
5. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - This scenario includes peaceful and open possession, a transactional act, and good faith, which are crucial for validity, suggesting it could be valid under certain interpretations emphasizing these factors.
6. (4, 5 | N) - Non-negligence and immediate rights exercise alone are insufficient without the other foundational factors, making this scenario invalid.
7. (1, 4, 5 | N) - Peaceful initiation, non-negligence, and immediate rights exercise lack a transactional act and good faith, rendering this scenario invalid.
8. (2, 3 | N) - A transactional act and good faith are present but without peaceful initiation, non-negligence, and immediate rights exercise, making it invalid.
9. (1, 2, 4, 5 | Y) - This combination includes all factors except good faith, which might be considered valid under a strict interpretation focusing on the actions rather than the intent behind them.
10. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y) - Including all factors as per Article 192, this scenario is clearly valid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors to assess the legal validity based on Article 192's requirements.

 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1:
1. **Possession Initiation**: The query mentions accepting the transfer of movables, implying a peaceful and open initiation of possession. Therefore, (Query entails 1).
2. **Transactional Act**: The acceptance of the transfer can be considered a transactional act, hence (Query entails 2).
3. **Good Faith Requirement**: The query explicitly states that the person is in good faith, so (Query entails 3).
4. **Non-negligence Requirement**: It's mentioned that the person is without fault regarding the incapability of intention of the counterparty, implying non-negligence, thus (Query entails 4).
5. **Immediate Rights Exercise**: The query concludes with the acquisition of ownership due to immediate acquisition, meaning (Query entails 5).

### Task 2:
Given that the query outlines a scenario where a person acquires ownership of a movable under specific conditions (good faith and without fault regarding the counterparty's incapability of intention), and it leads to the conclusion that the person acquires the ownership due to immediate acquisition, this suggests that the juridical act (accepting the transfer) is legally valid under these conditions. Therefore, the answer is (Query Valid).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid with the context of the given article, we must first factor the article into its key components or factors. The provided article deals with the acquisition of ownership of movables and immovables without an owner.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Ownership Acquisition**: Ownership of movables without an owner can be acquired.
2. **Method of Acquisition for Movables**: The method of acquiring ownership of movables is by possessing them with the intention to own.
3. **Immovables Without Owner**: Immovables that do not have an owner are considered to belong to a specific entity.
4. **Entity for Ownerless Immovables**: The National Treasury is the entity that owns immovables without an owner.
5. **Intention to Own**: For movables, the intention to own is a crucial factor in acquiring ownership.

### End of Factoring

Number of factors : 5

Given this factoring and without a specific query provided to assess against these factors, we can still reason about how a query might be evaluated:

- If a query pertains to the acquisition of movables through possession with the intention to own (factor 2), it would likely be considered valid ("Y") as it aligns directly with the article.
- If a query suggests that immovables without an owner can be acquired by individuals through possession and intention, it would be invalid ("N") because, according to factor 4, such immovables belong to the National Treasury.
- Queries about the requirement for the intention to own in acquiring movables (factor 5) or the general principle of ownership acquisition (factor 1) would need careful consideration based on their specifics but could potentially be valid if they align with the article's principles.

Without a specific query, it's not possible to provide a definitive "Y" or "N" answer. However, this analysis demonstrates how one might approach evaluating queries against the provided legal article by factoring its key components and considering whether the query logically follows from these factors.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 239, I'll generate 10 unique case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The case involves acquiring ownership of movables without an owner through possession with the intention to own, which aligns directly with factors 1 and 2 of the article.

2. (3, 4 | N) 
Justification: This scenario involves immovables without an owner, which, according to factor 4, belong to the National Treasury. Without any mention of acquisition through possession or intention to own for movables, it does not align with the method outlined in the article for acquiring ownership.

3. (5 | Y) 
Justification: The case focuses solely on the intention to own as a factor in acquiring ownership of movables. Since this directly relates to how one can acquire ownership of movables without an owner (as per factor 2), it is considered legally valid.

4. (1, 3 | N) 
Justification: This scenario combines the general principle of acquiring ownership with the concept of immovables without an owner. However, since the article specifies different treatments for movables and immovables (with immovables belonging to the National Treasury), this combination does not directly align with a valid method of acquisition outlined in the article.

5. (2, 4 | N) 
Justification: Attempting to acquire ownership of immovables through possession with the intention to own contradicts factor 4, which states that ownerless immovables belong to the National Treasury. Thus, applying the method for movables to immovables is not valid.

6. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: This case involves the general principle of ownership acquisition and the specific requirement of having an intention to own for movables. Since this aligns with how ownership of movables can be acquired (through possession with the intention to own), it is considered legally valid.

7. (3, 5 | N) 
Justification: This scenario combines immovables without an owner with the intention to own. However, since immovables are assigned to the National Treasury regardless of intent, this combination does not represent a valid method for individual acquisition of ownership.

8. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Focusing on possessing movables with the intention to own, which is the method outlined in factor 2 and reinforced by the necessity of an intention to own as per factor 5, makes this scenario legally valid for acquiring ownership.

9. (1, 4 | N) 
Justification: While factor 1 allows for the acquisition of ownership of movables without an owner, attempting to apply this general principle directly to immovables (which belong to the National Treasury as per factor 4) is not valid according to the article's distinction between movables and immovables.

10. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: This scenario attempts to apply the method of acquiring ownership of movables (through possession with the intention to own) to immovables without an owner. Since immovables are treated differently according to the article, belonging to the National Treasury rather than being acquirable through individual intent and action, this is considered invalid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors from Article 239 and determines whether the juridical act or obligations resulting from these factors are legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing the presence of factors in the query
The query states, "By possessing a movable without an owner with the intention to own, the possessor acquires ownership of the movable." This directly relates to the method of acquiring ownership of movables as described in the article.

## Step 2: Identifying specific factor entailment
Given that the query mentions possessing a movable with the intention to own, it aligns with factor 2 ("Method of Acquisition for Movables") and also implies factor 1 ("Ownership Acquisition") since it's about acquiring ownership. Additionally, it touches upon factor 5 ("Intention to Own") as this is a key element in the acquisition process described.

## Step 3: Determining query validity
The query essentially rephrases the content of Article 239(1), which states that ownership of movables without an owner can be acquired by possessing them with the intention to own. Therefore, it explicitly determines that the juridical act (acquiring ownership through possession and intention) is legally valid according to the given article.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails 1), (Query entails 2), (Query entails 5), (Query Valid)}$

 To address the query regarding the validity of a sentence based on the given legal articles, we first need to factor these articles into their key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Possession Rights**: A possessor has the right to file a possessory action as outlined in Article 197.
2. **Forcible Dispossession**: If a possessor is forcibly dispossessed, they can demand restitution and compensation by filing an action for recovery of possession (Article 200(1)).
3. **Action Against Successors**: Generally, an action for recovery of possession cannot be filed against a specific successor of the person who forcibly took possession, unless that successor knew about the unlawful taking (Article 200(2)).
4. **Representation in Possession**: A person can take possession on behalf of another person and has similar rights as outlined (implied from Article 197).
5. **Conditions for Filing Actions**: The conditions under which a possessor or their representative can file actions related to possession.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given these factors, we need to evaluate the query to determine its validity based on the provided articles. However, since there's no specific query sentence provided in your request, I'll create a hypothetical query for illustration purposes: "A possessor who was forcibly dispossessed can file an action against anyone who currently possesses the item, regardless of how they acquired it."

To assess this query:
- **Possession Rights** and **Forcible Dispossession** factors support the idea that a possessor has rights to reclaim possession.
- The **Action Against Successors** factor introduces a condition that not all current possessors can be held liable, specifically successors without knowledge of the unlawful taking.

Given this analysis, the hypothetical query seems partially invalidated by the articles because it overlooks the exception for successors without knowledge. Thus, based on the factors and considering skepticism towards any lack of evidence or potential loopholes, the response would be "N" due to the missing consideration of the successor's knowledge in the query.

However, please provide a specific query related to these articles for a precise assessment.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 197 and Article 200, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a specific subset of factors has occurred and provides a justification for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

1. **(1, 2 | Y)**
Justification: If a possessor files an action after being forcibly dispossessed (Factor 2), leveraging their right to file a possessory action (Factor 1), they are within their legal rights as outlined in Article 197 and Article 200(1).

2. **(3, 5 | N)**
Justification: If the conditions for filing actions (Factor 5) are not met against a specific successor who did not know about the unlawful taking (Factor 3), then according to Article 200(2), the action would be invalid because it does not meet the specified exceptions.

3. **(1, 4 | Y)**
Justification: A person taking possession on behalf of another (Factor 4) and filing a possessory action (Factor 1) is legally valid as per Article 197, which includes persons who take possession on behalf of others.

4. **(2, 3 | N)**
Justification: If a possessor was forcibly dispossessed (Factor 2) but tries to file an action against a successor without knowledge of the unlawful taking (Factor 3), it would be invalid based on Article 200(2), which protects such successors from actions for recovery of possession.

5. **(4, 5 | Y)**
Justification: A person representing another in possession (Factor 4) and meeting the conditions for filing actions (Factor 5) can legally file a possessory action as their rights are recognized by Article 197, implying they have similar standing to actual possessors.

6. **(1, 3 | N)**
Justification: If a possessor tries to file an action against a successor without considering the knowledge of the unlawful taking (Factor 3), simply because they have the right to file a possessory action (Factor 1), it would be invalid due to the specific protections given to successors in Article 200(2).

7. **(2, 4 | Y)**
Justification: A person who was forcibly dispossessed while holding possession on behalf of another (Factor 4) and seeks restitution (Factor 2) is acting within their legal rights as both Article 197 and Article 200(1) support such actions.

8. **(5, 3 | N)**
Justification: If the conditions for filing an action are met (Factor 5), but it's against a successor without knowledge of the unlawful taking (Factor 3), then according to Article 200(2), the action is invalid because successors without such knowledge are protected.

9. **(1, 2, 4 | Y)**
Justification: A possessor who was forcibly dispossessed while holding for another (Factor 4) and files an action for recovery of possession (Factors 1 and 2) is legally valid as all these conditions align with the rights granted by Article 197 and Article 200(1).

10. **(3, 4 | N)**
Justification: If a person tries to file an action on behalf of another against a successor without knowledge of the unlawful taking (Factor 3), simply because they represent someone in possession (Factor 4), it's invalid due to the protections afforded to successors under Article 200(2).

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors and their implications for the legality of the juridical act, ensuring no two cases are the same.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 1
The query discusses the scenario of a possessor being forcibly dispossessed and demanding the return of the item, which aligns with the concept of possession rights as outlined in Article 197. Therefore, (Query entails 1).

## Step 2: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 2
The query specifically mentions a situation where the possession is forcibly dispossessed, allowing the possessor to demand the return based on an action for recovery of possession, which directly relates to the concept outlined in Article 200(1). Hence, (Query entails 2).

## Step 3: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 3
The query does not explicitly address the issue of successors or their knowledge regarding the unlawful taking of possession. It focuses on the general right to demand return after forcible dispossession without mentioning specifics about successors. Therefore, (Query not entails 3).

## Step 4: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 4
The query does not discuss representation in possession or a person taking possession on behalf of another. Thus, (Query not entails 4).

## Step 5: Assessing Query Entailment of Factor 5
The query implies conditions under which a possessor can file actions related to possession by discussing the scenario of forcible dispossession and the right to demand return. However, it does not explicitly outline all conditions for filing such actions as might be inferred from the articles. Given this, (Query entails 5) because it touches upon the concept of conditions for filing actions, albeit indirectly.

## Step 6: Evaluating Query Validity
The query suggests that a possessor can demand the return of an item after being forcibly dispossessed, which aligns with the legal provisions outlined in Articles 197 and 200(1). It does not introduce any scenarios or conclusions that would explicitly invalidate the juridical acts or obligations based on the provided articles. Therefore, (Query Valid).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query logically follows from the given legal article, let's first break down the article into its key components or factors.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Presumption of Intention to Own**: A possessor is presumed to have the intention to own the thing they possess.
2. **Good Faith Possession**: The possession is presumed to be in good faith.
3. **Peaceful and Open Possession**: The possession is presumed to be peaceful and open.
4. **Continuity of Possession**: If there's evidence of possession at two different points, it's presumed that the possession continued during the interval between those points.
5. **Evidence of Possession**: For the presumption of continuity, there needs to be evidence of possession at two distinct times.

### End of Factoring
<Number of factors : 5>

Given this factoring and without a specific query to evaluate against Article 186, we can consider how these factors might influence the validity of potential queries. 

For example, if a query assumes that a possessor has the intention to own something simply because they possess it, it would logically follow from the article (Factor 1). Similarly, if a query posits that possession is continuous between two known points of possession, it aligns with Factor 4.

However, without a specific query provided in your prompt, we cannot directly assess its validity against Article 186. If you provide a query related to Article 186, I can evaluate whether it logically follows from the factors outlined above and respond accordingly with either "Y" for valid or "N" for not valid, explaining which factors support or contradict the query.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 186, I will generate 10 unique case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of the factors occurred. Here are the cases:

1. (1 | Y) 
Justification: If only the presumption of intention to own is present, it still aligns with the article's first part, which presumes a possessor intends to own the thing they possess.

2. (2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: Even if good faith and peaceful/open possession are the only factors present, these characteristics align with how possession is presumed under the article, supporting the validity of the juridical act.

3. (4 | Y) 
Justification: The presumption of continuity of possession between two points in time directly follows from the article's second part, making the juridical act valid based on this factor alone.

4. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: Combining the intention to own with good faith possession reinforces the validity of the juridical act, as both are presumed under the article.

5. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Peaceful and open possession, combined with the continuity of possession, supports the legitimacy of the juridical act under the presumptions outlined in the article.

6. (2, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Good faith possession coupled with the presumption of continuous possession between two known points makes the juridical act valid, as both factors are directly supported by the article.

7. (1, 3 | Y) 
Justification: The intention to own, combined with peaceful and open possession, aligns well with the article's presumptions about how a possessor holds an item, thus validating the juridical act.

8. (5 | N) 
Justification: Evidence of possession at two distinct times is necessary for the presumption of continuity but does not alone validate a juridical act without other factors being present that directly relate to the nature or presumptions of possession itself.

9. (1, 2, 3 | Y) 
Justification: When all three initial factors (intention to own, good faith, and peaceful/open possession) are present, they strongly support the validity of the juridical act under the article's first part.

10. (1, 4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The combination of intending to own, having evidence of possession at two points in time (thus presuming continuity), and the inherent presumption of ownership intention due to possession, provides a strong basis for considering the juridical act valid under Article 186.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 186 and provides a justification based on those factors for determining whether the juridical act is legally valid (Y) or invalid (N).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Assessing Query Entailment of Factors
To assess whether the query entails each factor, we'll go through the factors one by one in relation to the given query: "A possessor is presumed to possess in good faith, peacefully, and in public, but is not presumed to have intention to own."

- For Factor 1 (**Presumption of Intention to Own**), the query explicitly states that there is no presumption of intention to own, which directly contradicts this factor. Thus, (Query not entails 1).
- For Factor 2 (**Good Faith Possession**), the query mentions possession "in good faith," aligning with this factor. Thus, (Query entails 2).
- For Factor 3 (**Peaceful and Open Possession**), the query states "peacefully, and in public," which seems to align closely with the concept of peaceful and open possession, considering "in public" can be interpreted as a form of openness. Thus, (Query entails 3).
- For Factor 4 (**Continuity of Possession**), there's no mention of continuity or evidence of possession at two different points in time, so this factor is not directly addressed by the query. Thus, (Query not entails 4).
- For Factor 5 (**Evidence of Possession**), similar to Factor 4, the query does not provide information about evidence of possession at distinct times. Thus, (Query not entails 5).

## Step 2: Evaluating Query Validity
Given the query and its relationship with the factors, we now evaluate if the query explicitly determines that juridical acts or obligations are legally valid or invalid based on Article 186.

The query directly contradicts Factor 1 by stating there's no presumption of intention to own, which is a key point in Article 186. However, it aligns with Factors 2 and 3 regarding good faith and peaceful/open possession. The critical aspect here is whether the query's statement about not presuming an intention to own invalidates its alignment with the article's overall premise.

Since Article 186 explicitly states that a possessor is presumed to possess with the intention to own, and the query directly contradicts this by stating there is no such presumption of intention to own, we can conclude that the query does not align with the legal principle as outlined in Article 186. Therefore, (Query Invalid).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query Invalid)}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To determine whether a query is legally valid within the context provided by Article 185, we must first break down the key elements presented in the article and then assess how these elements interact with the query in question.

### Begin Factoring
1. **Assumption of Intention**: The article starts with an assumption about the possessor's intention based on the nature of the title.
2. **Nature of Possession**: It mentions that the nature of the possessor's possession does not change unless certain conditions are met.
3. **Manifestation of Intent**: One condition for a change in the nature of possession is if the possessor manifests an intention to own to the person who put the thing under their possession.
4. **New Title with Intention to Own**: Another condition is if the possessor commences possession under a new title with the intention to own from that time.
5. **Change in Possession Status**: The article implies that the status of possession (e.g., from non-ownership intent to ownership intent) can change based on the actions or declarations of the possessor.

### End of Factoring
#### Number of factors : 5

Given these factors, a query would be considered legally valid if it aligns with the conditions and implications outlined in Article 185. For instance, a query that suggests a possessor's intention to own can change based on their actions or declarations towards the original owner or under a new title would be valid. However, without a specific query provided to assess against these factors, we cannot directly classify it as "Y" (valid) or "N" (not valid).

To apply this analysis to a query:
- If the query aligns with the idea that possession's nature can change through manifestation of ownership intent or starting possession under a new title with such intent, it would logically follow the article's context.
- If the query suggests changes in possession status without referencing these specific conditions (manifestation of intent or new title with intent to own), it might not align well with the article.

Since there is no specific query provided to evaluate against Article 185, I will demonstrate how this analysis could apply to a hypothetical query:

**Hypothetical Query**: Can a possessor's intention to own be considered as changing if they start using the property in a manner that suggests ownership without notifying the original owner?

Applying our factored analysis:
- This query touches on the **Nature of Possession** (Factor 2) and potentially **Manifestation of Intent** (Factor 3), but it does not explicitly mention notification to the person who put the thing under their possession or commencing possession under a new title.
- The article specifies that manifestation of intent should be to the person who put the thing under the possessor's possession, which might not directly apply if the query implies a change in use without explicit communication.

Given this hypothetical scenario, the answer could lean towards "N" because the query does not strictly adhere to the conditions outlined for changing the nature of possession as described in Article 185. However, the actual validity would depend on the precise wording and context of the real query in question.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 185, I will generate 10 case scenarios with different combinations of factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y) 
Justification: The assumption of intention and the nature of possession are both present, indicating that the possessor's initial state is being considered. Since these are fundamental aspects of Article 185, their presence alone does not invalidate the juridical act.

2. (3 | N) 
Justification: Manifestation of intent to own without any reference to the person who put the thing under possession or a new title with intention to own does not align with the conditions for changing the nature of possession as outlined in Article 185.

3. (1, 4 | Y) 
Justification: The assumption of intention combined with commencing possession under a new title with an intention to own directly relates to the conditions under which the nature of possession can change, making this scenario legally valid.

4. (2, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The nature of possession and the potential for a change in possession status are both key elements of Article 185. Their presence suggests that the scenario is considering the dynamics of possession as intended by the article, thus it's legally valid.

5. (1, 3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: This combination includes assumption of intention, manifestation of intent to own, and commencing possession under a new title with an intention to own. All these factors are directly related to how the nature of possession can change according to Article 185, making this scenario legally valid.

6. (2, 3 | N) 
Justification: While the nature of possession and manifestation of intent are present, there's no indication that this manifestation is directed towards the person who put the thing under possession or that a new title with intention to own has been commenced. This lacks key elements for legal validity as per Article 185.

7. (4, 5 | Y) 
Justification: Commencing possession under a new title with an intention to own and the potential for a change in possession status are both critical aspects of how possession's nature can legally evolve according to Article 185, making this scenario valid.

8. (1, 2, 3 | N) 
Justification: Although assumption of intention, nature of possession, and manifestation of intent to own are all present, the article requires that manifestation be to the person who put the thing under possession or under a new title for the nature of possession to change. Without explicit mention of these conditions being met, this scenario is considered invalid.

9. (1, 5 | Y) 
Justification: The assumption of intention and the potential for a change in possession status are fundamental to understanding how possession can evolve according to Article 185. Their presence suggests consideration of the article's core principles, making this scenario legally valid.

10. (3, 4 | Y) 
Justification: Manifestation of intent to own combined with commencing possession under a new title with an intention to own directly aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 185 for changing the nature of possession. This combination explicitly meets the article's criteria, making this scenario legally valid.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors from Article 185 and offers a clear determination of legal validity based on those factors.
