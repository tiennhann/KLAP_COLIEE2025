 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's break it down into steps:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The provided text includes Article 128, which discusses conditions under juridical acts, and a specific scenario where A promises B to give car "X" if B passes a medical department graduation examination. However, A sells the car to C before B can fulfill the condition.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle stated is that while it's uncertain whether a condition will be fulfilled in a juridical act subject to a condition, one party may not prejudice the other party's interests that would arise upon fulfillment of the condition.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- The condition for applying this rule is that there must be uncertainty about whether the condition of the juridical act will be fulfilled.
- Another condition is that one party must not act in a way to prejudice the interests of the other party, which would arise if the condition were met.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
If one party prejudices the other's potential interests before the condition is fulfilled, they may be liable for damages or compensation arising from their actions that prevent the fulfillment of the condition or its consequences.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
No explicit exceptions are mentioned in Article 128 or the query scenario regarding selling the car to a third party before the condition is met, but one could argue that an exception might exist if the act of prejudicing interests was unavoidable due to circumstances beyond the control of the party.

### Output Format

- **Rule(s):** A party may not prejudice another's potential interests under a conditional juridical act until it's certain whether the condition will be fulfilled.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Uncertainty about the fulfillment of the condition.
  - One party acts to prejudice the other's potential interests.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The party that prejudices may be liable for damages or compensation.
- **Exception(s):** No explicit exceptions are provided, but unavoidable circumstances might potentially serve as a basis for an exception.

Given this analysis and the query about A selling car "X" to C before B passes the examination, we can assess whether it entails base-level factors (B1) and if it agrees or disagrees with the root (R1).

- The scenario where A sells the car before B fulfills the condition directly pertains to the rule stated in Article 128. Therefore, **(query entails B1)** because both deal with a situation where one party's actions potentially prejudice another's interests under a conditional agreement.
  
- Considering the root (R1) as the principle that a party should not act to prejudice another's potential interests under a condition, and given that A selling the car to C does indeed prejudice B's interest in receiving the car upon passing the examination, **(query agree R1)**. This is because both the query scenario and the root principle are concerned with protecting the potential interests of one party from being undermined by another before a condition is fulfilled.

Upon reevaluation, these conclusions remain consistent: The query does indeed entail base-level factors as it discusses a specific situation where A's actions could prejudice B's future interests under the conditional agreement. Furthermore, both the root principle and the query agree that such prejudicial actions should not occur, supporting the notion that A's sale of the car to C before B passes the examination would be in violation of this principle.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The provided text includes two articles from a civil legal code: Article 484, which discusses the place of performance for obligations, and Article 401, which addresses the quality of goods to be delivered when only the type is specified.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** Unless otherwise specified, delivery of a specific thing must occur at its location when the claim arose, and other obligations are fulfilled at the obligee's current domicile.
- **Rule 2:** If goods are specified only by type and quality cannot be determined, the obligor must deliver medium-quality goods.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition for Rule 1:** No particular intention is manifested regarding the place of performance.
- **Condition for Rule 2:** The object of a claim is designated only by type, and its quality cannot be determined from the nature of the juridical act or the parties' intention.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence of Rule 1:** Delivery occurs at the specified locations based on the type of obligation.
- **Consequence of Rule 2:** The obligor delivers a medium-quality item if quality cannot be otherwise determined.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception/Limitation for Rule 1:** Trading hours are specified by laws, regulations, or customs, affecting when performance can be made or demanded.
- **Exception/Limitation for Rule 2:** If the obligor completes necessary acts to deliver a specific item or designates an item with the obligee's consent, that item becomes the subject matter of the claim.

### Output Format
**Rule(s):**
1. Delivery location is determined by the type of obligation unless otherwise specified.
2. Medium quality goods must be delivered if only the type is specified and quality cannot be determined.

**Condition(s):**
1. No specific intention regarding delivery location.
2. Goods are specified only by type without determinable quality.

**Legal Consequence(s):**
1. Delivery occurs based on obligation type at specified locations.
2. Medium-quality goods are delivered when type but not quality is specified.

**Exception(s):**
1. Trading hours affect performance timing.
2. Specific item designation by the obligor or with obligee's consent alters the subject matter of the claim.

### Justification of Query and Base-Level Factor Agreement
Given the query about wine delivery, where the buyer refuses to accept the wine delivered to their domicile and the wine is later lost due to arson, we analyze if this scenario aligns with any base-level factors (B1) or agrees/disagrees with a root node (R1).

The query involves specific circumstances: 
- The subject of sale (wine) is specified only by type.
- Delivery is made to the buyer's domicile as per Article 484.
- The buyer refuses acceptance, and the goods are subsequently lost due to arson.

Considering these details:
- **(query entails B1):** Yes, because the scenario considers the delivery of wine based on its type (a base-level factor related to the quality and specification of goods).
  
Given that there's an implied root node regarding obligations and their fulfillments under specific conditions:
- **(query agree R1):** Yes, if we consider R1 as the principle that obligations should be fulfilled according to specified or implied terms (such as delivery location and quality), then the query agrees with this root because it discusses a scenario where the seller attempts to fulfill the obligation by delivering the wine to the buyer's domicile but is relieved of further responsibility due to circumstances beyond their control.

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances of legal obligations and the specifics of Article 484 and Article 401:
- The query indeed involves base-level considerations about the delivery and acceptance of goods.
- It aligns with general principles regarding the fulfillment of obligations under specific conditions, particularly when external factors (like arson) affect the goods after an attempt at delivery has been made.

Therefore, the conclusion stands that the query entails a base-level factor related to the specification and delivery of goods and agrees with the root principle concerning the fulfillment of obligations under specified or implied terms.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the legal argument structure from the provided context step by step:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text is about Article 547, which discusses the right to cancel and the conditions under which this right can be exercised or extinguished.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule:** If no specific time period is given for exercising the right to cancel, the other party can set a reasonable time frame within which the holder of the right must decide whether to cancel or not.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition:** No period of time is specified for the exercise of the right to cancel.
- **Condition:** The other party issues a notice specifying a reasonable period of time for the holder of the right to cancel to make a decision.
- **Condition:** No notice of cancellation is received within the specified period.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence:** If no notice of cancellation is received within the specified period, the right to cancel is extinguished.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in the provided text.

### 6. Output Format
**Rule(s):** The rule states that if no time frame is given for exercising the cancellation right, the other party can specify a reasonable period.
**Condition(s):**
1. No specified period for cancellation.
2. Notice from the other party setting a reasonable time frame.
3. No cancellation notice received within this time frame.
**Legal Consequence(s):** The right to cancel is extinguished if no cancellation notice is received within the set period.
**Exception(s):** None mentioned.

Now, analyzing the query:
"If no period of time is specified for the exercise of the right to cancel, the right to cancel is extinguished if no notice of cancellation is received within that period, even though the other party has issued a notice of demand to the holder of the right to cancel, specifying a reasonable period of time, to the effect that the holder of the right to cancel is to give a definite answer as to whether the holder will cancel or not within that period of time."

The query essentially rephrases the conditions and consequence outlined in Article 547 but does so in a manner that might seem to slightly alter the emphasis on the role of the other party's notice. However, it fundamentally agrees with the rule and its application as described.

Given the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:
- The **Root Node (R1)** could be "The right to cancel is extinguished under certain conditions."
- An **Abstract Factor (A1)** might be "Specification of time periods for cancellation affects the right's exercise."
- A **Base-Level Factor (B1)** would then be "Receiving no cancellation notice within a specified period leads to the extinction of the cancellation right."

The query entails **B1** because it discusses the scenario where no notice of cancellation is received within a specified period, which directly relates to the base-level factor about the extinction of the cancellation right due to lack of action within a set time frame.

Moreover, the query **agrees with R1**, as both the original article and the query conclude that under the described conditions (no specified period initially, followed by a notice from the other party and no subsequent cancellation notice), the right to cancel is indeed extinguished. 

Thus, the final justification is:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

After careful reconsideration, this analysis holds because the query essentially restates the conditions under which the right to cancel is lost, aligning with both the base-level factor regarding the extinction of the right due to inaction within a set period and the root node's determination that such conditions lead to the loss of the cancellation right.

 Let's break down the legal argument structure step by step:

**Step 1: Read the Provided Text**
The given text is Article 133, which states:
(1) A juridical act subject to an impossible condition precedent is void.
(2) A juridical act subject to an impossible condition subsequent is an unconditional juridical act.

**Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)**
There are two rules stated in the text:
Rule 1: A juridical act with an impossible condition precedent is void.
Rule 2: A juridical act with an impossible condition subsequent becomes an unconditional juridical act.

**Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)**
The conditions for these rules are:
Condition 1: The juridical act has an impossible condition precedent.
Condition 2: The juridical act has an impossible condition subsequent.

**Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)**
The legal consequences of these conditions are:
Consequence 1: If Condition 1 is met, the juridical act is void.
Consequence 2: If Condition 2 is met, the juridical act becomes unconditional.

**Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)**
There are no explicit exceptions or limitations mentioned in the text.

**Output Format**

Rule(s):
- A juridical act with an impossible condition precedent is void.
- A juridical act with an impossible condition subsequent becomes an unconditional juridical act.

Condition(s):
- The juridical act has an impossible condition precedent.
- The juridical act has an impossible condition subsequent.

Legal Consequence(s):
- If the condition precedent is impossible, the act is void.
- If the condition subsequent is impossible, the act becomes unconditional.

Exception(s):
- None

Now, let's analyze the query: "Juristic act subject to a condition subsequent which is impossible is impossible shall be void."

Using the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:
- The Root Node (R) can be labeled as R1 for Rule 2: A juridical act with an impossible condition subsequent becomes an unconditional juridical act.
- An Abstract Factor could discuss the nature of conditions in juristic acts, but it's not necessary for this analysis.
- A Base-Level Factor (B1) could be: "A juristic act subject to a condition subsequent which is impossible should be void."

The query seems to consider a similar situation as B1, focusing on the outcome when a condition subsequent is impossible. However, the query concludes that such an act shall be void, which aligns with Rule 1 (impossible condition precedent) but not Rule 2 (impossible condition subsequent).

Given this analysis:
- The query entails B1 because both consider the scenario of an impossible condition affecting a juristic act.
- However, the query disagrees with R1 (the root related to Rule 2), as R1 states that an impossible condition subsequent makes the act unconditional, not void.

Therefore, the final justification is:
(query entails B1)
(query disagree R1)
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 query_entails(B1).query_disagree(R1).
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break it down step by step according to the provided instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The given text is Article 420 of a civil legal code, which discusses liquidated damages and their implications on contractual obligations. Specifically, it outlines that parties can agree on the amount of liquidated damages for failure to perform an obligation, that such agreements do not preclude requests for performance or cancellation rights, and that penalties are presumed to be liquidated damages.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The rules stated in Article 420 can be summarized as follows:
1. Parties have the freedom to agree on the amount of liquidated damages for non-performance.
2. Agreements on liquidated damages do not affect the right to request performance or to cancel the contract.
3. Penalties are generally considered to be liquidated damages.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which these rules apply include:
- When parties have agreed on the amount of liquidated damages for non-performance.
- When a party seeks to request performance or exercise their cancellation right despite an agreement on liquidated damages.
- The presumption that a penalty constitutes liquidated damages applies unless otherwise specified.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequences are:
- Parties can claim the agreed-upon amount of liquidated damages in case of non-performance.
- A party can still request performance or cancel the contract even if liquidated damages have been agreed upon.
- The presumption of a penalty being considered as liquidated damages stands unless proven otherwise.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
Exceptions or limitations include scenarios where:
- The agreement on liquidated damages might be deemed unfair or punitive, potentially altering its legal consequence.
- Specific contractual terms or legal precedents may override the general rules outlined in Article 420.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the analysis, we can summarize as follows:

Rule(s):
1. Parties can agree on liquidated damages for non-performance.
2. Such agreements do not preclude requests for performance or cancellation rights.
3. Penalties are presumed to be liquidated damages.

Condition(s):
1. Existence of an agreement on liquidated damages.
2. Attempt to request performance or exercise cancellation right despite such an agreement.

Legal Consequence(s):
1. Claiming agreed-upon liquidated damages.
2. Requesting performance or canceling the contract despite an agreement on liquidated damages.

Exception(s):
1. Unfair or punitive agreements.
2. Overriding contractual terms or legal precedents.

### Angelic Structure Formation Criteria
- **Root Node (R)**: The primary legal determination is that parties can agree on liquidated damages without affecting their right to request performance or cancel the contract.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships**: The context is contractual obligations, and the relationship is between the agreement on liquidated damages and the rights to performance or cancellation.
- **Node Naming Convention**:
  - Root Node: R1 (Agreement on Liquidated Damages Does Not Preclude Performance or Cancellation Rights)
  - Abstract Factors: A1 (Freedom to Agree on Liquidated Damages), A2 (Presumption of Penalties as Liquidated Damages)
  - Base-Level Factors: B1 (Existence of Agreement on Liquidated Damages), B2 (Attempt to Request Performance or Exercise Cancellation Right)

### Query Analysis
The query states, "Even if the parties agree on the amount of the liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation, the agreement shall not preclude the exercise of the cancellation right."
- **Justification**: The query directly aligns with Base-Level Factor B1 (Existence of Agreement on Liquidated Damages) and Root Node R1, as it discusses a scenario where an agreement on liquidated damages does not affect the right to cancel.
- **Entailment**: (query entails B1), because both consider the existence of an agreement on liquidated damages in relation to cancellation rights.
- **Agreement with Root Node**: (query agree R1), since both assert that an agreement on liquidated damages does not preclude the exercise of cancellation rights.

Upon careful reconsideration, this analysis holds true as it accurately reflects the relationship between agreements on liquidated damages and the preservation of contractual rights such as cancellation.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal context and query according to the specified steps.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text is carefully read and understood. It pertains to Article 120 of a civil legal code, discussing the conditions under which an act can be rescinded due to either a lack of qualified legal capacity or factors like mistake, fraud, or duress.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
Two general principles are identified:
1. An act that is voidable due to the person's qualified legal capacity can only be rescinded by the person with qualified legal capacity, their agent, successor, or someone authorized to give consent.
2. An act voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress can only be rescinded by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, their agent, or successor.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
Conditions include:
- The act being voidable on grounds of qualified legal capacity.
- The act being voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress.
- The presence of a person with qualified legal capacity or their representative in cases involving limited capacity.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that under specified conditions, an act can be rescinded by certain individuals as outlined in Article 120.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
No explicit exceptions are mentioned within the provided text snippet, but the query introduces a scenario involving an adult who later becomes subject to guardianship, potentially altering the applicability of the rule regarding qualified legal capacity.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the structured format requirement:
- **Rule(s):** Acts voidable due to lack of qualified legal capacity or mistake/fraud/duress can be rescinded under specific conditions.
- **Condition(s):** Qualified legal capacity issues, mistake, fraud, duress, and representation by authorized individuals.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** Rescission of the act by specified parties.
- **Exception(s):** None explicitly stated in Article 120, but queries may introduce special cases like guardianship.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
- **Root Node (R1):** The general principle that acts can be rescinded under certain conditions related to legal capacity or mistake/fraud/duress.
- **Abstract Factors:** Issues of qualified legal capacity and situations involving mistake, fraud, or duress.
- **Base-Level Factors:** Specific scenarios like an adult becoming subject to guardianship after concluding a contract.

### Justification
The query introduces a scenario where an adult concludes a contract and later becomes subject to guardianship. This scenario involves a base-level factor (B1) concerning the change in legal capacity status post-contract conclusion.
- **(query entails B1):** The query directly addresses a situation involving a change in legal status, which is a specific scenario or base-level factor related to the general principles outlined.

Considering the root node R1, which pertains to the rescission of acts due to issues like qualified legal capacity:
- **(query agree R1):** The query essentially agrees with the principle that changes in legal capacity (like becoming subject to guardianship) can impact the validity or enforceability of contracts concluded prior to such a change, thus potentially aligning with the root node's general principle regarding rescission due to qualified legal capacity issues.

Upon re-justification, considering the specifics of Article 120 and the query's focus on the guardian's ability to rescind a contract due to grounds for commencement of guardianship (which implies a lack of qualified legal capacity at the time of the contract), it seems there is an alignment with the principles outlined in Article 120 regarding rescission based on legal capacity issues. 

Thus, the conclusion remains that:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

This justification process ensures a careful analysis of both the provided legal context and the query's specific scenario to determine how they interact within the framework of Article 120's principles regarding the rescission of acts.

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process into steps.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses a specific scenario related to guarantees and obligations, focusing on the rights and responsibilities of a guarantor when the principal obligor fails to notify them about fulfilling their obligations.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle here is that if a guarantor acts in good faith to fulfill an obligation because the principal obligor failed to inform them that the obligation had already been met, the guarantor's action can be considered valid under certain conditions.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- The guarantor must have given the guarantee at the request of the principal obligor.
- The guarantor acts in good faith to extinguish the obligation due to the principal obligor's failure to notify them about their performance of an act for extinguishment of obligation.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
If these conditions are met, the guarantor may deem their own act for extinguishing the obligation as valid.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
The query introduces a scenario where the guarantee was given without the request of the principal obligor. This could be seen as an exception to the general rule, potentially altering the applicability of the guarantor's actions being deemed valid.

### Output Format

- **Rule(s):** A guarantor's act in good faith to fulfill an obligation can be considered valid if done due to lack of notification from the principal obligor.
- **Condition(s):** 
  - The guarantee was given at the request of the principal obligor.
  - The guarantor acted due to not being informed about the principal obligor's fulfillment of the obligation.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The guarantor's act can be deemed valid under these conditions.
- **Exception(s):** Scenarios where the guarantee was given without the principal obligor's request may alter the applicability of this rule.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria

Given the query and the context, let's analyze if it entails base-level factors or agrees/disagrees with the root node (R1).

- **Root Node (R1):** The guarantor's act in good faith to fulfill an obligation can be valid if the principal obligor failed to notify them about fulfilling their obligations.
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** A scenario where a guarantee was given without the request of the principal obligor, and the guarantor performs the obligation without knowing it has been fulfilled by the principal obligor.

### Justification

- The query does indeed consider a specific scenario that can be seen as a base-level factor because it discusses a particular situation related to guarantees and obligations. **(query entails B1)**
- However, upon closer inspection, the query seems to agree with the principle outlined in R1. Both the original rule and the query suggest that if a guarantor acts without knowledge of the principal obligor's fulfillment (due to lack of notification or other reasons), their action can be considered valid under certain conditions. The key difference lies in whether the guarantee was given at the request of the principal obligor, but the core principle of acting in good faith due to lack of information aligns. **(query agree R1)**

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of legal interpretations and the specific wording of both the rule and the query, it's clear that while there are similarities, the introduction of a guarantee given without request introduces a complexity not directly addressed by the original rule as stated. However, the core principle of validity based on good faith actions due to lack of notification seems to be a common thread. Thus, the initial assessment of agreement between the query and R1 stands, with an understanding that legal applications can depend heavily on specific details and interpretations of conditions and exceptions.

Therefore, the output is:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, we'll break down the process into steps as outlined:

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text provided is about Article 605, which states that a lease of immovables, when registered, may be duly asserted against a third party such as a person that subsequently acquires real rights with respect to the immovables. The query states that the building lease, when registered, shall also be effective against a person who subsequently acquires real rights with respect to the building, even if the building is not delivered.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule**: A registered lease of immovables (or buildings) can be asserted against third parties who acquire real rights over these properties after registration.
  
### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition**: The lease must be registered.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence**: Once a lease is registered, it can be asserted against subsequent acquirers of real rights over the immovable properties.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- There are no explicitly stated exceptions in the given text.

### Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: A registered lease of immovables (or buildings) can be asserted against third parties who acquire real rights over these properties after registration.
- **Condition(s)**: The lease must be registered.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**: Once a lease is registered, it can be asserted against subsequent acquirers of real rights over the immovable properties.
- **Exception(s)**: None stated.

### Angelic Structure Formation Criteria Analysis
The query and the base-level factor consider similar scenarios regarding the registration of leases and their effectiveness against third parties acquiring real rights. The query specifically mentions a scenario where the building is not delivered, which aligns with considering the effectiveness of a registered lease in various situations.

Given this analysis:
- **(query entails B1)**: Yes, because both the query and the base-level factor consider the scenario of a registered lease being effective against subsequent acquirers of real rights.
  
Considering the most comparable root (R1) which is about asserting a registered lease against third parties:
- **(query agree R1)**: Yes, because both the original text and the query agree that a registered lease can be asserted against those who subsequently acquire real rights over the properties in question.

Upon re-justification, these conclusions hold as the query essentially asks if a registered building lease is effective against subsequent acquirers even without delivery of the building, aligning with the principle outlined in Article 605 regarding the assertion of registered leases against third parties. 

Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text provided is Article 482, which discusses a situation where a performer concludes a contract with an obligee to extinguish an obligation by making a different type of payment or delivery than what was originally agreed upon. The query then raises a scenario regarding the obligee's ability to perform an obligation by assigning a claim to a third party against the will of the obligor.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The rule stated in Article 482 can be summarized as follows:
- If a performer and an obligee agree on an alternative payment or delivery method, this alternative has the same effect as the original obligation's performance.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which this rule applies include:
- A performer must have the right to perform the obligation.
- The performer and the obligee must conclude a contract agreeing on an alternative form of payment or delivery.
- The performer must make the agreed-upon alternative payment or delivery.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that the alternative payment or delivery has the same effect as performing the original obligation, thereby extinguishing it.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicitly stated exceptions in Article 482 regarding the scenario described. However, the query introduces a situation where an obligee attempts to perform an obligation by assigning a claim to a third party against the will of the obligor, which may imply a limitation or exception based on the parties' agreement and consent.

### 6. Output Format
Given the analysis:
- Rule(s): Alternative payment or delivery agreed upon by the performer and obligee has the same effect as the original performance.
- Condition(s): The existence of an agreement between the performer and obligee for alternative payment or delivery, and the performer's right to perform the obligation.
- Legal Consequence(s): The obligation is extinguished with the same effect as if it were performed originally.
- Exception(s): None explicitly stated in Article 482 regarding consent and assignment against a party's will.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Based on the provided criteria:
- Root Node (R1) could be "Alternative Payment/Delivery Extends Obligation Performance."
- Abstract Factor (A1) might involve "Contractual Agreements Altering Original Terms."
- Base-Level Factor (B1) could include "Assignment of Claims Against the Will of the Obligor."

### Query Analysis
The query entails a Base-Level Factor because it discusses a specific scenario involving the assignment of claims, which relates to contractual agreements and obligations. Therefore: **(query entails B1)**.

Regarding agreement with the root:
- The root (R1) suggests that alternative payments or deliveries can effectively extinguish an obligation if agreed upon.
- The query implies a situation where consent (or lack thereof) from the obligor might affect such agreements, potentially disagreeing with the straightforward application of R1 in scenarios involving assignment against the will of the obligor. Therefore: **(query disagree R1)**.

After rejustification, considering the nuances of contractual law and the specifics of obligation performance, consent, and assignment, the initial analysis holds as it reflects a careful consideration of how the query's scenario intersects with but also challenges the straightforward application of Article 482 in cases where all parties' consent is not uniformly present.

 To address the given task, we'll break down the process into steps as instructed.


## Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The provided text is Article 441, which discusses joint and several obligations among obligors. Specifically, it mentions that circumstances affecting one obligor do not affect others unless specified otherwise or if the obligee and another obligor agree differently.


## Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle here is that in cases of joint and several obligations, an event or circumstance affecting one obligor does not automatically affect the obligations of other joint and several obligors.


## Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which this rule applies include:
- The existence of a joint and several obligation.
- Specific exceptions mentioned in Articles 438, Article 439, paragraph (1), and the preceding article do not apply.
- Unless the obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors manifest a different intention.


## Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that each joint and several obligor remains responsible for the full obligation unless an exception applies or there's a different agreement between the obligee and one of the obligors.


## Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
Exceptions include:
- Cases prescribed in Articles 438, Article 439, paragraph (1), and the preceding article.
- Situations where the obligee and one of the joint and several obligors agree to a different effect regarding the other obligors.


## Step 6: Output Format
Given the structured format requirement:

Rule(s):
- In joint and several obligations, an event affecting one obligor does not affect others unless specified otherwise.

Condition(s):
- Existence of a joint and several obligation.
- Specific exceptions do not apply.
- Different intention by the obligee and another obligor.

Legal Consequence(s):
- Each obligor remains responsible for the full obligation unless an exception applies or there's a different agreement.

Exception(s):
- Cases prescribed in specific articles.
- Different agreements between the obligee and one of the obligors.


## Justification of Query Entailment
The query discusses B, C, and D having a joint and several obligation to A, with each bearing equally proportionate obligations. It states that even if prescription is completed with respect to B, C and D shall still bear a joint and several obligation of 3 million yen to A.

Given the context, this scenario considers the completion of prescription as an event affecting one obligor (B) but questions its effect on others (C and D). This situation aligns with the conditions and principles outlined in Article 441, particularly focusing on how events or circumstances (like the completion of prescription) affecting one joint and several obligor impact the obligations of others.

Thus, the query entails a Base-Level Factor considering the evidence in a similar situation or scenario regarding joint and several obligations.


## Agreement/Disagreement with Root
The root principle (R1) states that in cases of joint and several obligations, an event affecting one obligor does not automatically affect the obligations of other joint and several obligors. The query seems to agree with this principle by implying that despite the completion of prescription for B, C and D are still obligated, which suggests that the event (completion of prescription) affecting B does not inherently absolve C and D of their obligations.


The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B1), (query agree R1)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text given includes Article 519, which states that if an obligee manifests the intention to release an obligor from an obligation, the obligee's claim is extinguished. The query expands on this concept by specifying that in cases where an obligee manifests his/her intention to release an obligation to the obligor, such obligation shall be extinguished when the obligor manifests his/her intention to receive the benefit of the release.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle here is:
- If an obligee intends to release an obligor from an obligation, this can lead to the extinction of the obligee's claim.
- For the obligation to be extinguished, both parties must manifest their intentions: the obligee to release and the obligor to accept the release.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions are:
- The obligee must manifest an intention to release the obligor from the obligation.
- The obligor must manifest an intention to receive the benefit of this release for the obligation to be extinguished.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that upon both conditions being met, the obligation is extinguished, and consequently, the obligee's claim against the obligor is also extinguished.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicit exceptions or limitations provided in the text regarding when this rule would not apply. The text presents a straightforward scenario without mentioning any special cases that might alter the outcome.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** An obligee's intention to release an obligor from an obligation can lead to the extinction of the claim if both parties agree.
- **Condition(s):**
  - The obligee must intend to release the obligor.
  - The obligor must accept the release.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The obligation and consequently the obligee's claim are extinguished upon mutual agreement.
- **Exception(s):** None explicitly stated.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria Analysis
Given the query and the base-level factors identified (B1: Mutual intention to release and accept leads to obligation extinction), we can analyze:
- The query entails a Base-Level Factor because it considers evidence in a similar situation or scenario where mutual intentions lead to obligation extinction. **(query entails B1)**
- Comparing the query with the root node (R1: Obligation is extinguished when obligee intends to release and obligor accepts), we see that they agree on the same verdict in comparable situations. The query specifies a condition (obligor's acceptance) that aligns with the principle of mutual intention leading to obligation extinction. **(query agrees R1)**

After careful consideration, the analysis holds true: the query aligns with the base-level factor considering mutual intentions for obligation extinction and agrees with the root node on the conditions and consequences of such an action.

**Final Output:**
- (query entails B1)
- (query agrees R1)
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 query_entails(B1).query_agrees(R1).
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's break down the information step by step according to the instructions provided.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes Article 28 and Article 103, which discuss the authority of an administrator in managing the property of an absentee. Article 28 mentions that if an act exceeds the administrator's authority as defined in Article 103, permission from the family court is required. Article 103 outlines the specific acts an agent (or administrator) with undefined authority can perform: acts of preservation and acts that use or improve a thing or right without changing its nature.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
1. **Rule**: An administrator must obtain permission from the family court to perform any act exceeding their authority as defined in Article 103.
2. **Rule**: An agent with no specifically defined authority can only perform acts of preservation and acts that use or improve a thing or right without changing its nature.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- The conditions under which these rules apply include situations where an administrator needs to exceed their given authority, especially when it's unclear if the absentee is dead or alive.
- The agent's actions are limited by Article 103 unless they have specific authority.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- If an administrator performs an act without obtaining necessary permission when required, the legal consequence could include invalidation of the act or legal repercussions.
- An agent performing acts within their defined authority does not need additional permission and can legally manage the property accordingly.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- An exception might be if the absentee's status (dead or alive) is clarified, which could alter the administrator's authority.
- Another potential exception is when all parties involved agree to certain actions, potentially negating the need for court permission.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the structured analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: 
  1. An administrator needs family court permission for acts beyond Article 103 authority.
  2. Agents can perform preservation and improvement acts within defined limits.
- **Condition(s)**: Acts exceeding given authority; unclear status of absentee.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**: Permission required for validity; potential legal repercussions without permission.
- **Exception(s)**: Clarification of absentee's status; agreement among parties.

### Justification
Given the query "In cases where A is one of the joint heirs of deceased F, B doesn't need to obtain the permission of a family court when dividing inherited F's property by agreement between the other joint heirs as an agent of A," we can analyze its relationship with the base-level factors and root nodes.

- The query seems to consider a scenario where there is an agreement among parties (in this case, the other joint heirs), which could be seen as a **Base-Level Factor** related to exceptions or special cases.
- This scenario aligns with potential exceptions to the general rule requiring court permission for acts beyond specified authority, particularly when all relevant parties agree on a course of action.

Thus, considering the evidence and similar situation or scenario:
- (query entails B1), because it involves an agreement among parties which is akin to a base-level factor related to exceptions.
- Given that there's an implication of agreement negating the need for court permission in specific circumstances, this could be seen as aligning with a root node that considers exceptions based on mutual agreements or clearances:
  - (query agree R1), assuming R1 represents the rule allowing for certain actions without court permission under specific conditions like mutual agreement.

After careful reconsideration, it's crucial to note that the query's specifics about dividing inherited property by agreement might indeed touch upon nuances of inheritance law and administrative permissions not fully detailed in the provided articles. However, based on the information given:
- The query does seem to align with exceptions or special cases where court permission is not required due to agreements among parties.
- Therefore, it could be argued that the query agrees with a root node representing rules about administrative actions under specific conditions of agreement or clarity regarding the absentee's status.

 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's break down the information according to the provided instructions.


## Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses false manifestations of intention in a legal context, specifically Article 94(1) and (2), which address situations where a person makes a false manifestation of intention in collusion with another and the implications for third parties.


## Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** A false manifestation of intention made by a person in collusion with another is void.
- **Rule 2:** The nullity of such a manifestation cannot be asserted against a third party who is in good faith.


## Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** The false manifestation must be made in collusion between two parties.
- **Condition 2:** For the nullity not to be asserted, there must be a third party involved who is in good faith.


## Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence 1:** The agreement or contract based on the false manifestation is void.
- **Consequence 2:** A third party in good faith cannot have the nullity of the original agreement asserted against them.


## Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1:** If a third party is not in good faith, the nullity can be asserted against them.
 

## Step 6: Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** 
  - A false manifestation of intention made by a person in collusion with another is void.
  - The nullity of such a manifestation cannot be asserted against a third party who is in good faith.
- **Condition(s):**
  - The manifestation must be false and made in collusion.
  - The involvement of a third party in good faith.
- **Legal Consequence(s):**
  - The agreement based on the false manifestation is void.
  - A third party in good faith is protected from having the nullity asserted against them.
- **Exception(s):**
  - If a third party knows about the falsification, they may not be considered in good faith.


Now, addressing the query:
- The scenario involves A and B conspiring to sell Land X, which is then sold to C (who knows of the falsification) and eventually to D. 
- **Query Analysis:** Given that C knows of the falsification but D does not, the question revolves around whether A can assert the invalidity against D.
- **ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:**
  - **Root Node (R):** The legality of asserting nullity against a third party in good faith.
  - **Abstract Factors:** Good faith of parties involved, knowledge of falsification.
  - **Base-Level Factors:** Specific actions and knowledge of each party (A, B, C, D).
- **Node Naming Convention:**
  - Let R1 be the root node regarding asserting nullity against third parties in good faith.
  - A1 could represent the abstract factor of "good faith," and B1 could represent a base-level factor such as "C's knowledge of falsification."


## Justification:
- The query entails **B1** (knowledge of C about the falsification affecting the chain of transactions).
- Considering R1, which focuses on the good faith of third parties in asserting nullity, and comparing it with the scenario where D is the final buyer without knowledge of the initial falsification between A and B:
  - The query **disagrees** with R1 because R1 suggests protection for third parties in good faith (like D), implying that A should not be able to assert the invalidity against D due to D's lack of knowledge about the collusion.


The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B1), (query disagree R1)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Read the Provided Text:
The text is Article 137, which discusses when an obligor may not assert the benefit of a time stipulation. The conditions include the obligor becoming subject to bankruptcy proceedings, losing, damaging, or diminishing security, or failing to provide security when obligated to do so.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle):
The general principle is that an obligor cannot assert the benefit of a time stipulation under certain conditions related to their financial or legal status and their handling of security.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability):
- The obligor has become subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
- The obligor has lost, damaged, or diminished the security.
- The obligor fails to provide security when they have an obligation to do so.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome):
The legal consequence is that the obligor cannot assert the benefit of a time stipulation, meaning they cannot delay fulfilling their obligations based on time-related clauses in their agreement.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases):
There are no explicitly stated exceptions or limitations in the provided text. The conditions listed are straightforward and do not include phrases like "unless" or "except for," which typically introduce exceptions.

### 6. Output Format:
**Rule(s):** An obligor cannot assert the benefit of a time stipulation under specific conditions.
**Condition(s):**
1. Becoming subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
2. Losing, damaging, or diminishing security.
3. Failing to provide required security.
**Legal Consequence(s):** The obligor loses the right to delay fulfilling their obligations based on time-related clauses.
**Exception(s):** None stated.

Given the query: "In cases where the obligor of monetary debt has the obligation to provide security, if the security is not provided, the obligor cannot assert the benefit of the time."

This query directly relates to one of the conditions listed in Article 137, specifically condition (iii) regarding failing to provide security when obligated to do so. Therefore, it can be said that **(query entails B1)**, where B1 represents the base-level factor of failing to provide required security.

Furthermore, since both the query and the root node (R1) of our analysis conclude that an obligor cannot assert the benefit of a time stipulation when they fail to provide required security, it can be concluded that **(query agree R1)**. This agreement is based on the comparable situation where an obligor's failure to provide security directly results in their inability to assert the benefit of a time stipulation.

After re-justification, the conclusion remains that the query entails a base-level factor (B1) related to failing to provide security and agrees with the root node (R1) regarding the legal consequence of such an action.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined:

1. **Read the Provided Text**: The text provided includes a civil legal article (Article 593-2) and a query related to a contract of loan for use between two parties, A and B.

2. **Identify the Rule (General Principle)**: 
   - The lender may cancel the contract until the borrower receives the borrowed thing.
   - There's an exception for loans for use made in writing.

3. **Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)**:
   - The contract can be canceled by the lender before the borrower receives the borrowed item.
   - The contract is not made in writing, which applies to loans for use.

4. **Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)**:
   - If the conditions are met, the lender may cancel the contract.

5. **Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)**:
   - Loans for use made in writing do not allow the lender to cancel the contract once it's agreed upon.

Given this analysis, we can summarize the legal argument structure as follows:

**Rule(s)**: The lender may cancel a loan contract before the borrower receives the item. However, loans for use in writing are an exception.
**Condition(s)**: The contract must not be made in writing to allow cancellation by the lender at any time until delivery.
**Legal Consequence(s)**: The lender can cancel the contract if conditions are met.
**Exception(s)**: Loans for use that are made in writing cannot be canceled.

Now, considering the query and applying it to the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:

- **Root Node (R)**: The primary legal determination here revolves around the cancellation of a loan contract based on its terms and whether it's made in writing.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships**: We have defined nodes for rules, conditions, consequences, and exceptions. The query relates to these by questioning the applicability of cancellation in a specific scenario (loan for use not made in writing).

The query mentions a scenario where A allows B to use building X through a contract of loan for use that is not made in writing. It then states that A may cancel the contract at any time until building X is delivered to B.

Given this, we can identify that:
- The query **entails Base-Level Factor** because it discusses a specific situation (a loan for use not made in writing) similar to what's outlined in our conditions.
- Considering the root node (the general principle about cancellation), the query seems to align with the rule that allows cancellation before delivery if not made in writing. Therefore, **(query agrees R1)**.

Upon rejustification:
- The query directly references a scenario where the contract is not in writing, which matches our condition for allowing cancellation.
- It concludes that A can cancel at any time until delivery, which aligns with the legal consequence outlined if conditions are met.

Therefore, the conclusion stands as initially justified: **(query entails B1)** and **(query agrees R1)**.

 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal article context and the query according to the specified steps.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses defects in acts of agency, specifically how the validity of a manifestation of intention by an agent or another party is influenced by factors like absence of intention, mistake, fraud, duress, or knowledge/negligence regarding particular circumstances. It also outlines rules concerning what a principal may assert about an agent's knowledge when the agent performs a specific juridical act.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
1. The validity of manifestations of intention in agency relationships can be influenced by various factors including absence of intention, mistake, fraud, duress, or knowledge/negligence of particular circumstances.
2. A principal may not assert that an agent did not know of a particular circumstance if the principal knew or should have known about it due to negligence.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
1. The conditions under which these rules apply include situations where the validity of a manifestation of intention is in question, specifically regarding knowledge or negligence of particular circumstances.
2. For the second rule, the condition is that the agent has been entrusted with performing a specific juridical act.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
1. The legal consequence for the first rule is that the validity of the manifestation of intention may be affected based on the presence or absence of influencing factors.
2. For the second rule, if the principal knew or should have known about a circumstance due to negligence, they cannot later claim the agent did not know about it.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
The text does not explicitly outline exceptions but provides specific conditions under which the rules apply, implying that outside these conditions, different legal consequences might follow.

### Output Format
Given the structured analysis:
- **Rule(s):** 
  - The validity of manifestations of intention in agency can be influenced by several factors.
  - A principal cannot assert an agent's lack of knowledge if the principal knew or should have known due to negligence.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Situations where the validity of a manifestation of intention is questioned due to influencing factors.
  - The agent performs a specific juridical act entrusted by the principal.
- **Legal Consequence(s):**
  - The validity of the manifestation may be affected.
  - The principal cannot claim the agent's ignorance if they knew or should have known about a circumstance.
- **Exception(s):** 
  - None explicitly stated, but implied through specific conditions.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
For simplicity, let's label the root node related to the query as R1 (principal's assertion about agent's knowledge) and base-level factors as B1 (agent performing act according to instructions), A1 (absence of intention or influencing factors).

### Query Analysis
The query suggests that a principal may not assert an agent did not know of a particular circumstance only if the agent performed the act in accordance with the principal's instructions. This introduces a condition (acting according to instructions) not explicitly stated in the original text as a limitation on the principal's assertion.

- **(query entails B1):** The query does indeed consider a base-level factor (B1), which is whether the agent performed the act according to the principal's instructions, a scenario similar to what the original rule discusses.
  
Given this analysis:
- **(query agree R1):** The query actually seems to introduce an additional condition rather than directly agreeing or disagreeing with the root node's verdict. However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen as attempting to clarify or add specificity to when a principal may not assert an agent's lack of knowledge, potentially narrowing down the applicability of R1 under specific conditions (acting according to instructions).

Upon re-justification:
- The query does indeed introduce a condition that could be considered an attempt to specify further the original rule regarding a principal's assertions about an agent's knowledge. However, this introduction of "only if the agent performed that act in accordance with the instructions" might not directly align with or alter the core verdict presented by R1 but rather seeks to add a condition to its applicability.

Therefore, considering the format requirements and the analysis provided:
- **(query entails B1):** Yes, as it discusses a scenario (agent performing according to instructions) that can be considered a base-level factor.
- The agreement or disagreement with R1 depends on interpreting the query as either clarifying the rule's applicability under specific conditions or introducing an exception. However, given the structure and the aim for clarity:
- **(query disagree R1):** This might be more accurate if we consider that the query introduces a condition ("only if") not originally stated in the rule regarding when a principal may assert an agent's knowledge, potentially narrowing its application in a way that could be seen as disagreed upon based on additional specificity.
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 query_entails_B1: Yes.query_agree_R1: No.query_disagree_R1: Yes.
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, we first need to break down the provided legal article context and then analyze the query in light of this context, following the specified steps.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses Article 506, which pertains to set-offs. It states that set-offs are effected through one party's manifestation of intention to the other, without any conditions or time limits added to this manifestation. The effectiveness of this manifestation is retroactive to when both parties' obligations became eligible for set-off.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle here is that a set-off between two parties is achieved through a clear expression of intention by one party to the other, and this expression cannot include any conditions or time limits.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The condition for applying this rule is that both parties must have obligations eligible for set-off. There's also an implicit condition that the manifestation of intention must be clear and without additional stipulations like conditions or time limits.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence of a valid manifestation of intention for set-off is that it becomes effective retroactively to the point in time when both parties' obligations were eligible for set-off, thereby adjusting their mutual obligations accordingly.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in the provided text. However, the prohibition on adding conditions or time limits to the manifestation of intention can be seen as a limitation on how set-offs can be initiated.

### Structured Output
- **Rule(s):** A set-off is achieved through a party's clear manifestation of intention without conditions or time limits.
- **Condition(s):** Both parties must have obligations eligible for set-off, and the manifestation must be without conditions or time limits.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The set-off becomes effective retroactively to when both parties' obligations were eligible.
- **Exception(s):** None explicitly stated.

### Analysis of Query
The query states: "A time limit can be added to the manifestation of intention of offset, but conditions cannot be added." This directly contradicts the rule stated in Article 506, which explicitly prohibits adding either conditions or time limits to the manifestation of intention for a set-off.

### Justification
- The query **disagrees** with the root (R1), as it suggests that adding a time limit is permissible, contrary to what Article 506 states.
- Considering the evidence and scenario presented by Article 506, the query does **not entail** the base-level factor (B1) that represents the rule's conditions because it misinterprets the rule regarding time limits.

### Final Justification
Upon careful consideration, the initial analysis stands. The query contradicts the rule as stated in Article 506, specifically by suggesting that adding a time limit to the manifestation of intention is acceptable, which directly opposes the article's stipulation. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the query **disagrees** with the root (R1) and does **not entail** the base-level factor accurately representing the conditions for set-off as per Article 506.

Output:
- (query disagree R1)
- (query entails B1 is not applicable due to disagreement on key rule aspect)

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Read the Provided Text:
The text discusses the grounds for extinction of possessory rights under Article 203, which states that possessory rights are extinguished when the possessor renounces the intention to possess or loses possession of the thing, unless the possessor files an action for recovery of possession.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle):
The general principle here is that possessory rights cease to exist under certain conditions, primarily the loss of possession or the renunciation of the intention to possess.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability):
- The possessor must either renounce their intention to possess.
- The possessor loses possession of the thing.
- An exception applies if the possessor files an action for recovery of possession.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome):
The legal consequence is the extinction of possessory rights, meaning the person no longer has a legal right to possess the item in question.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases):
An exception exists if the possessor files an action for recovery of possession. This prevents the automatic extinction of their possessory rights despite losing physical possession.

### 6. Output Format:
#### Rule(s):
- Possessory rights are extinguished when the possessor loses the intention to possess or loses possession.
#### Condition(s):
- Loss of intention to possess.
- Physical loss of possession.
- Filing an action for recovery of possession (as an exception).
#### Legal Consequence(s):
- Extinction of possessory rights.
#### Exception(s):
- If the possessor files an action for recovery of possession, their rights are not extinguished despite physical loss of possession.

Given the query: "B exercises a right of retention against movable X owned by A. If C steals X from B, B may not demand C to return X by an action for recovery of possession."

To justify whether this query entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root node:

- **Entails Base-Level Factor:** The scenario described involves specific circumstances (B's right of retention, theft by C) that directly relate to conditions affecting possessory rights. Thus, it considers evidence in a similar situation or scenario related to possessory rights and their extinction. So, **(query entails B1)**.
  
- **Agreement with Root Node:** The root node concerns the general principle that possessory rights are extinguished upon loss of possession unless an action for recovery is filed. The query suggests B cannot demand return by an action for recovery of possession after C steals X, which seems to disagree with the exception provided in Article 203, as it implies B should be able to file such an action to maintain their possessory rights despite physical loss. Thus, **(query disagrees R1)**.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of legal terminology and the specifics of possessory rights, retention, and recovery actions:
- The initial analysis stands because the query's scenario directly involves a situation where possessory rights are at stake due to theft (a form of loss of possession).
- However, the disagreement with R1 might stem from a misunderstanding of how "right of retention" interacts with "action for recovery of possession." If B's right of retention is akin to a possessory right, then filing an action for recovery should indeed be an option to prevent extinction of those rights, aligning more closely with R1 than initially thought.

Given this deeper analysis and the specific legal context provided:
- **Revised Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query still directly pertains to scenarios involving possessory rights. So, **(query entails B1)** remains accurate.
- **Revised Agreement with Root Node:** Upon closer examination, considering the intention behind Article 203 and typical legal principles regarding possession and recovery actions, it seems there might have been an oversight in interpreting how B's situation aligns with R1. If we strictly follow the provided legal article without additional assumptions about "right of retention" and its implications, then the query actually **(disagrees R1)** due to suggesting B cannot demand return via an action for recovery of possession after theft, contrary to what Article 203 suggests should be possible (filing an action for recovery as an exception to extinction).

Thus, the final output considering all instructions and clarifications is:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagrees R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal context and query step by step according to the instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text provided discusses "Potestative Conditions" within a civil legal context. Specifically, Article 134 states that a juridical act subject to a condition precedent is void if the condition is dependent only upon the intention of the obligor. The query involves A concluding a gift agreement with B, where A agrees to give B 100,000 yen if A feels inclined to do so.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The rule stated in Article 134 can be summarized as follows:
- **Rule**: A juridical act (such as a contract or agreement) is considered void if its fulfillment depends solely on the whim or intention of one party (the obligor).

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The condition under which this rule applies can be summarized as:
- **Condition**: The juridical act must be subject to a condition precedent that is dependent only upon the intention of the obligor.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence or outcome when this condition is met is:
- **Legal Consequence**: The juridical act is void, meaning it has no legal effect and is not enforceable.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in the provided text. However, it's understood that if a condition is not solely dependent on the obligor's intention, this rule may not apply.

### Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: A juridical act is void if its fulfillment depends solely on the whim or intention of one party.
- **Condition(s)**: The act must be subject to a condition precedent dependent only upon the obligor's intention.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**: The act is considered void and not legally enforceable.
- **Exception(s)**: None explicitly stated.

### Angelic Structure Formation Criteria
For simplicity, let's denote:
- **R1**: The root node representing Article 134's rule that a juridical act dependent solely on the obligor's intention is void.
- **B1**: A base-level factor considering scenarios where agreements are made contingent upon one party's whim or intention.

### Query Analysis
The query involves A agreeing to give B 100,000 yen if A feels inclined to do so. This scenario directly aligns with the condition precedent being dependent on the obligor's (A's) intention.

- **(query entails B1)**: Yes, because both the query and B1 consider scenarios where the fulfillment of an agreement is contingent upon one party's feelings or intentions.
  
Given that the query entails B1, we then assess whether the query agrees or disagrees with R1 in a comparable situation. 

- **(query disagree R1)**: The query suggests that if B demands the 100,000 yen, A may not refuse to pay, which contradicts the rule stated by Article 134 and represented by R1. According to R1 (and thus Article 134), such an agreement would be void because it's dependent solely on A's inclination.

Upon re-justification, considering the specifics of the query and the legal principle outlined in Article 134:
- The original assessment stands; the scenario presented in the query directly involves a condition precedent that is dependent solely upon the obligor's (A's) intention.
- Therefore, according to Article 134, such an agreement would indeed be considered void because it meets the criteria of being contingent on the obligor's whim.

However, the phrasing of the query seems to imply a misunderstanding or misapplication of Article 134's principle in practice. In law, if an agreement is truly contingent upon one party's feeling inclined to fulfill it, it would not be legally enforceable due to its potestative nature, as outlined in Article 134.

Thus, the final justification aligns with the initial assessment:
- **(query entails B1)**: The query and B1 consider similar scenarios of agreements contingent on one party's intention.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The outcome suggested by the query (A cannot refuse to pay if B demands) contradicts the principle that such an agreement would be void due to its dependency solely on A's inclination, as per Article 134 and represented by R1.

 To address the task given, let's break down the provided legal context step by step according to the instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses the conditions under which a declaration of disappearance can be rescinded and the implications of such a rescission on property acquired due to the initial declaration.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
There are two main rules:
1. A declaration of disappearance must be rescinded if proof is received that the missing person is alive or died at a different time than initially stated.
2. The rescission of the declaration does not affect acts performed in good faith before the rescission.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions include:
- Receipt of proof that the missing person is alive or that the person died at a time different from what was initially stated.
- Acts must have been performed in good faith after the declaration of disappearance but before its rescission.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequences are:
- The declaration of disappearance is rescinded upon proof of the missing person's status.
- A person who acquired property due to the declaration loses rights to that property but only has to return it to the extent they are currently enriched.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
The exception mentioned is:
- Despite losing rights to the property, the person who acquired it due to the declaration of disappearance only needs to return the property to the extent they are still enriched by it.

### Output Format
Given the instructions for output format:

Rule(s):
1. A declaration of disappearance can be rescinded with proof of the missing person's actual status.
2. Acts done in good faith before rescission remain valid.

Condition(s):
- Proof that the missing person is alive or died at a different time.
- Good faith actions after declaration but before rescission.

Legal Consequence(s):
- Rescission of the declaration of disappearance.
- Loss of property rights with an obligation to return property to the extent still enriched.

Exception(s):
- The obligation to return property is limited to the current enrichment level.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the context, we can identify:
- **Root Node (R1)**: Rescission of a declaration of disappearance based on new evidence.
- **Abstract Factors**: Good faith actions, property rights.
- **Base-Level Factors (B1)**: Obligation to return acquired property only to the extent of current enrichment.

### Query Analysis
The query states that a person who has acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance must return the full amount of benefits received from the acquisition of the property, even if they acted in good faith regarding the survival of the missing person. This directly contradicts the base-level factor **B1**, which specifies that the obligation to return property is limited to the extent of current enrichment.

### Entailment and Agreement
- The query entails a Base-Level Factor because it discusses the scenario of returning acquired property, similar to **B1**.
- However, the query disagrees with the root node **R1**'s implication on how property should be returned after the rescission of a declaration of disappearance. **R1**, through its legal consequences and exceptions, suggests a return based on current enrichment, not necessarily the full amount of benefits received.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the instructions provided:

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text is Article 453, which discusses the conditions under which a guarantor can exercise the right of defense of obligor's solvency. It states that even after the obligee has made a demand to the principal obligor, the obligee must first execute on the property of the principal obligor if the guarantor proves that the principal obligor has the financial resources to pay the obligation and that the execution can be easily performed.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle or rule stated in the text can be summarized as follows:
- **Rule**: A guarantor can require an obligee to first execute on the property of the principal obligor under certain conditions, primarily related to the principal obligor's ability to pay and the ease of execution.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which this rule applies are:
- **Condition 1**: The guarantor must prove that the principal obligor has the financial resources to pay the obligation.
- **Condition 2**: The guarantor must also prove that the execution on the principal obligor's property can be easily performed.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence or outcome of meeting these conditions is:
- **Legal Consequence**: The obligee must first execute on the property of the principal obligor before taking any action against the guarantor.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicitly stated exceptions or limitations in the provided text that alter the general rule or its consequence, given the context of Article 453 and the query.

### Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: A guarantor can require an obligee to first execute on the property of the principal obligor if certain conditions are met.
- **Condition(s)**: 
  - The principal obligor must have the financial resources to pay the obligation.
  - The execution on the principal obligor's property must be easily performed.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**: The obligee must first execute on the principal obligor's property under these conditions.
- **Exception(s)**: None explicitly stated in the context provided.

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root
Given the query, "In order for a guarantor to exercise the right of defense of obligor's solvency, he/she must prove that the principal obligor has the financial resources to pay his/her obligation and that the execution would be easily performed," it directly aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 453.

- The query **entails Base-Level Factor B1**, as both consider the evidence of the principal obligor's ability to pay and the ease of execution on their property.
- The query **agrees with Root R1** because both state that for a guarantor to exercise the right of defense of obligor's solvency, they must prove the principal obligor has the means to pay and that execution can be easily performed.

Upon rejustification, considering the direct alignment between the conditions stated in Article 453 and those presented in the query, it is clear that:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break down the legal argument structure from the given article and then analyze the query in relation to this structure.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The provided text is Article 179, which discusses the extinction of real rights when acquired by the same person under certain conditions.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: If ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person, the other real right is extinguished.
- **Rule 2**: If a real right other than ownership and another right for which that real right is the object are acquired by the same person, the other right is extinguished.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The acquisition of both ownership and another real right on the same thing by the same person.
- **Condition 2**: The acquisition of a real right other than ownership and another right for which that real right is the object by the same person.
- **Exception Condition**: If that thing or the other real right is the object of the right of a third party, the extinction rule does not apply.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence 1**: The extinction of the other real right when both ownership and another real right are acquired by the same person.
- **Legal Consequence 2**: The extinction of the other right when a real right and another right for which that real right is the object are acquired by the same person.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception**: The provisions do not apply if the thing or the other real right is the object of the right of a third party. Additionally, the provisions do not apply to possessory rights.

### Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: 
  - If ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person, the other real right is extinguished.
  - If a real right other than ownership and another right for which that real right is the object are acquired by the same person, the other right is extinguished.
- **Condition(s)**:
  - Acquisition of both rights by the same person.
  - The thing or right not being the object of a third party's right.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**:
  - Extinction of the other real right or the other right.
- **Exception(s)**:
  - If the thing or right is subject to a third party's rights.
  - Possessory rights are exempt.

### Analysis of Query
The query states: "In cases where (B) has the superficy over (A)'s land, which had already been the subject of the mortgage, and registered such fact, the supecify shall be extinguished if B acquires the ownership of A's land."

This scenario involves a real right (superficy) and ownership being acquired by the same person (B), which aligns with **Rule 1**. The query does not mention any third-party rights over the superficy or the land, suggesting that the exception regarding third-party rights may not apply directly here.

### Justification
- **(query entails B1)**: Yes, because the scenario described involves the acquisition of ownership and another real right (superficy) by the same person, which is a base-level factor for applying the rule about extinction of real rights.
- **(query agree R1)**: Yes, the query agrees with the root node R1, which states that if ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person, the other real right is extinguished. The query's conclusion that the superficy shall be extinguished if B acquires the ownership of A's land aligns with this principle.

After re-justification, the analysis holds that the query indeed entails a base-level factor and agrees with the root node regarding the extinction of the superficy upon acquisition of ownership by the same person.

9 correct 8 wrongs 17 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's first analyze the provided legal context step by step:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text includes two articles from a civil legal code: Article 166 discussing prescription and extinction of claims, and Article 412 regarding the due date for performance of an obligation.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: A claim is extinguished by prescription if not exercised within specified time frames (5 years from when the right became exercisable to the obligee, or 10 years from when it became exercisable).
- **Rule 2**: For claims or property rights other than ownership, prescription occurs if not exercised within 20 years.
- **Rule 3**: The obligor is liable for delay in performance based on whether a fixed due date, uncertain due date, or no time limit is assigned to the obligation.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: For Rule 1, the conditions are that the claim must not be exercised within the specified time frames.
- **Condition 2**: For Rule 2, the condition is that the right must not be exercised within 20 years.
- **Condition 3**: For Rule 3, the conditions depend on the type of due date assigned to the obligation (fixed, uncertain, or no time limit).

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence 1**: Extinction of the claim if not exercised within the prescribed time frames.
- **Consequence 2**: Liability for delay in performance based on the type of due date.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1**: The provisions do not preclude the commencement of acquisitive prescription for the benefit of a third party under certain conditions.
- **Exception 2**: The holder of the right may demand acknowledgment from the possessor to renew the prescription period.

### 6. Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: 
  - A claim is extinguished by prescription after specified time frames.
  - An obligor is liable for delay based on the due date type.
- **Condition(s)**: 
  - Non-exercise of the right within specified times.
  - Type of due date assigned to the obligation.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**:
  - Extinction of claims or liability for delay.
- **Exception(s)**:
  - Commencement of acquisitive prescription for third parties.
  - Renewal of prescription period through acknowledgment.

### Analysis of Query and Legal Structure
The query states: "Extinctive prescription for claims with unspecified due date commences to run on the time of arrival of such obligor time limit."

Given Article 412, if no time limit is assigned (which can be considered similar to an unspecified due date), the obligor is liable for delay from the time the obligor receives the request for performance. However, Article 166 discusses prescription periods based on when the right became exercisable or known to the obligee, not directly addressing "unspecified due dates" in the context of when prescription commences.

### Justification
- The query seems to **entail a Base-Level Factor (B1)** related to the timing of extinctive prescription for claims with unspecified due dates, which is somewhat addressed by the rules regarding prescription and liability for delay.
- However, upon closer examination, the query's specifics about "unspecified due date" and "time of arrival of such obligor time limit" do not perfectly align with the conditions outlined in Article 166 or Article 412. 
- The most comparable root (R1) seems to be related to Rule 1 (prescription periods), but the query **disagrees with R1** because it introduces a concept ("unspecified due date") that is not directly addressed by the rule regarding when prescription commences.

### Final Justification
Upon reevaluation, considering the nuances of legal terminology and the specific conditions outlined in the articles:
- The query indeed touches upon a scenario (claims with unspecified due dates) that isn't explicitly covered under the provided rules as summarized.
- Thus, it seems to **entail a Base-Level Factor** but one that is not perfectly encapsulated by the provided rules.
- Given this, and focusing strictly on the most relevant rule (R1 regarding prescription), there appears to be a **disagreement** because the query posits a scenario not directly addressed by R1.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the information step by step.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text includes Article 655 and Article 653 of a civil legal code. Article 655 states that grounds for terminating a mandate cannot be used against another party unless they were notified or knew about it. Article 653 lists specific situations when a mandate terminates, including the death of the mandator or mandatary, bankruptcy proceedings against either, or the commencement of guardianship over the mandatary.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** A mandate can be terminated under certain conditions (death of the mandator or mandatary, bankruptcy proceedings, or commencement of guardianship).
- **Rule 2:** The grounds for termination of a mandate cannot be asserted against another party unless that party was notified of or knew about those grounds.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** For Rule 1, the conditions are specific events like death, bankruptcy, or guardianship.
- **Condition 2:** For Rule 2, the condition is that the other party must have been notified of or knew about the grounds for termination.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence 1:** If any of the conditions in Article 653 are met, the mandate terminates.
- **Consequence 2:** If a party was not notified of or did not know about the grounds for terminating the mandate, they cannot be held to those grounds.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1:** None explicitly stated in Article 653, but Article 655 introduces a condition that can limit the assertion of termination grounds.
- **Exception 2/Clarification:** The query itself presents a scenario where an heir of a deceased mandator may not assert termination due to lack of notification or knowledge by the mandatary.

### Output Format
**Rule(s):**
1. A mandate terminates under specific conditions (death, bankruptcy, guardianship).
2. Grounds for terminating a mandate require notification or knowledge by the other party.

**Condition(s):**
1. Specific events like death, bankruptcy, or guardianship.
2. Notification or knowledge by the other party about the grounds for termination.

**Legal Consequence(s):**
1. Termination of the mandate if conditions are met.
2. Inability to assert termination against a party not notified or unaware of the grounds.

**Exception(s):**
1. Lack of notification or knowledge by the mandatary can prevent assertion of termination grounds, including death of the mandator.

Given this analysis and the query "Even if a mandator died, an heir of the mandator may not assert termination of mandate by death of the mandator against a mandatary, when the mandatary was not notified of or did not know of the same," we can justify as follows:

- **(query entails B1):** The query does indeed consider a base-level factor (B1) related to the conditions under which a mandate's termination can be asserted, specifically focusing on the scenario where a mandator dies and the implications for an heir trying to assert termination against a mandatary without proper notification or knowledge.
- **(query agree R1):** The query agrees with Root Node (R1), which generally states that a mandate terminates under certain conditions but also emphasizes the importance of notification or knowledge by the other party. The specific scenario presented in the query aligns with this principle, as it highlights a situation where termination due to death cannot be asserted without proper notification or knowledge.

Upon careful reconsideration, these justifications hold because the query directly addresses a scenario that is covered by the rules and conditions outlined in Articles 653 and 655. The scenario fits within the framework established for when a mandate can be considered terminated and under what circumstances those grounds can be asserted against another party. Therefore, both the base-level factor consideration and the agreement with the root node's principle are appropriate conclusions based on the given legal context and query.

 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text discusses the assignability of claims, specifically when there is a manifestation of intention to restrict assignment. It outlines rules regarding the validity of assignments despite such restrictions and the rights of obligors and assignees in these situations.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: The validity of the assignment of a claim is not impaired even if a party manifests an intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment.
- **Rule 2**: An obligor may refuse to perform an obligation to a third party (like an assignee) who knew or should have known about the manifestation to restrict assignment, and may assert against such third parties any events that result in the extinguishment of the obligation.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The existence of a manifestation of intention to restrict the assignment of a claim.
- **Condition 2**: The assignee's knowledge or gross negligence regarding the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
- **Condition 3**: Compulsory execution is enforced against the claim by an attaching obligee.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- If Conditions 1 and 2 are met, the obligor may refuse performance to the assignee and assert events leading to obligation extinguishment.
- If Condition 3 is involved (compulsory execution), specific exceptions apply regarding the obligor's ability to refuse performance or assert obligation extinguishment.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1**: Article 466-4(1) states that the provisions of Article 466(3) do not apply to an attaching obligee who has enforced compulsory execution against a claim subject to manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
- **Exception 2**: Even under Exception 1, if the assignee or another third party knew or should have known about the restriction and enforces compulsory execution, the obligor may still refuse performance and assert obligation extinguishment events.

### 6. Output Format
#### Rule(s):
1. Assignment validity is not impaired by a manifestation to restrict assignment.
2. Obligor's rights against assignees with knowledge of restricted assignments.

#### Condition(s):
1. Existence of a restriction manifestation.
2. Assignee's knowledge or gross negligence about the restriction.
3. Compulsory execution against the claim.

#### Legal Consequence(s):
- Obligor may refuse performance and assert obligation extinguishment under certain conditions.
- Specific outcomes depend on compulsory execution and assignee knowledge.

#### Exception(s):
1. Exceptions for attaching obligees in compulsory executions, with further nuances based on assignee knowledge.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria Analysis
Given the query: "Claim X, the claim of the payment of the sales price of A against B, has a special agreement prohibiting the assignment, but C acquired Claim X while knowing the existence of the special agreement prohibiting the assignment. Then D, the obligee of C, enforced compulsory execution against Claim X. In this case, B may not refuse to perform the obligation to D based on the special agreement prohibiting the assignment."

- **Justification**: The query involves a scenario where there's knowledge of a restriction (by C, and thus potentially by D), followed by compulsory execution. This aligns with conditions and exceptions outlined in the rules.
  
- **Base-Level Factor (B1)**: The situation involves an assignee (C) with knowledge of the assignment restriction and subsequent compulsory execution by another party (D), which directly pertains to the applicability of the exceptions, particularly Exception 2 under Article 466-4(2).

- **Query Entails B1**: Since the scenario in the query matches the conditions for considering the assignee's knowledge and the impact of compulsory execution on the obligor's rights.

- **Root Node (R1)**: The primary legal determination here is whether an obligor can refuse performance based on a manifestation to restrict assignment when there's been compulsory execution, which aligns with Rule 2 and Exception 2.

- **Query Agree/Disagree with R1**: Given that the query concludes B may not refuse to perform the obligation under these specific circumstances (knowledge of restriction by assignee and subsequent compulsory execution), it seems to **disagree** with a straightforward application of Rule 2 without considering the exceptions. However, upon closer examination, it actually aligns with Exception 2's nuances regarding compulsory execution and knowledge of assignment restrictions.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- Upon reevaluation for accuracy in interpretation: The query is consistent with the nuanced application of rules and exceptions, particularly how compulsory execution affects obligor rights when assignees are aware of assignment restrictions. Thus, it **agrees** with the principles outlined under R1 when considering all applicable conditions and exceptions.

Corrected conclusion:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

 To address the given task, let's break down the legal article context step by step according to the instructions provided.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text is Article 298, which discusses the rights and responsibilities of the holder of a right of retention regarding the thing retained.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: The holder of a right of retention must possess the thing retained with the due care of a prudent manager.
- **Rule 2**: The holder may not use, lease, or provide as security the thing retained without the obligor's consent, except for uses necessary for preservation.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: If the holder of the right of retention violates the provisions regarding due care.
- **Condition 2**: If the holder uses, leases, or provides as security the thing retained without obtaining the obligor's consent, outside of preservation needs.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that the obligor may demand that the right of retention be terminated if the holder violates the provisions of the preceding paragraphs.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception**: Uses necessary for the preservation of the thing retained are allowed without needing the obligor's consent.

### 6. Output Format
Given the instructions, here is the structured format:
   
**Rule(s)**: 
1. The holder must care for the retained thing as a prudent manager would.
2. The holder cannot use, lease, or secure the thing without the obligor's consent, except for preservation purposes.

**Condition(s)**: 
1. Violation of due care provisions.
2. Unauthorized use, leasing, or securing of the thing.

**Legal Consequence(s)**: 
The obligor can demand termination of the right of retention upon violation of the rules.

**Exception(s)**: 
Preservation uses are exempt from needing consent.

---

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "If a holder of a right of retention leased the Thing retained unless he/she obtains the consent of the obligor, the obligor may demand that the right of retention be extinguished."

This scenario directly relates to **Condition 2** and its associated **Legal Consequence**, as it specifies a situation where the holder leases the thing without consent.

### Entailment and Agreement

- The query entails **Base-Level Factor B1**: Leasing the thing retained without the obligor's consent.
- The query agrees with **Root R1**: The obligor may demand termination (or extinguishment, as the query states) of the right of retention in such a scenario.

Justification: Both the original article and the query describe a situation where unauthorized leasing leads to the obligor having the right to end the retention. Thus, they consider evidence in a similar situation (unauthorized use leading to potential termination of rights).

Upon careful reconsideration, this analysis remains consistent with the provided instructions and context.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)

 To address the task step by step:

### 1. Read the Provided Text:
The provided text is Article 566, which discusses the limitation on the period of warranty with respect to the kind or quality of subject matter in a contract for sale.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle):
- The general principle stated in Article 566 is that if the buyer fails to notify the seller of non-conformity regarding the kind or quality of the subject matter within one year from the time they become aware of it, the buyer may not demand cure, reduction of price, claim compensation for loss or damage, or cancel the contract due to this non-conformity.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability):
- The conditions under which this rule applies include:
  - The subject matter delivered does not conform to the terms of the contract regarding kind or quality.
  - The buyer fails to notify the seller of the non-conformity within one year from when they became aware of it.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome):
- The legal consequence is that the buyer loses the right to demand cure, a reduction in price, claim compensation for loss or damage, or cancel the contract based on the non-conformity.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases):
- An exception is if the seller knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery. In such cases, the limitation does not apply.

### 6. Output Format:
Given the instructions and analysis:

**Rule(s):**
- A buyer who fails to notify the seller of non-conformity regarding kind or quality within one year from becoming aware of it cannot later demand cure, price reduction, compensation for loss or damage, or contract cancellation due to this non-conformity.

**Condition(s):**
1. Non-conformity exists regarding kind or quality.
2. Buyer fails to notify seller within one year of becoming aware of the non-conformity.

**Legal Consequence(s):**
- The buyer loses rights to demand cure, price reduction, compensation, or contract cancellation based on non-conformity.

**Exception(s):**
- If the seller knew or was grossly negligent about the non-conformity at delivery, the one-year notification limit does not apply.

Regarding the query and its relationship with base-level factors and root nodes:

- The query involves a situation where the quality of movable X does not conform to contract terms, the seller did not know of the non-conformity without negligence, and the buyer failed to notify within the statutory period.
- This scenario directly aligns with **Base-Level Factor B1**, which would concern the failure to notify within the specified time frame and the implications thereof on demanding compensation for damages.

Thus, (query entails B1).

Considering the alignment with the root node **R1** regarding the inability to demand compensation due to non-notification within the statutory period:

- The query agrees that if the buyer fails to notify the seller within the one-year limit and there's no gross negligence from the seller, the buyer cannot demand compensation for damages.

Therefore, (query agree R1).

Upon reevaluation:
- The query still aligns with B1 because it involves a scenario where notification was not made in time.
- It also agrees with R1 as both conclude that in such scenarios, without exceptions like gross negligence from the seller, the buyer cannot demand compensation for damages.

Hence, the justification remains consistent: (query entails B1) and (query agree R1).

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's first break down the legal article context into its components based on the instructions provided.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text has been carefully read and understood. It discusses a scenario where a manager intervenes in another's business to prevent imminent danger, under certain conditions, without being liable for damages unless acting in bad faith or with gross negligence.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle stated is that a person who engages in benevolent intervention to prevent harm to another's person, reputation, or property is not liable for resulting damages.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which this rule applies include:
- The intervention must be benevolent.
- The purpose of the intervention is to prevent imminent danger to the principal's person, reputation, or property.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that the intervenor is not liable for damages resulting from their actions under the specified conditions.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
An exception to this rule is if the intervenor acts in bad faith or with gross negligence, they may be liable for damages.

### Output Format
Given the instructions:

- **Rule(s):** A person intervening benevolently to prevent harm is not liable for damages.
- **Condition(s):**
  - The intervention must be benevolent.
  - It aims to prevent imminent danger to person, reputation, or property.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The intervenor is not liable for resulting damages under the conditions.
- **Exception(s):** Acting in bad faith or with gross negligence may lead to liability.

Now, addressing the query and its relation to the ANGELIC structure formation criteria:

The query discusses a scenario where an individual rescues another from getting hit by a car but causes damage to their luxury kimono. The question is whether the rescuer must compensate for the damages under Article 698's context.

- **Justification of Base-Level Factor Entailment:** The query entails a base-level factor (let's label it B1) because both the query and B1 consider evidence in similar scenarios where an intervention leads to some form of damage. Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.
  
- **Agreement with Root Node Verdict:** Considering the root node R1 represents the general principle that a benevolent intervenor is not liable for damages unless acting in bad faith or gross negligence, and applying this to the query's scenario where an individual pushes another out of harm's way (thus intervening benevolently), it can be inferred that **(query agree R1)**. This is because both scenarios involve actions taken to prevent greater harm, aligning with the principle outlined in Article 698.

- **Re-justification:** Upon re-evaluation, considering the specifics of the query and the conditions under which the rule applies (benevolent intervention to prevent imminent danger), it's clear that pushing someone out of the way to avoid a car accident fits within these parameters. The damage to the kimono is an incidental consequence of the action taken to prevent greater harm (injury or death from being hit by a car). Thus, the initial conclusion stands: the query aligns with the root node's verdict regarding non-liability for damages resulting from benevolent intervention.

Therefore, after careful analysis and re-justification:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal context and query according to the instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text is read carefully, including Article 417 and the query about compensation for loss or damage due to non-performance.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- The general principle stated in Article 417 is that unless a particular intention is manifested, the amount of compensation for loss or damage is determined with reference to monetary value.
- Another rule implied by the query is that compensation for loss or damage due to non-performance may not be satisfied by any method other than the payment of money.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- The condition under which the first rule applies is that there must be no particular intention manifested regarding how the compensation should be determined.
- For the second rule, the condition seems to be the occurrence of non-performance.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- The legal consequence of the first rule is that compensation will be determined based on monetary value if no other intention is expressed.
- The consequence of the second rule is that only payment in money can satisfy the compensation for loss or damage due to non-performance.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- An exception mentioned is "unless a particular intention is manifested," which alters the general method of determining compensation from monetary value to whatever method was intended.
- There's no explicit exception in the query, but it could be seen as presenting a scenario where non-monetary satisfaction isn't an option.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the analysis:
   
Rule(s):
1. Compensation for loss or damage is determined with reference to monetary value unless a particular intention is manifested.
2. Compensation for loss or damage due to non-performance must be satisfied by payment of money.

Condition(s):
1. No particular intention regarding compensation determination is manifested.
2. Non-performance occurs.

Legal Consequence(s):
1. Compensation is determined based on monetary value.
2. Only payment in money satisfies the compensation.

Exception(s):
- If a particular intention is manifested, the method of determining compensation can differ from monetary value.

### Angelic Structure Formation Criteria and Justification

Based on the analysis:
- **Root Node (R)**: The primary determination that compensation for loss or damage is based on monetary value unless otherwise intended.
- **Abstract Factors**: Determination methods, intention manifestation.
- **Base-Level Factors (B)**: Monetary value determination, payment in money as satisfaction.

The query directly relates to a Base-Level Factor (let's label it B1) since it discusses the method of compensation satisfaction. Thus, **(query entails B1)**.

Given that the root node (R1) implies that compensation should be based on monetary value unless otherwise intended and the query states that compensation may not be satisfied by any method other than payment of money, they are in agreement regarding the importance of monetary compensation for loss or damage. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After careful reconsideration, this analysis holds because both the query and the root node emphasize the role of monetary value in determining compensation for loss or damage, with the query specifying that only payment in money is acceptable for non-performance scenarios.

 To address the given task, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes two articles from a civil legal context:
- Article 176 discusses the creation and transfer of real rights becoming effective through the manifestations of intention of the parties.
- Article 177 mentions that acquisitions, losses, or changes in real rights on immovables must be registered to be asserted against third parties.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
Two rules can be identified:
1. The creation and transfer of a real right become effective solely by the manifestations of intention of the parties.
2. For acquisitions, losses, or changes in real rights on immovables to be duly asserted against any third parties, registration is required.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
Conditions for these rules include:
- The existence of a manifestation of intention between parties for the creation or transfer of a real right.
- The requirement that the subject matter of the real right is an immovable for the registration condition to apply.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequences are:
- A real right is created or transferred if the parties manifest their intention to do so.
- Acquisitions, losses, or changes in real rights on immovables cannot be asserted against third parties unless registered.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
An exception mentioned is related to the assertion of rights against third parties, which requires registration for immovable properties. There's no explicit mention of exceptions to the manifestation of intention for real right creation or transfer.

### Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** 
  1. Real rights are created or transferred through manifestations of party intentions.
  2. Registration is necessary for asserting changes in immovable real rights against third parties.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Existence of a manifestation of intention between parties.
  - The subject matter being an immovable for registration requirements.
- **Legal Consequence(s):**
  - Effective creation or transfer of real rights through party intentions.
  - Assertion of rights against third parties requires registration for immovables.
- **Exception(s):**
  - Registration requirement for asserting rights against third parties regarding immovables.

### Analysis of Query and Legal Structure
Given the query: "If a mortgage creation contract has the agreement of the mortgagee and of the mortgagor that has ownership of the subject matter of the mortgage, it will be effective even if it is not in writing and there is no registration of its creation."

This query considers a scenario where a real right (a mortgage) is created through an agreement between parties, which aligns with Article 176. However, for this mortgage to be asserted against third parties, given it involves an immovable (as mortgages typically do), registration would be required according to Article 177.

### Justification
The query entails a Base-Level Factor because it discusses the effectiveness of a mortgage creation contract based on party agreement, which is similar to the scenario considered under Article 176. Thus, **(query entails B1)**, where B1 could represent the factor of "party intention" in real right creation.

However, when considering the assertion of this mortgage against third parties without registration, the query might seem to disagree with the root principle (R1) that emphasizes the necessity of registration for such assertions regarding immovables. But upon closer examination, the query's focus is on the effectiveness of the contract between the parties involved, not its assertion against third parties. Therefore, it doesn't directly contradict the need for registration to assert rights against third parties. The query and root R1, which could represent the principle of requiring registration for immovable property rights assertions, actually **(query agree R1)** in the context that the creation of the mortgage is effective between parties but would require registration to be asserted against others.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of the legal principles involved and the specific scenario presented by the query, it's clear that while the query does align with the principle of party intention being sufficient for real right creation (thus entailing B1), its agreement with R1 regarding the broader context of registration for asserting rights against third parties is more about the scope of application rather than direct disagreement. Hence, the initial analysis stands with a nuanced understanding that the query's scenario specifically focuses on the inter-party effectiveness of the mortgage contract rather than its external assertion.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break down the provided legal article context and query according to the instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text is Article 457, which discusses the relationship between a principal obligor, a guarantor, and an obligee in terms of prescription periods, defenses, and rights such as set-off, rescind, or cancel.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
1. The postponement of expiry and renewal of prescription periods affecting the principal obligor also affect the guarantor.
2. A guarantor can assert defenses that the principal obligor could raise against the obligee.
3. A guarantor may refuse to perform an obligation if the principal obligor has rights (set-off, rescind, or cancel) that would release them from the obligation.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
1. The conditions under which these rules apply include:
   - The existence of a prescription period and its expiry or renewal.
   - The principal obligor having defenses or rights against the obligee.
   - The guarantor being requested to perform an obligation.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
1. The legal consequences include:
   - The guarantor being affected by changes in prescription periods related to the principal obligor.
   - The guarantor being able to raise certain defenses against the obligee.
   - The guarantor potentially refusing to perform obligations under specific circumstances.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
1. Exceptions or limitations are not explicitly stated in terms of altering the general rules but are implied within the conditions and consequences, such as the principal obligor's rights being exercised or not.

### Step 6: Output Format
Rule(s):
- The postponement/renewal of prescription periods for the principal obligor affects the guarantor.
- A guarantor can assert defenses available to the principal obligor.
- A guarantor may refuse performance if the principal obligor has certain rights against the obligee.

Condition(s):
- Existence of a prescription period and its manipulations.
- Principal obligor's defenses or rights against the obligee.
- Request for the guarantor to perform an obligation.

Legal Consequence(s):
- Guarantor is affected by prescription period changes.
- Guarantor can raise principal obligor's defenses.
- Guarantor may refuse performance under certain conditions.

Exception(s):
- Implicit exceptions based on the exercise of rights by the principal obligor or specific conditions not being met.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "Until the principal obligor offsets with a possessed claim, the guarantor cannot raise a defense vis-a-vis the obligee by setting off any claim."

This query seems to address a specific scenario related to set-off rights and when a guarantor can exercise them. The query entails considering the evidence in a similar situation or scenario as **Base-Level Factor B1**, which could be about the conditions under which a guarantor can raise defenses, specifically regarding set-off.

Therefore, (query entails B1).

Regarding agreement with the root:
- The root (R1) essentially states that a guarantor may assert defenses available to the principal obligor and may refuse performance if the principal obligor has rights like set-off.
- The query suggests a specific condition ("Until the principal obligor offsets...") under which the guarantor's ability to raise a defense by set-off is limited.

Given this, it seems the query **disagrees** with the general principle stated in R1 because R1 does not specify that the guarantor cannot raise a defense until the principal obligor acts. Instead, R1 suggests the guarantor can assert defenses available to the principal obligor without such a condition being explicitly stated.

Thus, (query disagree R1).

After careful reconsideration, this analysis holds because the query introduces a specific scenario not directly addressed by the general rules outlined in Article 457, particularly emphasizing a timing and action sequence (the principal obligor must offset first) that is not explicitly mentioned in the article as a condition for the guarantor's actions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's follow the step-by-step process.

### 1. Read the Provided Text:
The text discusses two articles related to the transfer of possession and ownership of movables. Article 182(2) mentions that if a transferee or their agent is already holding the thing under possession, the transfer of possessory rights can be effected by the parties' manifestations of intention alone. Article 178 states that the transfer of a real right on movables cannot be duly asserted against a third party unless the movables are delivered.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle):
- **Rule 1:** The transfer of possessory rights to movables can occur through the parties' manifestations of intention if the transferee or their agent already possesses the item.
- **Rule 2:** For the transfer of a real right on movables to be valid against third parties, delivery of the movables is required.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability):
- **Condition for Rule 1:** The transferee or their agent must already be in possession of the movable item.
- **Condition for Rule 2:** Delivery of the movables is necessary for the transfer to be valid against third parties.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome):
- **Consequence of Rule 1:** The transfer of possessory rights is effective without needing actual delivery, allowing the transferee to assert possession based on the agreement.
- **Consequence of Rule 2:** The transferor can duly assert the acquisition of ownership against any third party once delivery has occurred.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases):
- No explicit exceptions are mentioned in the provided text, but it implies that without delivery (in cases where possession is not already held by the transferee), the transfer cannot be asserted against third parties.

### Output Format:
**Rule(s):**
1. The transfer of possessory rights to movables can occur through manifestations of intention if the transferee or their agent already possesses the item.
2. For a real right on movables, delivery is necessary for validity against third parties.

**Condition(s):**
1. The transferee or their agent must be in possession for Rule 1 to apply.
2. Delivery is required for the transfer to be valid against third parties under Rule 2.

**Legal Consequence(s):**
1. Effective transfer of possessory rights without needing actual delivery if already in possession.
2. Ability to assert ownership against third parties after delivery.

**Exception(s):**
None explicitly stated, but implied that lack of delivery (when not already in possession) invalidates the transfer against third parties.

Given the query and the analysis:
- **Query:** B kept Painting X, owned by A, from A and possessed it. Thereafter B purchased X from A, and A and B manifested an intention to transfer the possession to B. In this case, B may duly assert the acquisition of the ownership of X against any third parties.
- Since B was already in possession of Painting X and both parties manifested the intention to transfer possession (which aligns with Article 182(2) for possessory rights but also involves a purchase which implies delivery is not necessary as per the specific scenario described), we can say:
  - **(query entails B1):** Yes, because the query considers a situation where the conditions for transferring possessory rights and asserting ownership (based on prior possession and manifestation of intention) are met.
- Comparing this to our root nodes (Rules), specifically Rule 2 which deals with the validity against third parties:
  - **(query agree R1):** Yes, because if we consider R1 as representing the rule that transfer can be valid against third parties when conditions are met (such as delivery or prior possession and intention manifestation), then B's ability to assert ownership aligns with this principle given the scenario's specifics.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of both rules and the specific scenario provided in the query:
- The initial analysis stands because the query directly pertains to a base-level factor (prior possession and intention to transfer) that is crucial for determining the validity of the transfer against third parties.
- The agreement with the root node (R1, if we generalize it as the principle of valid transfer against third parties under certain conditions) also holds, given that B's situation satisfies the conditions outlined in Article 182(2) and implicitly meets the requirements for asserting ownership against third parties as per Article 178, due to the prior possession and subsequent purchase/intention manifestation.

 To address the problem, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions provided.


## Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The given legal statement or article is Article 655, which states: "The grounds of termination of mandate may not be asserted against the other party unless the other party was notified of or knew of the same."


## Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The rule can be stated as: "A party cannot assert grounds for terminating a mandate against another party without the latter's knowledge or notification of those grounds."


## Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which this rule applies are:
- The other party must have been notified of the grounds for termination.
- Alternatively, the other party must have known about the grounds for termination.


## Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that if the conditions are not met (i.e., the other party was neither notified nor had knowledge), then the grounds for termination of mandate cannot be asserted against them.


## Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There's an implicit exception in the "unless" clause, suggesting that if the other party did know or was notified about the grounds, then those grounds can indeed be asserted against them.


## Step 6: Output Format
Rule(s): A party cannot assert grounds for terminating a mandate without the other party's knowledge or notification.
Condition(s): The other party must have been notified or must have known about the grounds for termination.
Legal Consequence(s): If conditions are not met, grounds for termination cannot be asserted.
Exception(s): If the other party knew or was notified, then the grounds can be asserted.


Given the query: "Regardless of the other party's knowledge, the grounds of termination of mandate may not be asserted against the other party unless the other party was notified of the same."
- This query modifies the original rule by emphasizing notification as the sole condition, disregarding the other party's knowledge.
- It aligns with the base-level factor concerning notification but differs in its treatment of the other party's knowledge.


Considering the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:
- The root node (R1) represents the original rule about needing notification or knowledge to assert termination grounds.
- An abstract factor could be the concept of "awareness" (A1), encompassing both notification and knowledge.
- A base-level factor (B1) could specifically be "notification" as a condition for asserting termination grounds.


The query entails base-level factor B1 because it emphasizes notification as a critical condition, similar to how B1 focuses on the necessity of notification. However, the query seems to disagree with the root R1 by suggesting that knowledge is not a relevant factor, whereas R1 includes both knowledge and notification as valid conditions for asserting termination grounds.


Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)


Upon reevaluation, considering the nuances of legal language and the specific phrasing of the query and the original rule, it's clear that the disagreement stems from the query's exclusion of "knowledge" as a separate condition. The original rule allows for either notification or knowledge, while the query only acknowledges notification as sufficient.


The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B1), (query disagree R1)}$

 To address the given task, we first analyze the provided legal article context and then apply the step-by-step process to extract the legal argument structure.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses Article 398-7, which pertains to the conditions under which a revolving mortgage can or cannot be exercised with respect to certain claims or obligations before the principal is crystallized.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principles stated in the article are:
1. A person who acquires a claim from a revolving mortgagee before the principal is crystallized may not exercise the revolving mortgage with respect to that claim.
2. The revolving mortgagee may not exercise the revolving mortgage with respect to an obligation assumed by another party before the principal is crystallized.
3. Certain transfers of obligations or novations do not allow for the transfer of the revolving mortgage before the principal is crystallized.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which these rules apply include:
- Acquisition of a claim from a revolving mortgagee before the principal is crystallized.
- Assumption of an obligation by another party before the principal is crystallized.
- Effecting the assumption of an obligation releasing an old obligor or novation due to substitution of the obligee or obligor before the principal is crystallized.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequences are:
- The inability to exercise the revolving mortgage with respect to certain claims or obligations.
- Restrictions on transferring the revolving mortgage in cases of obligation assumption, novation due to substitution of the obligee, or other similar situations before the principal is crystallized.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
The exceptions mentioned include scenarios where payments are made for or on behalf of an obligor and specific novation cases, which are subject to restrictions regarding the transfer of the revolving mortgage.

### Output Format
Given the instructions:
- **Rule(s):** 
  1. A person who acquires a claim from a revolving mortgagee before the principal is crystallized cannot exercise the revolving mortgage with respect to that claim.
  2. The revolving mortgagee may not exercise the revolving mortgage for obligations assumed before the principal is crystallized.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Acquisition of claims or assumption of obligations before the principal is crystallized.
  - Specific scenarios like novation and payment on behalf of an obligor.
- **Legal Consequence(s):**
  - Inability to exercise the revolving mortgage for certain claims or obligations.
  - Restrictions on transferring the revolving mortgage in specific situations.
- **Exception(s):**
  - Payments made for or on behalf of an obligor, subject to restrictions.
  - Novation scenarios with limitations on transferring the revolving mortgage.

### Angelic Structure Formation Criteria
To assess whether the query entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root node (R1), we need to understand that:
- **Root Node (R):** Represents the core legal determination, such as the inability to exercise a revolving mortgage under certain conditions.
- **Abstract Factors (A):** General concepts like "acquisition of claims" or "assumption of obligations."
- **Base-Level Factors (B):** Specific scenarios described in the article and query, such as performing secured claims after the due date.

### Query Analysis
The query discusses a third party executing a revolving mortgage in subrogation to secure reimbursement from an obligor before the principal is fixed. This scenario appears to involve specific conditions (secured claims performed after the due date) and outcomes (execution of the revolving mortgage for security).

### Justification
- **Query entails Base-Level Factor B1:** The query does indeed consider a specific scenario similar to those described in the article, involving the execution of a revolving mortgage under particular conditions. Thus, **(query entails B1)**.
- **Agreement with Root Node R1:** The root node generally states that under certain conditions (like before the principal is crystallized), exercising or transferring a revolving mortgage may not be allowed. However, the query presents a scenario where a third party can execute the revolving mortgage for security purposes in subrogation, which seems to differ from the restrictions outlined in the article. Therefore, considering the most comparable situation, **(query disagree R1)**.

Upon re-justification, it's clear that the query involves specific conditions and outcomes related to executing a revolving mortgage before the principal is fixed, aligning with base-level factors but presenting a scenario that may not fully align with the general principles outlined in the article regarding restrictions on exercising or transferring revolving mortgages under similar conditions.

 To address the given task, let's first analyze the provided legal article context step by step.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text has been carefully read and understood. It pertains to Article 663 of a civil legal code, discussing the timing of the return of a bailed thing (or item) by the bailee (the party holding the item) back to the bailor (the owner of the item).

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
There are two rules stated:
1. If the parties have not specified the timing of the return, the bailee may return the item at any time.
2. If the timing of the return is specified, the bailee generally cannot return the item before the due date unless there's a compelling reason.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions for these rules are:
- The absence or presence of an agreement on the timing of the return.
- The existence of a "compelling reason" to return the item early when a specific return time has been agreed upon.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequences are:
- The bailee can return the item at any time if no specific return time is agreed upon.
- The bailee must wait until the specified return time unless there's a compelling reason to do otherwise.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
The exception mentioned is the presence of a "compelling reason" which allows for early return even when a specific due date has been set.

### Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** 
  1. The bailee may return the item at any time if no return timing is specified.
  2. The bailee must wait until the agreed return time unless there's a compelling reason to return it earlier.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Absence or presence of an agreement on the return timing.
  - Existence of a compelling reason for early return when a specific time is agreed upon.
- **Legal Consequence(s):**
  - Flexible return time if not specified; otherwise, adherence to the agreed time unless there's a compelling reason.
- **Exception(s):**
  - Presence of a compelling reason allowing for early return despite an agreed due date.

Now, addressing the query: "When the depositor died, if the timing of the return is specified, the depositary may return the deposited goods prior to the due date."

### Analysis
The query introduces a new condition (the death of the depositor) not explicitly mentioned in the provided rules. However, it does involve a specific scenario related to the timing of return and the possibility of returning goods early.

### Application to ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
- **Root Node (R):** The primary legal determination here revolves around the conditions under which a bailee can return an item.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships:** 
  - Root Node R1: The general rule about returning bailed items based on agreed timing or lack thereof.
  - Abstract Factor A1: The concept of "compelling reason" for early return.
  - Base-Level Factor B1: The death of the depositor as a potential compelling reason.

### Justification
- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** (query entails B1) because it introduces a specific scenario (death of the depositor) that could be considered under the umbrella of "compelling reasons" for early return, depending on interpretation and context not explicitly covered by the provided rules.
- **Agreement with Root Node:** The query does not directly agree or disagree with R1 as stated. However, if considering the introduction of a new condition (death of the depositor) that could potentially be seen as a compelling reason for early return under certain interpretations, then it might align more closely with an exception to the rule rather than a direct contradiction.

### Re-Justification
Upon reconsideration, the query indeed suggests a scenario that could potentially fall under the category of a "compelling reason" for returning goods before the agreed-upon time. Thus, while it does not directly state an agreement or disagreement with R1, its introduction of a specific condition (death of the depositor) as a potential basis for early return implies a nuanced interpretation of what might constitute a compelling reason.

Given this analysis and focusing strictly on the output format requested:
- (query entails B1)
- The query's alignment with R1 is not straightforward but leans towards an interpretation that could be seen as agreeing under specific circumstances, particularly if the death of the depositor is considered a compelling reason. However, since the direct agreement or disagreement was to be stated in a specific format which doesn't perfectly apply here due to the nuances involved:
- (query agree R1) might not fully capture the complexity of the situation without additional context on how "compelling reasons" are defined and applied.

 Let's break down the given legal context and query step by step according to the provided instructions.

### 1. Read the Provided Text:

The text provides two articles from a civil legal code:
- Article 533 discusses the condition under which a party to a bilateral contract may refuse to perform their obligations until the other party tenders their performance.
- Article 546 mentions that the provisions of Article 533 apply to the preceding article, implying a broad application of the principle stated in Article 533.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)

1. **Rule**: A party to a bilateral contract can refuse to fulfill their obligations if the other party has not yet performed or tendered their performance.
2. **Rule**: The obligation to perform is interdependent, suggesting that performances are considered simultaneous when one party's obligation is contingent upon the other's.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)

- **Condition**: The rule applies unless the other party's obligation is not yet due.
- **Condition**: For the provisions of Article 533 to apply mutatis mutandis (with necessary changes) as stated in Article 546, there must be a preceding article that deals with similar or related contractual obligations.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)

- **Legal Consequence**: If one party refuses to perform due to the other's non-performance or non-tendering of performance, and the condition is met (the obligation is due), then the refusing party is justified in not fulfilling their obligation.
- **Legal Consequence**: In cases where Article 533 applies (including by mutatis mutandis through Article 546), parties are entitled to withhold performance until they receive or are tendered the other party's performance.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)

- **Exception**: The obligation of the other party must be due for the refusing party to justify non-performance.
- **Limitation**: The application of Article 533 through Article 546 depends on the specific context and obligations outlined in the preceding article.

### 6. Output Format

**Rule(s)**:
1. A party can refuse to perform their contractual obligations if the other party has not performed or tendered performance.
2. Obligations are interdependent, suggesting simultaneous performances when one is contingent upon the other.

**Condition(s)**:
- The other party's obligation must be due.
- Application of Article 533 through Article 546 depends on the context and specific obligations in the preceding article.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
- A party can justify refusing to perform if the conditions are met.
- Parties are entitled to withhold performance until they receive or are tendered the other party's performance.

**Exception(s)**:
- If the obligation of the other party is not yet due, the rule does not apply.
- The specific application can depend on the context and obligations outlined in related articles.

Given the query: "In a buyer has cancelled the sales contract of the building which is not registered yet because of a latent defect of it, the seller's obligation of reimbursement and the buyer's obligation to return the building have the relationship of simultaneous performances."

**Analysis**:
- The query involves a situation where a buyer cancels a sales contract due to a latent defect in the building. This scenario implies that the buyer is refusing to continue with their obligations under the contract (e.g., payment) because of the seller's non-performance (providing a defect-free property).
- The legal principle from Article 533 supports the idea that performances can be considered simultaneous, especially when one party's obligation is contingent upon the other's. In this case, the buyer's obligation to pay and the seller's obligation to provide a defect-free property are interdependent.

**Conclusion**:
- **(query entails B1)**: The query does entail a Base-Level Factor because it involves a scenario similar to what Article 533 describes—two parties with obligations that are contingent upon each other.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query agrees with the Root Node (R1) in that both consider scenarios where performances are simultaneous or contingent, supporting the principle that a party can refuse to perform if the other party has not tendered their performance.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of the scenario and the legal principles provided:
- The buyer's cancellation due to a latent defect implies a refusal to perform based on the seller's non-performance (failure to deliver a defect-free property).
- This aligns with the principle that performances can be considered simultaneous and that one party can refuse to fulfill their obligations if the other party has not performed or tendered performance, as per Article 533.

Therefore, the conclusion stands: **(query entails B1)** and **(query agree R1)**.

 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's follow the step-by-step instructions provided:

### 1. Read the Provided Text:
The text includes Article 120, which discusses the conditions under which certain acts can be rescinded due to issues like lack of qualified legal capacity, mistake, fraud, or duress.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: An act that is voidable because the person who did it lacks the qualified legal capacity to act can only be rescinded by the person with qualified legal capacity or their agent/successor.
- **Rule 2**: An act voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress can only be rescinded by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention or their agent/successor.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition for Rule 1**: The act must be voidable on the grounds of the qualified legal capacity to act.
- **Condition for Rule 2**: The act must be voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence of Rule 1**: Only specific individuals (those with qualified legal capacity or their agents/successors) can rescind the act.
- **Consequence of Rule 2**: Similarly, only the person affected by the mistake, fraud, or duress (or their agent/successor) can rescind the act.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in the text provided for these rules.

### 6. Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: Two rules regarding the rescission of voidable acts due to lack of qualified legal capacity and due to mistake, fraud, or duress.
- **Condition(s)**: Acts must be voidable on specific grounds (lack of qualified legal capacity or mistake, fraud, or duress).
- **Legal Consequence(s)**: Rescission is limited to specific individuals based on the grounds for voidability.
- **Exception(s)**: None explicitly stated.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria Analysis
Given the query "A minor may rescind the juristic act which is performed without the consent of his/her statutory agent individually," let's analyze if it entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root:

- The query considers a situation where a minor (someone typically lacking full legal capacity) attempts to rescind an act performed without their statutory agent's consent. This scenario directly relates to **Rule 1** regarding acts voidable due to lack of qualified legal capacity.
- **(query entails B1)**: Yes, because the query involves a base-level factor concerning the legal capacity of a minor to perform or rescind juristic acts.
  
Given the context and the rules identified:
- The root (R1) suggests that only a person with qualified legal capacity (or their agent/successor) can rescind an act voidable due to lack of qualified legal capacity. Since minors typically do not have full qualified legal capacity, they would generally not be able to rescind such acts individually without the involvement or consent of their statutory agent.
- **(query disagree R1)**: Yes, because the query posits a scenario where a minor can individually rescind an act, which contradicts the general principle outlined in Rule 1 that requires the involvement of someone with qualified legal capacity (like a statutory agent for a minor).

After re-justification:
The initial analysis stands. The query does indeed involve considerations related to base-level factors concerning legal capacity and acts performed by minors. It also disagrees with the root principle as stated, given the specifics about who can rescind certain types of voidable acts.

Therefore, the final answer is: 
(query entails B1) 
(query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task given, let's break down the legal article context and the query according to the provided instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The given legal statement is from Article 649, which discusses the financial obligations between a mandator (the person giving the mandate) and a mandatary (the person receiving the mandate) in the context of costs incurred while administering a mandated business. The query poses a scenario regarding the timing of when the mandatary can request reimbursement for costs.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle stated is that if costs will be incurred in administering the mandated business, the mandator must pay an advance for those costs at the request of the mandatary.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The condition under which this rule applies is when costs will be incurred in administering the mandated business. Another implicit condition is that the mandatary requests an advance for these costs.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence of meeting these conditions is that the mandator must pay an advance to the mandatary for the costs incurred in administering the mandated business.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in the provided text. However, the query suggests a scenario where the mandatary may not request reimbursement until after having paid those costs, which could be seen as an implied exception or limitation but is more accurately described as a contradictory statement to the rule.

### Step 6: Output Format

- **Rule(s):** The mandator must pay an advance for costs incurred in administering the mandated business if requested by the mandatary.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Costs will be incurred in administering the mandated business.
  - The mandatary requests an advance for these costs.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The mandator is obligated to pay an advance for the costs.
- **Exception(s):** None explicitly stated, but the query implies a potential disagreement with the rule regarding the timing of reimbursement requests.

Given this analysis and moving on to the justification:

The query "The mandatary may not request the costs that are incurred in administering the mandated business until after having paid those costs" directly contradicts the original rule which states that the mandator must pay an advance for these costs at the request of the mandatary. This indicates a disagreement with the root (R1) regarding the timing and nature of cost reimbursement.

- **(query entails B1):** Yes, because it discusses the scenario of requesting costs, which is a base-level factor related to the administration of mandated business.
- **(query disagree R1):** Yes, because the query suggests that the mandatary cannot request reimbursement until after paying the costs, which directly contradicts the rule stated in Article 649.

After rejustification, the conclusion remains that the query entails a base-level factor related to cost administration and disagrees with the root (R1) on the matter of when the mandatary can request reimbursement for costs incurred.

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text provided is Article 419, which discusses the compensation for loss or damage due to failure in performing an obligation to deliver money.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: The amount of compensation for failure to deliver money is determined based on the statutory interest rate at the time the obligor becomes responsible for the delay.
- **Rule 2**: If an agreed-upon interest rate exceeds the statutory interest rate, the agreed-upon rate prevails.
- **Rule 3**: The obligee does not need to prove loss or damage for this compensation.
- **Rule 4**: The obligor cannot use force majeure as a defense against this compensation.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The failure to perform an obligation to deliver money.
- **Condition 2**: An agreed-upon interest rate that exceeds the statutory interest rate.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence 1**: The obligor must pay compensation based on the statutory or agreed-upon interest rate.
- **Legal Consequence 2**: The obligee receives this compensation without needing to prove loss or damage.
- **Legal Consequence 3**: The obligor's defense of force majeure is not valid in this context.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1**: If an interest rate is agreed upon and it exceeds the statutory rate, the agreed-upon rate applies.
- **Limitation 1**: The defense of force majeure cannot be used by the obligor.

### Output Format

**Rule(s)**:
1. Compensation for failure to deliver money is based on the statutory interest rate.
2. An agreed-upon interest rate prevails if it exceeds the statutory rate.
3. No proof of loss or damage is needed for this compensation.
4. Force majeure cannot be used as a defense.

**Condition(s)**:
1. Failure to perform an obligation to deliver money.
2. Presence of an agreed-upon interest rate exceeding the statutory rate.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
1. Obligor pays compensation based on the applicable interest rate.
2. Obligee receives compensation without proving loss or damage.
3. Obligor cannot use force majeure as a defense.

**Exception(s)**:
1. Agreed-upon interest rates take precedence over statutory rates if higher.
2. Limitation on using force majeure as a defense.

Given the query: "The obligor may not be exempted from the responsibility on the ground of force majeure with respect to the compensation for loss or damage for failure to perform the obligation of payment of the loan pursuant to the monetary loan agreement."

- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor B1**: The query is considering a scenario where an obligor fails to pay a loan, which aligns with the conditions discussed in Article 419 regarding the obligation to deliver money. Thus, (query entails B1).
  
- **Agreement with Root R1**: The root legal determination here seems to be that an obligor cannot avoid responsibility for compensation due to failure in payment obligations by claiming force majeure. The query agrees with this determination as it states the obligor may not be exempted from responsibility on these grounds, directly aligning with Rule 4 and Legal Consequence 3. Therefore, (query agree R1).

Upon reevaluation:
- The analysis holds consistent because both the query and Article 419 address scenarios where an obligor's failure to meet a monetary obligation cannot be defended against by claiming force majeure, directly supporting the conclusion that (query entails B1) and (query agree R1).

 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal context and query step by step according to the instructions.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text discusses scenarios under which a performer may deposit the subject matter of performance with an official depository for the benefit of the obligee, including when the obligee refuses to accept the tendered performance and when excessive expenses are required for preserving the thing that is the subject matter of the performance.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: A performer may deposit the subject matter of the performance with an official depository if the obligee refuses to accept it, leading to the extinction of the claim.
- **Rule 2**: The performer may sell the thing at a public auction and deposit the proceeds with an official depository, with court permission, in cases where excessive expenses are required for preservation.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The obligee must refuse to accept the performance tendered by the performer.
- **Condition 2**: Excessive expenses are required for the preservation of the thing that is the subject matter of the performance.
- **Condition 3**: Court permission is needed for selling the thing at a public auction.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence 1**: The claim is extinguished when the performer makes the deposit after the obligee's refusal to accept the performance.
- **Consequence 2**: The proceeds from the sale of the thing are deposited with an official depository, potentially leading to the fulfillment of the obligation under different terms.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- No explicit exceptions are mentioned in the provided text that directly alter these rules without adding new conditions or scenarios for application.

### Output Format

**Rule(s)**: 
1. A performer can deposit the performance subject with an official depository if the obligee refuses to accept it.
2. The performer may sell the thing at a public auction and deposit the proceeds under certain conditions.

**Condition(s)**:
1. Obligee's refusal to accept the tendered performance.
2. Excessive preservation expenses for the subject matter.
3. Court permission for public auction sale.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
1. Extinction of the claim upon deposit after refusal.
2. Deposit of sale proceeds as an alternative fulfillment.

**Exception(s)**: None explicitly stated in relation to altering these outcomes without additional conditions.

Given this breakdown and considering the query, "A performer tendered the performance, and the obligee refused to accept it. In this case, if excessive expenses are required for the preservation of the thing, the performer may, with the permission of the court, sell the thing that is the subject matter of performance at a public auction and deposit the proceeds of such sales with an official depository."

- The query **entails base-level factor B1** because it considers a scenario where the obligee refuses to accept the performance (Condition 1) and also involves excessive expenses for preservation (Condition 2), aligning with the evidence in similar situations.
  
- The query **agrees with root R1** since both address scenarios where the performer can deposit or sell the subject matter under specific conditions, including refusal by the obligee and the need for court permission due to excessive preservation costs.

Upon careful consideration and rejustification:

- **(query entails B1)**: Yes, because it directly relates to the conditions outlined (obligee's refusal and excessive preservation expenses).
  
- **(query agree R1)**: Yes, as both the query and the root principle (R1) support the performer's action under specified conditions without contradicting each other.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text is about the disposition after the termination of a mandate. Specifically, Article 654 states that if a mandate has terminated but there are pressing circumstances, the mandatary or their heir/legal representative must take necessary actions until the mandator or their heir/legal representative can take charge of the mandated business.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle here is:
- If a mandate terminates due to any reason (including the death of the mandator), and there are pressing circumstances, the responsibility for managing the mandated business temporarily falls on the mandatary or their representatives until the rightful party can take over.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which this rule applies include:
- The termination of a mandate.
- The existence of pressing circumstances that require immediate action.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that the mandatary or their heir/legal representative must effect the necessary actions to manage the mandated business until it can be transferred to the rightful party.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicitly stated exceptions in the provided text. The rule seems to apply universally under the conditions of mandate termination and pressing circumstances.

### Output Format
Given the analysis, we have:
- **Rule(s):** If a mandate terminates due to any reason (including the death of the mandator), and there are pressing circumstances, the responsibility for managing the mandated business temporarily falls on the mandatary or their representatives.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Termination of a mandate.
  - Existence of pressing circumstances.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The mandatary or their heir/legal representative must manage the mandated business until it can be transferred to the rightful party.
- **Exception(s):** None explicitly stated.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the analysis, let's consider how this applies to the query:
- The query states: "Even if the mandate contract has terminated due to the death of the mandator, if there are pressing circumstances, the mandatary must effect the necessary actions until the time when the heir of the mandator is able to take charge of the mandated business."
- This scenario directly aligns with the conditions and consequences outlined in Article 654.

### Justification
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The query does indeed consider a specific situation where the mandate terminates due to the death of the mandator, which aligns with one of the conditions for applying the rule. Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.
- **Root Node (R1):** The root node represents the general principle that in cases of mandate termination and pressing circumstances, the mandatary must act until the rightful party can take over. The query presents a scenario that is entirely consistent with this principle, as it specifies a situation where the mandatary must continue to manage the business after the mandator's death due to pressing circumstances. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After careful consideration and re-justification, these conclusions hold true based on the provided analysis and the structure of the legal argument presented in both the article and the query.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text provided is from Article 487, which discusses the return of an instrument evidencing a claim after full performance has been made.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule:** If there is an instrument that serves as evidence for a claim and the person responsible for making the payment (the performer) completes their obligation in full, they have the right to request the return of this instrument.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** There must be an instrument evidencing a claim.
- **Condition 2:** The person making the performance must have completed it in full.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence:** Upon completing their performance, the performer may demand the return of the instrument.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- No explicit exceptions are mentioned in the provided text.

### 6. Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** The rule is that a person who has completed their performance related to an instrument evidencing a claim may demand its return.
- **Condition(s):** 
  - There exists an instrument evidencing a claim.
  - Full performance of the obligation has been made by the performer.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The performer has the right to request the return of the instrument upon completion of their performance.
- **Exception(s):** None are explicitly stated.

Regarding the query: "In cases where there is any instrument which evidences the claim for wages, the borrower may assert the fact that he/she will make a payment by returning and exchanging the instrument when attempting to make the performance has completed his/her entire performance."

### Analysis of Query in Relation to Base-Level Factors and Root Node
- The query involves an instrument evidencing a claim (in this case, for wages), which aligns with the conditions set forth in Article 487.
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The presence of an instrument evidencing a claim is a base-level factor relevant to the scenario described by both the article and the query. Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.
- Considering the root node (let's denote it as R1) related to demanding the return of an instrument upon full performance, the query seems to align with the principle outlined in Article 487 but introduces a nuance regarding wages and the process of making payment through returning and exchanging the instrument. However, both the article and the query ultimately support the idea that completion of performance leads to the right to request the return of the instrument. Hence, **(query agree R1)**.

Upon careful reconsideration:
- The query's focus on wages and the method of payment (returning and exchanging the instrument) as part of completing performance does not fundamentally alter the agreement with the root principle that full performance entitles one to demand the return of the instrument.
- Therefore, the initial assessment stands: **(query entails B1)** and **(query agree R1)**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break down the provided legal context and query according to the instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes two articles from a civil legal code:
- Article 415 discusses the compensatory claims an obligee can make if an obligor fails to perform their obligations.
- Article 561 specifically addresses sales where the subject matter is another person's right, stating that the seller must acquire and transfer this right to the buyer.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
1. **Rule**: An obligee can claim compensation for losses if an obligor fails to perform their obligations as intended.
2. **Rule**: A seller who sells another person's rights is obligated to acquire those rights and transfer them to the buyer.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- For Article 415, the condition is that the failure to perform must not be due to grounds not attributable to the obligor.
- For Article 561, the condition is that the subject matter of the sale is another person's right.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- The legal consequence of Article 415 is that the obligee may claim compensation for losses.
- The legal consequence of Article 561 is that the seller bears the obligation to acquire and transfer the rights to the buyer.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- An exception in Article 415 is if the failure to perform is due to grounds not attributable to the obligor.
- There's no explicit exception mentioned in Article 561, but the query introduces a scenario where the buyer knows the rights don't belong to the seller at the time of the contract.

### Step 6: Output Format
**Rule(s)**:
1. An obligee can claim compensation for losses if an obligor fails to perform as intended.
2. A seller must acquire and transfer another person's rights when selling them.

**Condition(s)**:
1. The failure must not be due to non-attributable grounds (Article 415).
2. The sale involves another person's rights (Article 561).

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
1. The obligee may claim compensation for losses.
2. The seller must acquire and transfer the rights.

**Exception(s)**:
1. If the failure is due to non-attributable grounds, no compensation can be claimed (Article 415).
2. Knowing the rights don't belong to the seller at the contract's inception does not preclude a claim for damages (as per the query).

Given this analysis and moving on to the justification regarding the ANGELIC structure:

- **Root Node (R)**: The primary legal determination here revolves around the obligations of sellers when dealing with intangible goods like rights, and the compensatory measures available to buyers in cases of non-performance.
- **Abstract Factors**: These could include concepts like "good faith" in contractual agreements or the principle of "pacta sunt servanda" (agreements must be kept).
- **Base-Level Factors (B)**: Specific scenarios like a buyer knowing they're purchasing non-transferable rights, or a seller failing to deliver due to unforeseen circumstances.

The query specifically addresses a scenario where a buyer is aware that the rights being sold do not belong to the seller. This directly pertains to the conditions under which a seller's obligations are considered breached and thus, relates to **Base-Level Factors** because it deals with a specific application of the rules outlined in Article 561.

Therefore, we can say: **(query entails B1)**, as the query is considering evidence in a similar situation or scenario related to Base-Level Factor B1, which could be defined as "a buyer's knowledge of a seller's inability to transfer rights at the time of contract."

Regarding agreement with the root node (R), if we consider R1 to represent the principle that buyers have recourse for damages when sellers fail to perform their obligations, especially in cases involving the sale of intangible rights:

- The query **(agree R1)** because it suggests that even knowing the seller cannot transfer the rights, the buyer does not lose their right to claim damages. This aligns with the root principle that non-performance by a seller (in this case, failure to acquire and transfer rights) can lead to compensatory claims by the buyer.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of contractual law and the specifics of Article 561, the conclusion remains consistent: The query does indeed pertain to Base-Level Factors due to its scenario-specific nature and agrees with the root principle that buyers have avenues for seeking damages in cases of non-performance by sellers.

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes two articles from a civil legal code: Article 617 regarding lease agreements without specified terms and Article 591 concerning the return of borrowed items. The query discusses scenarios where parties do not specify terms for leases or loans, focusing on responsibilities and liabilities regarding termination and return of items.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: If parties do not specify a lease term, either party can terminate at any time with notice, and the lease ends after a prescribed period.
- **Rule 2**: For borrowed items without a specified return time, the lender can demand return within a reasonable period, and the borrower may return at any time.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition for Rule 1**: The lease agreement does not specify its term.
- **Condition for Rule 2**: There is no defined time for returning borrowed items.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence of Rule 1**: Either party can terminate the lease with notice, and the termination takes effect after a certain period.
- **Consequence of Rule 2**: The lender can demand return within a reasonable timeframe, or the borrower may return the item at any time.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception for Leases with Harvest Seasons**: Notice must be given after the harvest season ends and before the next cultivation begins.
- **Exception for Returning Borrowed Items Early**: If returned early, the lender may claim compensation if they suffer damage.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the structured analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: 
    - Either party can terminate a lease without a specified term with notice.
    - The lender can demand return of borrowed items within a reasonable time if no return time is set.
- **Condition(s)**:
    - Lease agreements without specified terms.
    - Borrowed items without defined return times.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**:
    - Termination of lease after notice period.
    - Return of borrowed items upon demand or at borrower's discretion.
- **Exception(s)**:
    - Special timing for leases involving harvest seasons.
    - Potential compensation if returning borrowed items early causes damage.

### Justification
Given the query and the base-level factors identified in the rules, conditions, consequences, and exceptions:
- The query discusses responsibilities during lease terminations and item returns without specified terms, directly relating to **Rule 1** and **Rule 2**.
- Therefore, (query entails B1), as it considers evidence in similar situations or scenarios regarding leases and borrowed items without defined terms.

### Agreement with Root
The root node R1 could be considered the principle that either party can terminate a lease without a term with notice, and lenders can demand return of items within a reasonable time. The query seems to explore the implications of these principles on responsibilities during terminations and returns.
- Given this, (query agree R1), as both discuss scenarios where parties have flexibility in terminating leases or returning borrowed items due to unspecified terms.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation:
- The query indeed aligns with exploring the consequences of lease terminations and item returns without predefined terms, which directly ties into the base-level factors identified.
- Thus, (query entails B1) remains accurate.
- Furthermore, considering the root node's focus on the flexibility in terminating leases or returning items due to unspecified terms, the query agrees with this principle by exploring its implications on responsibilities.
- Hence, (query agree R1) also holds true upon rejustification.

Output:
(query entails B1)
(query agree R1)

 To address the given task, let's break down the legal article context step by step according to the instructions provided.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text is Article 423-6, which states: "If the obligee files an action concerning the exercise of the subrogor's right, the obligee must give a notice of suit to the obligor without delay."

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The rule can be stated as: The obligee is required to notify the obligor when taking legal action related to the subrogor's rights.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The condition for this rule is: If the obligee files an action concerning the exercise of the subrogor's right.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is: The obligee must give a notice of suit to the obligor without delay.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no exceptions or limitations mentioned in the provided text.

### 6. Output Format
Given the analysis, we can summarize as follows:

- **Rule(s):** The obligee must notify the obligor when taking legal action related to the subrogor's rights.
- **Condition(s):** If the obligee files an action concerning the exercise of the subrogor's right.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The obligee must give a notice of suit to the obligor without delay.
- **Exception(s):** None mentioned.

Now, addressing the query in relation to the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:

The query "If the obligee files an action concerning the exercise of the subrogor's right, the obligee must give a notice of suit to the obligor without delay" directly reflects the condition and legal consequence outlined in Article 423-6. This means it is considering the evidence in a similar situation or scenario as described by the base-level factor related to the notification requirement when an action is filed concerning subrogor's rights.

Therefore, **(query entails B1)**, where B1 represents the base-level factor of notifying the obligor when filing an action regarding the exercise of the subrogor's right.

Given that there's a direct match between the query and the rule (including its condition and consequence) without any exceptions or disagreements:

**(query agree R1)**, where R1 is the root node representing the primary legal determination that the obligee must notify the obligor under the specified conditions. 

Upon rejustification, considering the exact wording of the query matches the scenario described in Article 423-6 and leads to the same legal consequence without any mentioned exceptions or alternative interpretations:

The conclusion remains that **(query entails B1)** and **(query agree R1)**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break down the provided legal context and query according to the instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes Article 613, which discusses the rights and liabilities between lessors, lessees, and sublessees in a lease agreement. It also mentions a query about the return of a deposit for consumption of money.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
From Article 613:
1. A sublessee is liable to perform obligations directly to the lessor within the scope of the lessee's obligations.
2. The lessor can exercise rights against the lessee despite the sublease.
3. The lessor cannot assert cancellation of the lease against the sublessee unless there was non-performance by the lessee.

From the query:
- A depositor cannot demand the return of money without issuing a notice specifying a reasonable period.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
Article 613 conditions:
- The lessee must have lawfully subleased the leased thing.
- The lessor has a right to cancel due to non-performance by the lessee for certain assertions against the sublessee.

Query condition:
- The parties do not define the time for return in a contract for value of deposit for consumption of money.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
Article 613 consequences:
- The sublessee is directly liable to the lessor.
- The lessor retains rights against the lessee.
- Cancellation by agreement between the lessor and lessee does not affect the sublessee unless there was non-performance.

Query consequence:
- The depositor can demand the return of money after issuing a notice with a reasonable period.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
Article 613 exceptions:
- The lessor's right to assert cancellation against the sublessee if there was non-performance by the lessee.
- Advance payment of rent may not be asserted against the lessor in certain cases.

Query exception:
- The need for a notice with a reasonable period before demanding the return of money.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the complexity and the specific request, let's summarize:

Rule(s):
1. Sublessees are liable to lessors within the scope of lessee obligations.
2. Lessors can exercise rights against lessees despite subleases.
3. Depositors must issue a notice for return of deposits.

Condition(s):
1. Lawful subleasing.
2. Non-performance by the lessee for certain assertions.
3. Undefined return time in deposit contracts.

Legal Consequence(s):
1. Direct liability of sublessees to lessors.
2. Retained rights of lessors against lessees.
3. Depositors can demand returns after notice.

Exception(s):
1. Lessor's right to assert cancellation due to non-performance.
2. Requirement for notice before demanding deposit return.

Now, addressing the query and its relation to base-level factors and roots:

The query discusses a scenario involving deposits and their return, which is distinct from the lease agreements in Article 613 but shares a common thread of contractual obligations and the necessity of specific actions (like notices) to enforce certain rights. 

Considering the Angelic Structure Formation Criteria:
- **Root Node (R)**: The primary determination could be about contractual obligations and the enforcement thereof.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships**: Nodes could represent different aspects like lease agreements, deposit contracts, notice requirements, and their interrelations based on supporting or denying relationships.

**Node Naming Convention** might label the root node as R1 for contractual obligations, abstract factors as A1 for notice requirements, and base-level factors as B1 for specific scenarios like lease agreements or deposit returns.

Given this framework:
- The query entails a Base-Level Factor because it considers evidence in similar situations of contractual obligations and enforcement, which can be labeled as (query entails B1).
- Comparing the query with the most comparable root (R1) regarding contractual obligations and notice requirements, we see that both the query and R1 agree on the necessity of specific actions (like notices) for enforcing rights in contractual scenarios. Thus, (query agrees R1).

After careful reconsideration:
The conclusion remains consistent with the initial analysis based on the provided instructions and framework.

 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal context step by step according to the instructions.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text discusses Article 715 of a civil code, focusing on the liability of employers and supervisors for damages caused by employees during the execution of business. It outlines conditions under which this liability applies and mentions the possibility of reimbursement against the employee.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** An employer is liable to compensate for damage inflicted on a third party by their employees in the course of business execution.
- **Rule 2:** A supervisor also bears similar liability for damages caused during the supervision of the business on behalf of the employer.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** The employer or supervisor must have exercised reasonable care in appointing the employee or supervising the business to avoid liability.
- **Condition 2:** The damage could not have been avoided even if the employer or supervisor had exercised reasonable care, which would also negate liability.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence 1:** If conditions for liability are met, the employer or supervisor is liable to compensate for damages.
- **Legal Consequence 2:** The employer or supervisor may seek reimbursement from the employee who caused the damage.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1:** Liability does not apply if the employer or supervisor exercised reasonable care and the damage was unavoidable.
- **Exception 2:** The provisions do not prevent the employer or supervisor from seeking reimbursement from the employee, indicating that liability can be shared or transferred under certain conditions.

### 6. Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** Employer and supervisor liability for employee actions during business execution.
- **Condition(s):** Exercise of reasonable care; unavoidability of damage despite reasonable care.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** Liability for damages; potential reimbursement from the employee.
- **Exception(s):** Reasonable care exercised and damage unavoidable; right to seek reimbursement.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Let's consider the query in light of this structure:
- The query discusses a scenario where a plaintiff seeks compensation based on the liability of an agent supervisor (under Article 715, Paragraph 2) for damages caused by person A's tortious acts. The defendant (agent supervisor) claims they could not have avoided the damage despite exercising reasonable care.

### Justification
- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query entails a base-level factor because it considers evidence in a similar situation or scenario where an agent supervisor's liability is questioned based on their duty of care. Thus, **(query entails B1)**.
- **Agreement with Root:** Considering the most comparable root (the principle of employer/supervisor liability under Article 715), the query and the root agree that if reasonable care was exercised and the damage was unavoidable, the supervisor might not be liable. This implies a similar verdict in a comparable situation, suggesting **(query agree R1)**.

After re-justification, considering the specifics of the query and the legal context provided:
- The conclusion remains that the query entails a base-level factor related to the exercise of reasonable care by an agent supervisor.
- There's agreement with the root principle concerning liability under Article 715, especially regarding the conditions for liability and the potential for avoiding liability if reasonable care was exercised.

Thus, the final justification confirms **(query entails B1)** and **(query agree R1)**.

 To address the problem, let's break down the legal context and query according to the instructions provided.


## Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses the conditions under which an obligee can demand the rescission of a fraudulent act by the obligor. This includes knowing that the act will prejudice the obligee and that the beneficiary of the act is aware of this potential prejudice.

## Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** An obligee may demand the court to rescind an act by the obligor if it prejudices the obligee, provided the beneficiary knows about the potential prejudice.
- **Rule 2:** This rule does not apply to acts involving subjects other than property rights.
- **Rule 3:** The obligee's claim must have arisen before the act in question and be enforceable by compulsory execution for the demand to be valid.

## Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** The obligor must know that their act will prejudice the obligee.
- **Condition 2:** The beneficiary of the act must also be aware of the potential prejudice to the obligee at the time of the act.
- **Condition 3:** The subject matter of the act must involve property rights.
- **Condition 4:** The obligee's claim must have a cause predating the act in question.
- **Condition 5:** The obligee's claim must be enforceable by compulsory execution.

## Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence of meeting these conditions is that the obligee can demand the rescission of the fraudulent act, potentially nullifying its effects.

## Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1:** If the beneficiary does not know about the prejudice at the time of the act, the rule does not apply.
- **Exception 2:** Acts with subjects other than property rights are exempt from this rule.

## Step 6: Output Format
**Rule(s):**
1. An obligee can demand rescission if an act by the obligor prejudices them and the beneficiary is aware of this prejudice.
2. The subject must involve property rights.
3. The claim must predate the act and be enforceable.

**Condition(s):**
1. Obligor's knowledge of prejudice.
2. Beneficiary's awareness of potential prejudice.
3. Property rights involvement.
4. Pre-existing cause for the claim.
5. Claim must be enforceable by compulsory execution.

**Legal Consequence(s):**
The obligee can demand rescission of the act if conditions are met.

**Exception(s):**
1. Lack of beneficiary's knowledge at the time of the act.
2. Acts not involving property rights.


Given the query: Assume A has a claim against B for 20 million yen, and B gives land to G knowing it will prejudice A, but A and B agreed not to carry out compulsory execution.

**(query entails B1)** because both consider a scenario where an obligor (B) takes an action (giving land to G) that prejudices the obligee (A), involving property rights and awareness of prejudice by the beneficiary (G).

**(query disagree R1)** because, in the comparable situation, the root node (R1) suggests the obligee can demand rescission if all conditions are met. However, the query presents a scenario where A cannot make this demand due to the agreement not to pursue compulsory execution, which directly contradicts one of the necessary conditions for demanding rescission as outlined in Rule 3 and Condition 5.

After re-justification, considering the specifics of the query and the rules provided:
- The key point is that A and B agreed not to carry out compulsory execution, which aligns with Condition 5 (the claim must be enforceable by compulsory execution) being violated.
- Therefore, despite the presence of other necessary conditions (e.g., knowledge of prejudice, property rights involvement), the absence of enforceability by compulsory execution due to agreement is crucial.

Thus, **(query disagree R1)** holds because the query's scenario specifically highlights a condition (enforceability by compulsory execution) that is not met, leading to a disagreement with the root node's general principle that allows for rescission under different circumstances.

 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's follow the step-by-step process outlined:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The provided text includes Article 296, Article 301, and Article 350, which discuss the right of retention and its application to pledges.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** A holder of a right of retention can exercise their rights against the whole of the thing retained until the relevant claim is satisfied in its entirety.
- **Rule 2:** An obligor may demand that a right of retention be terminated by providing a reasonable security.
- **Rule 3:** The provisions regarding rights of retention also apply to pledges, indicating a principle of mutatis mutandis application.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** For Rule 1, the condition is that the holder has a right of retention and there's an unsatisfied claim.
- **Condition 2:** For Rule 2, the obligor must be able to provide a reasonable security to demand the termination of the right of retention.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence 1:** The holder can retain the thing until the claim is fully satisfied.
- **Consequence 2:** The right of retention can be terminated if the obligor provides a reasonable security.
- **Consequence 3:** Pledges are subject to similar provisions as rights of retention.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- There's an implied exception where partial satisfaction of the claim does not terminate the right of retention due to its indivisibility, but offering collateral can lead to its expiration for a right of retention.

### Output Format
Rule(s):
1. A holder of a right of retention can exercise their rights until the relevant claim is fully satisfied.
2. An obligor may demand termination of the right by providing reasonable security.
3. Provisions for rights of retention apply mutatis mutandis to pledges.

Condition(s):
1. Unsatisfied claim for exercising right of retention.
2. Ability to provide reasonable security for terminating the right.

Legal Consequence(s):
1. Right to retain until full satisfaction of the claim.
2. Termination of right of retention upon provision of reasonable security.
3. Application of similar provisions to pledges.

Exception(s):
Partial claim satisfaction does not expire the right due to indivisibility, but collateral can lead to expiration for rights of retention.

### Justification
Given the query: "A right of retention and a pledge do not expire by just satisfying his/her a portion of the secured claim due to their indivisibility, but for a right of retention, the obligor may demand the expiration of the right by offering appropriate collateral."

- The query **entails Base-Level Factor B1**, as it discusses the scenario where partial satisfaction does not terminate the right of retention or pledge, aligning with the conditions and consequences outlined.
  
- The query **agrees with Root R1** regarding the indivisibility principle and the effect of partial claim satisfaction but also introduces a specific condition (offering collateral) that leads to the expiration of the right of retention, which is in line with Rule 2 identified from Article 301.

Thus, after careful analysis:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

This justification is based on understanding the rules regarding rights of retention and pledges, their conditions, consequences, and exceptions as outlined in the provided articles.

 To address the given task, let's break down the legal context provided and analyze it step by step according to the instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses provisions related to mandatary contracts, specifically focusing on when a mandatary can claim remuneration from the mandator. It covers general rules, conditions for claiming remuneration, and exceptions to these conditions.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
1. **General Rule**: A mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator in the absence of special agreements.
2. **Remuneration Timing**: If a mandatary is to receive remuneration, they generally cannot claim it until after performing the mandated business.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition for Remuneration Claim**: The mandatary must have performed the mandated business unless specified otherwise by special agreements or under specific conditions like termination of the mandate.
- **Special Condition for Periodic Remuneration**: If remuneration is specified with reference to a period, different provisions apply (as per Article 624, paragraph (2)).
- **Exceptional Conditions for Proportional Remuneration**:
  - The mandatary can no longer perform due to grounds not attributable to the mandator.
  - The mandate is terminated during performance.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **General Outcome**: A mandatary cannot claim remuneration before performing the mandated business unless under specific conditions or agreements.
- **Specific Outcomes**:
  - Remuneration can be claimed after completing the mandated business.
  - In cases of termination or inability to perform not due to the mandator, remuneration may be claimed proportionally.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception for Periodic Remuneration**: Applies if the remuneration is specified with reference to a period.
- **Exceptions for Proportional Remuneration**: In cases of termination or inability to perform due to reasons not attributable to the mandator.

### Step 6: Output Format
**Rule(s)**:
1. A mandatary cannot claim remuneration without special agreements.
2. Remuneration is generally claimed after performance.

**Condition(s)**:
- Performance of the mandated business.
- Special agreements or conditions (e.g., periodic remuneration, termination).

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
- Mandataries can claim remuneration after performing the mandated business or under specific conditions.

**Exception(s)**:
- Periodic remuneration has different rules.
- Proportional remuneration in case of mandate termination or inability to perform due to non-attributable reasons.

### Justification
Given the query "A mandatary of a quasi-mandate contract may not claim remuneration from a mandator before performance, even with special agreements that a mandatary may claim remuneration before he/she administers the mandated business," we can analyze its relation to the base-level factors and roots identified.

- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor**: The query specifically addresses conditions under which a mandatary can or cannot claim remuneration, which aligns with the base-level factor related to the timing of remuneration claims (considering evidence in similar situations). Thus, **(query entails B1)**.
  
- **Agreement with Root**: The root principle identified is that a mandatary generally cannot claim remuneration before performing the mandated business. The query seems to support this principle by stating that even special agreements may not allow for claiming remuneration before performance in quasi-mandate contracts, suggesting an agreement with the root principle. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After re-justification, considering the specifics of the legal context and the phrasing of the query, it appears there might have been an oversight in the initial interpretation regarding special agreements and their impact on claiming remuneration before performance. The query suggests a scenario where special agreements may not override the general principle for quasi-mandate contracts, aligning with the identified rules but potentially misunderstanding the nuances of "special agreements" as described. However, based on the provided instructions and the direct analysis of the given texts, the justification stands as initially concluded.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's follow the step-by-step process outlined:

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text provided is about Article 708, which discusses the denial of a claim for return due to illegal causes.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule**: A person who has paid money or delivered something for an obligation based on an illegal cause cannot demand its return.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition**: The rule applies unless the illegal cause existed solely in relation to the beneficiary.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence**: If the condition is met without the exception, the person cannot demand a return of the money paid or thing delivered.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception**: The rule does not apply if the illegal cause existed solely in relation to the beneficiary, meaning the person can demand a return under this specific circumstance.

### Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s)**: A person who has paid money or delivered something for an obligation based on an illegal cause cannot demand its return.
- **Condition(s)**: The illegal cause of the obligation.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**: The person cannot demand a return of the money paid or thing delivered if the condition is met without exception.
- **Exception(s)**: If the illegal cause existed solely in relation to the beneficiary, the rule does not apply.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Let's assign nodes based on the criteria:
- **R1 (Root Node)**: A person cannot demand a return of money or things paid/delivered for an illegal cause.
- **A1 (Abstract Factor)**: The existence of an illegal cause in obligations.
- **B1 (Base-Level Factor)**: The illegal cause existed solely in relation to the beneficiary.

### Justification
The query "A person that has paid money or delivered thing for an obligation for an illegal cause may not demand the return of the money paid or thing delivered, even if the illegal cause existed solely in relation to the beneficiary" directly contradicts the exception stated in Article 708. Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**: Because it discusses a scenario involving the existence of an illegal cause solely in relation to the beneficiary.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query directly opposes the root node's stance by suggesting that even with the exception (illegal cause existing solely in relation to the beneficiary), a person cannot demand a return, which contradicts the rule's exception.

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and the arguments presented:
- The query indeed involves **B1** as it talks about the scenario where the illegal cause is related to the beneficiary.
- However, the disagreement with **R1** stems from misinterpreting the exception. The correct interpretation should align with the legal principle that if the illegal cause exists solely in relation to the beneficiary, the rule against demanding a return does not apply. Thus, the query's assertion that one cannot demand a return even in this case actually **disagrees** with the nuanced stance of **R1**, which allows for an exception under specific circumstances.

Therefore, the final assessment remains:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** A possessor of a thing belonging to another person may retain that thing until their claim related to it is satisfied.
- **Rule 2:** The provisions of retention do not apply if possession commenced by means of a tortious act.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** The possessor must have a claim that has arisen in relation to the thing they possess.
- **Condition 2:** The relevant claim must have fallen due for the right of retention to apply.
- **Condition 3:** Possession must not have commenced by means of a tortious act.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence:** The possessor may retain the thing belonging to another until their claim is satisfied, provided conditions are met.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1:** If the relevant claim has not yet fallen due, the right of retention does not apply.
- **Exception 2:** If possession commenced by means of a tortious act, the provisions regarding the right of retention do not apply.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** 
  - A possessor may retain a thing belonging to another if they have a claim related to it.
  - The right of retention does not apply for possession commenced by tortious acts.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Existence of a claim related to the possessed thing.
  - Claim must have fallen due.
  - Possession not commenced by a tortious act.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** 
  - The possessor may retain the thing until their claim is satisfied if conditions are met.
- **Exception(s):**
  - Claims not yet due do not allow for retention.
  - Tortious commencement of possession negates the right of retention.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
For simplicity, let's label the root node related to the right of retention as R1 and abstract factors or base-level factors accordingly. 

- **R1 (Root Node):** The possessor has a right of retention under certain conditions.
- **A1 (Abstract Factor):** Conditions for the right of retention.
  - **B1 (Base-Level Factor):** Existence of a claim related to the thing possessed.
  - **B2 (Base-Level Factor):** Claim must have fallen due.
  - **B3 (Base-Level Factor):** Possession not commenced by tortious acts.

### Query Analysis
The query mentions that for the formation of rights of retention, existence of a claim with respect to the subject matter and possession of the subject matter by the obligee are required, but it is not required that the obligee possess the subject matter at the time of the formation of the claim.

- **(query entails B1):** Yes, because both consider the necessity of a claim related to the possessed thing for the right of retention.
- **(query agree R1):** Yes, because both agree on the principle that certain conditions (like the existence of a claim) must be met for the right of retention to apply. The query does not introduce any disagreement with the root node's general principle regarding the conditions under which the right of retention is applicable.

Upon re-justification, it seems the initial analysis correctly aligns the query with both a base-level factor (B1) and agrees with the root node (R1) concerning the necessity of certain conditions for the right of retention to apply. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
**(query entails B1)** 
**(query agree R1)**

 Let's break down the given text and query according to the provided instructions.


### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes two articles, Article 564 and Article 565, which discuss the provisions related to a buyer's rights in case of non-conforming transfers by the seller. The query presents a scenario where the buyer is aware at the time of the contract that the rights being sold do not belong to the seller.


### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
1. **Rule**: A buyer can claim compensation for loss or damage if the seller fails to transfer the right as per the contract terms, despite knowing about the non-conformity.
2. **Rule**: The provisions apply when the transferred right does not conform to the contract terms, including cases where the seller fails to transfer part of a right belonging to another person.


### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition**: The buyer knows at the moment of the contract that the rights bought do not belong to the seller.
- **Condition**: The seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights to the buyer.


### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence**: The buyer may claim compensation or exercise the right to cancel the contract under certain conditions.
- **Legal Consequence**: In the query's scenario, it suggests that if the buyer knows the seller cannot transfer the rights at the time of the contract, the seller may not cancel the contract.


### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception**: The provisions allowing for compensation or cancellation do not apply if the buyer was aware of the non-conformity and still proceeded with the contract, as implied by the query.


### Step 6: Output Format
Given the structured analysis:

**Rule(s)**:
1. A buyer can claim compensation or cancel the contract if the seller fails to transfer rights as per the contract.
2. Provisions apply when the transferred right does not conform to the contract terms.

**Condition(s)**:
- The buyer's knowledge at the time of the contract about the non-conformity.
- The seller's inability to acquire and transfer the rights.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
- The buyer may claim compensation or cancel the contract under certain conditions.
- The seller may not cancel the contract if the buyer was aware of the issue at the time of contracting.

**Exception(s)**:
- Awareness of non-conformity by the buyer at the time of the contract might limit the buyer's ability to later claim compensation or cancel.


### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria Justification
Given the query and the angelic structure criteria, we need to determine if the query entails a Base-Level Factor (B1) and if it agrees or disagrees with the Root Node (R1).

- **Query Entails B1**: Yes, because both the query and the base-level factor consider scenarios where the buyer's knowledge at the contract time affects their rights regarding non-conforming transfers.
  
- **Query Agree/Disagree R1**: The query seems to disagree with R1. R1 suggests that a buyer can claim compensation or cancel if the seller fails to transfer rights as per the contract. However, the query implies that if the buyer knows at the time of the contract that the seller cannot transfer the rights (because they don't belong to the seller), then the seller may not cancel the contract. This seems to introduce a condition where the buyer's prior knowledge limits their later actions, which could be seen as disagreeing with the general principle allowing for compensation or cancellation under non-conformity.


Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagree R1)**


Upon careful reconsideration, it appears that the initial interpretation may have overlooked the nuances of how the query and the root node interact with the base-level factors. The critical aspect is understanding how the buyer's knowledge affects their rights and the applicability of the contract provisions. Thus, the justification provided aligns with the instructions for analyzing legal argument structures and applying the ANGELIC criteria.

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text states, "Article 677 A partner's creditor may not exercise the rights of that creditor against the partnership property."

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- The rule is that a partner's creditor cannot use their rights against the partnership's assets.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- There are no explicitly stated conditions like "if," "when," or "provided that" in the given article. The rule applies generally to all partners' creditors regarding partnership property.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- The legal consequence is that a partner's creditor does not have the right to exercise their claims against the partnership's property.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- There are no exceptions mentioned in the given article. It presents a straightforward rule without any specified limitations.

### Output Format
Given the analysis, we can summarize as follows:

Rule(s): A partner's creditor cannot exercise their rights against the partnership property.
Condition(s): None explicitly stated.
Legal Consequence(s): The creditor does not have the right to claim against the partnership assets.
Exception(s): None mentioned.

Now, comparing this with the query: "A partner's creditor may exercise the rights of that creditor against the partnership property to the extent of the partner’s interest."

### Justification
- The query suggests a condition ("to the extent of the partner’s interest") under which a partner's creditor can exercise their rights against the partnership property, which directly contrasts with the rule stated in Article 677.
- This indicates the query introduces a base-level factor (let's label it B1) that considers the extent of the partner's interest as a condition for exercising creditor rights.
- Thus, we can say: (query entails B1).
  
Given the introduction of this condition and its contrast with the original rule:
- The query disagrees with the root (R1), which states that a partner's creditor may not exercise their rights against the partnership property without any conditions.
- Therefore, we conclude: (query disagree R1).

Upon rejustification, considering the explicit mention of "to the extent of the partner’s interest" in the query, it indeed presents a scenario where the creditor's ability to exercise rights is conditional and limited. This directly opposes the unconditional prohibition stated in Article 677, reinforcing our conclusion that the query introduces a base-level factor (B1) and disagrees with the root rule (R1).

 To analyze the given legal context and query, let's follow the step-by-step instructions provided:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text includes several articles related to civil law, specifically concerning ownership, accession, and compensation for loss due to the application of these provisions.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: If two or more movable properties with different owners can no longer be separated without damage due to accession, the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property.
- **Rule 2**: A person who has benefited from the property or labor of another person without legal cause and has thereby caused a loss to another person bears the duty to return that benefit.
- **Rule 3**: Provisions regarding accession apply mutatis mutandis (with necessary modifications) if things of different owners are mixed together and can no longer be distinguished.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The movable properties cannot be separated without damage.
- **Condition 2**: Excessive expense is required to separate the movables.
- **Condition 3**: Things of different owners are mixed and can no longer be distinguished.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence 1**: The ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property.
- **Consequence 2**: A person who has benefited without legal cause must return the benefit, potentially with interest and compensation for any remaining damage.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1**: If the beneficiary is in bad faith, they must return the benefit with interest, and compensate for any remaining damage.
- **Exception 2**: The provisions apply mutatis mutandis to mixed goods that cannot be distinguished.

### Output Format
```
Rule(s):
1. Ownership of composite things due to accession belongs to the principal owner.
2. Duty to return benefits obtained without legal cause.
3. Modified application for indistinguishable mixed goods.

Condition(s):
1. Impossible separation without damage.
2. Excessive expense for separation.
3. Mixed goods cannot be distinguished.

Legal Consequence(s):
1. Ownership transfer to the principal owner.
2. Return of benefits with potential interest and compensation.

Exception(s):
1. Bad faith beneficiaries must return benefits with interest and compensate damages.
2. Application to mixed, indistinguishable goods.
```

Given the query: "In cases liquid P (100 cubic meters) owned by A was blended with liquid Q (10 cubic meters) owned by B into liquid R (110 cubic meters) so that they cannot be distinguished and A acquired the ownership of liquid R, B may demand compensation from A in accordance with the provisions of unjust enrichment."

### Analysis
- The query involves **Base-Level Factor B1**: The situation where goods of different owners are mixed and cannot be distinguished, leading to a change in ownership.
- This scenario aligns with **Rule 3** (provisions apply mutatis mutandis for indistinguishable mixed goods) and **Condition 3** (things of different owners are mixed and can no longer be distinguished).
- The query also touches on the concept of unjust enrichment, which is related to **Rule 2** and **Consequence 2**.

### Justification
The query entails a Base-Level Factor considering evidence in a similar situation or scenario: **(query entails B1)**.
Given that the query involves mixed goods and the principle of unjust enrichment (return of benefits obtained without legal cause), it aligns with the general principles outlined, particularly with the concept that a person who has suffered loss due to such mixing may demand compensation. Thus, the query agrees with the root principle regarding compensation for loss due to accession or mixing of goods: **(query agree R1)**.

After re-justification, considering the specific details and the application of civil law principles to mixed goods scenarios, it's clear that the query aligns closely with the legal framework provided, particularly in relation to unjust enrichment and the right to compensation for losses incurred due to the mixing of goods belonging to different owners.

 To address the problem, we first need to break down the given legal context into its constituent parts according to the provided instructions.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text is Article 707, which discusses the scenario where a person not obligated to do so performs an obligation by mistake. It outlines the consequences of such an action under certain conditions.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** A person who performs an obligation by mistake and is not the obligor cannot demand the return of the subject matter of the performance if the obligee, in good faith, has allowed the instrument to be lost, damaged it, waived the security, or lost the claim by prescription.
- **Rule 2:** Despite the above, the person who performed the obligation can still seek reimbursement from the actual obligor.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** The performance of the obligation was done by mistake.
- **Condition 2:** The obligee acted in good faith.
- **Condition 3:** One of the following must have occurred:
  - The instrument was lost.
  - The instrument was damaged.
  - The security was waived.
  - The claim was lost by prescription.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- If Conditions 1, 2, and one of the scenarios in Condition 3 are met, the person who mistakenly performed the obligation cannot demand its return from the obligee. However, they can seek reimbursement from the actual obligor.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception:** The right to reimbursement against the obligor remains unaffected by the conditions that prevent demanding the return of the performance from the obligee.

### Output Format
```
Rule(s):
1. A person not obligated cannot demand return of performance under specific conditions.
2. The performer can seek reimbursement from the actual obligor.

Condition(s):
1. Performance was by mistake.
2. Obligee acted in good faith.
3. Specific scenarios (instrument lost, damaged, security waived, claim lost by prescription).

Legal Consequence(s):
The person cannot demand return but can seek reimbursement from the obligor.

Exception(s):
Right to reimbursement against the obligor is preserved.
```

Given the query: "Performance by a third party is also effective, and thus even if an obligation of another person has been performed by mistake, the person who made the performance cannot demand the return of the performance to the obligee."

### Analysis
- The query aligns with **Rule 1** in stating that a mistaken performer cannot demand the return of the performance. This suggests the query considers similar evidence or scenarios as the base-level factor related to mistaken performance and its consequences.
- Therefore, (query entails B1), where B1 represents the base-level factor concerning the inability to demand return due to mistaken performance under the described conditions.

Regarding agreement with the root:
- The query essentially agrees with **R1** (assuming R1 is the rule that a person not obligated cannot demand the return of performance under specific conditions). Both state that a third party who mistakenly performs an obligation generally cannot demand its return from the obligee.
- Hence, (query agree R1).

After careful reconsideration, the analysis holds. The query's stance on the effectiveness of third-party performance and the inability to demand return aligns with the principles outlined in Article 707, particularly regarding mistaken performances by non-obligors. 

Final Answer:
(query entails B1)
(query agree R1)

 To address the task given, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided to analyze the legal argument structure from the context of Articles 306 and 308 regarding statutory liens.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text outlines conditions under which a person has a statutory lien over the entire assets of an obligor, including expenses for common benefit, employer-employee relationships, funeral expenses, and supply of daily necessaries. Specifically, Article 308 highlights that statutory liens for employer-employee relationships cover salaries and other claims arising from this relationship.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle or rule stated in the text can be summarized as follows:
- A person has a statutory lien over the obligor's assets under specific conditions.
- Statutory liens exist for claims arising from employer-employee relationships, including salaries and related claims.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which the rule applies include:
- The existence of a claim arising from expenses for common benefit, an employer-employee relationship, funeral expenses, or supply of daily necessaries.
- Specifically, for employer-employee relationships, the claim must be related to salaries or other benefits deriving from this relationship.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence or outcome is that the person with a valid claim under these conditions has a statutory lien over the entire assets of the obligor. This means they have a secured interest in the obligor's assets to satisfy their claim.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
No explicit exceptions or limitations are mentioned in the provided text that would alter the general rule or its consequence directly.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** A person has a statutory lien over an obligor's assets for specific claims, including those from employer-employee relationships.
- **Condition(s):** Claims must arise from expenses for common benefit, employer-employee relationships, funeral expenses, or supply of daily necessaries. For employer-employee relationships, claims must relate to salaries or other benefits.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The person with a valid claim has a statutory lien over the obligor's assets.
- **Exception(s):** None explicitly stated.

Regarding the query: "A worker has a statutory lien for the general assets of an employer as collateral for the claim to remuneration that he/she has."
- This query directly relates to the conditions and rules outlined, particularly focusing on employer-employee relationships as a basis for statutory liens.
- The query entails a Base-Level Factor because it considers evidence in a similar situation or scenario (employer-employee relationship) as outlined in Article 308.

Thus, **(query entails B1)**, where B1 represents the base-level factor of an employer-employee relationship being a condition for a statutory lien.

Considering the root node (R1) that a person has a statutory lien over an obligor's assets under specific conditions including employer-employee relationships:
- The query agrees with R1 because both the query and the rule support the notion that workers can have a statutory lien on an employer's general assets for claims related to remuneration.

Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After careful reconsideration, the analysis holds true: the query directly pertains to the scenario described by the rules and conditions outlined in Articles 306 and 308, specifically aligning with the concept of statutory liens for employer-employee relationships. Thus, the conclusion that **(query entails B1)** and **(query agree R1)** remains justified.

 To address the given task, let's break down the legal argument structure from the provided article context step by step.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text has been carefully read and understood.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: If parties have not specified the proportions of distributions of the partnership's profits and losses, these proportions are determined in accordance with the value of each partner's contribution.
- **Rule 2**: If the proportions of distributions have been specified solely with respect to either profits or losses, it is presumed that those proportions are common to both profits and losses.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition for Rule 1**: The parties have not specified the proportions of distributions of the partnership's profits and losses.
- **Condition for Rule 2**: The proportions of distributions have been specified solely with respect to either profits or losses.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence for Rule 1**: The proportions of distributions are determined based on the value of each partner's contribution.
- **Consequence for Rule 2**: The specified proportions for either profits or losses are presumed to apply to both profits and losses.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in the provided text, but Rule 2 can be seen as a specific case or an extension of Rule 1, providing further guidance when only one aspect (profits or losses) is specified.

### Output Format
- **Rule(s)**: 
  - If parties have not specified profit and loss distribution proportions, these are determined by the value of each partner's contribution.
  - If proportions are specified for either profits or losses, they apply to both.
- **Condition(s)**:
  - No specification of profit and loss distribution proportions.
  - Specification of proportions for only one of profits or losses.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**:
  - Distribution based on the value of contributions if not specified.
  - Presumed application to both profits and losses if specified for one.
- **Exception(s)**: None explicitly stated.

Now, addressing the query: "If parties have not specified the proportions of distributions of the partnership's profits and losses in a partnership contract, profits and losses are distributed to each partner in equal proportions."

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the context, let's identify:
- **Root Node (R1)**: Distribution based on contribution value if not specified.
- **Abstract Factor**: The principle of distribution in partnerships.
- **Base-Level Factor (B1)**: Profits and losses are distributed based on the value of each partner's contribution when not specified.

The query implies a specific scenario where no proportions are specified, directly relating to our identified Base-Level Factor B1. However, it inaccurately states that profits and losses are distributed in equal proportions without specification, which contradicts the rule stated in Article 674(1) that distributions should be based on the value of each partner's contribution.

- **Justification**: The query entails a Base-Level Factor because it discusses distribution in a scenario where proportions are not specified. However, it disagrees with the root (R1) regarding how profits and losses should be distributed when no specific proportions are given.

### Final Output
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of Article 674(1), the query indeed pertains to a base-level factor by discussing distribution without specified proportions. Yet, it misinterprets the method of distribution as equal among partners, which contradicts the rule based on contribution value. Therefore, the justification stands that while the query relates to the base-level factor (B1), it disagrees with the root principle (R1) presented in Article 674(1).

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, we will follow the step-by-step guide.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text is Article 234, which discusses the distance a building must be from a boundary line for its construction and the rights of neighboring landowners in case of violations.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** A building must be constructed at least 50 centimeters away from the boundary line.
- **Rule 2:** If a building is constructed in violation of Rule 1, the owner of the neighboring land may have the construction suspended or changed.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** The building must be less than 50 centimeters away from the boundary line for Rule 2 to apply.
- **Condition 2 (Exception):** If one year passes from the start of construction or if the building is completed, a different condition applies.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence 1:** The owner of the neighboring land can have the construction suspended or changed if Condition 1 is met.
- **Consequence 2 (Under Exception):** If Condition 2 is met, the owner may only claim compensation for loss or damage.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception:** After one year from the start of construction or upon completion of the building, the neighboring landowner's right to suspend or change the construction is limited to claiming compensation for loss or damage.

### Output Format
Given the structured analysis:
- **Rule(s):** 
  - A building must be at least 50 centimeters away from a boundary line.
  - The owner of neighboring land can have construction suspended or changed if this rule is violated.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Construction violates the distance requirement.
  - Time and completion conditions affect the type of action that can be taken.
- **Legal Consequence(s):**
  - Suspension or change of construction for violations before one year passes or completion.
  - Claiming compensation after one year or upon completion.
- **Exception(s):**
  - The right to suspend or change construction is limited after a certain period or upon building completion.

### Justification
Given the query "Even in cases where a building must be constructed 50 centimeters or more distant away from the boundary line, the owner of the neighboring land may not have construction suspended or changed when a person attempts to construct a building in contact with the boundary," we analyze if it entails base-level factors and agrees/disagrees with the root.

- The query directly addresses a situation where **Rule 1** is violated (constructing in contact with the boundary).
- It implies that despite this violation, there's an instance where the neighboring landowner cannot have the construction suspended or changed.
- This scenario aligns with **Condition 2 (Exception)**, suggesting a specific circumstance (time passed or building completed) where actions are limited to claiming compensation.

Thus, the query entails a Base-Level Factor because it considers evidence in a similar situation (violation of the distance rule). Specifically, **(query entails B1)**, where B1 represents the condition under which construction in violation of the distance rule can occur without the neighboring landowner being able to have it suspended or changed.

Regarding agreement with the root:
- The query suggests a limitation on the neighboring landowner's rights that aligns with the exception stated in **Rule 2**.
- Therefore, **(query agree R1)**, as both the query and the root (R1 representing the principle that neighboring landowners have limited actions after certain conditions are met) present scenarios where despite a violation, the landowner's ability to act is restricted.

Upon reevaluation:
- The initial analysis stands correct in terms of identifying base-level factors and agreement with the root. 
- The query directly addresses a nuanced application of the rules provided, focusing on the limitations of action when specific conditions are met (like time elapsed or completion), which aligns with the structured analysis of the article's content.

Therefore, the final answer remains consistent with the initial justification: **(query entails B1)** and **(query agree R1)**.

 To analyze the given legal context and query, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes Article 139, which discusses how periods are calculated when provided in hours. Additionally, a specific scenario is presented where an agreement is made at 10:00 a.m. on June 3 of a given year to fulfill an obligation within five hours.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** When a period is provided for in hours, it commences immediately at the specified time.
- **Rule 2:** The commencement of the period does not include Sundays, holidays as provided in the Act on National Holidays, or any other holiday.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** The period must be specified in hours for Rule 1 to apply.
- **Condition 2:** The commencement time of the period does not fall on a Sunday, holiday as defined by the Act on National Holidays, or any other holiday.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence:** The obligation must be fulfilled within the specified five-hour period starting from the commencement time.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception:** Sundays, holidays as defined by the Act on National Holidays, and other holidays are excluded from being the commencement day of the period.

### Output Format
**Rule(s):**
1. A period provided in hours commences immediately at the specified time.
2. The commencement does not include Sundays or holidays.

**Condition(s):**
1. The period must be specified in hours.
2. The commencement time cannot be on a Sunday, holiday, or other non-working day.

**Legal Consequence(s):**
The obligation must be fulfilled within the specified period from the start time.

**Exception(s):**
Sundays, holidays, and other non-working days are excluded as commencement days for the period.

Given the provided query and the ANGELIC structure formation criteria:
- The **Root Node (R1)** could be "Periods Commence Immediately" with a context of fulfilling obligations within specified times.
- An **Abstract Factor (A1)** might represent "Time Specifications in Agreements."
- A potential **Base-Level Factor (B1)** is "Commencement Time Excludes Non-Working Days."

Justifying whether the query entails base-level factors:
- The query directly discusses an agreement made at a specific time with a condition that excludes Sundays, holidays, or other non-working days as the commencement day for the period. Therefore, **(query entails B1)** because both consider the evidence of excluding non-working days in similar scenarios.

Justifying whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root:
- The root node represents the principle that periods commence immediately at the specified time. The query presents a scenario where an agreement is made for fulfillment within five hours, starting from 10:00 a.m., which aligns with the immediate commencement rule, given it does not fall on a non-working day. Hence, **(query agrees R1)** in comparable situations.

Upon careful reconsideration:
- The analysis holds consistent because the query and the root both support the principle of immediate commencement of periods as specified, with considerations for excluding non-working days. Thus, there is no disagreement between the query's scenario and the rule as stated in Article 139 regarding how periods commence.

- **Rule 1**: The assignment of a claim cannot be duly asserted against the applicable obligor or any other third party unless the assignor gives notice thereof to the obligor or the obligor has consented to the same.
- **Rule 2**: Notice or consent may not be duly asserted against a third party other than the obligor unless it is made using an instrument bearing a certified date.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The assignor must give notice to the obligor, or the obligor must have consented to the assignment for it to be asserted against them.
- **Condition 2**: For the notice or consent to be effective against third parties, it must be made using an instrument with a certified date.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence of fulfilling these conditions is that the assignment can be duly asserted against the obligor and other third parties.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception**: Unless the assignor gives notice to the obligor, or the obligor has acknowledged the assignment using an instrument with a fixed date, the assignment cannot be asserted against third parties.

Given this analysis, let's structure it according to the instructions:

**Rule(s)**: 
1. Assignment of claims requires notice to or consent from the obligor to be asserted.
2. Notice or consent must use an instrument with a certified date for third-party assertion.

**Condition(s)**:
1. Assignor gives notice to the obligor, or the obligor consents.
2. Notice/consent uses an instrument with a certified date for third-party effectiveness.

**Legal Consequence(s)**: 
The assignment can be asserted against the obligor and third parties upon fulfilling conditions.

**Exception(s)**:
Unless there's notice to the obligor or acknowledgment by the obligor with a fixed date, assertion against third parties is not possible.

Now, addressing the query in relation to the ANGELIC structure formation criteria:

The query discusses a scenario where a juridical person assigns a nominative claim for payment of money and whether the assignment can be asserted against a third party without notice or acknowledgment with a fixed date. This scenario directly pertains to **Base-Level Factor B1**, which we can consider as "assertion conditions for assigned claims."

**(query entails B1)**, because both deal with the conditions under which an assigned claim can be asserted against third parties.

Considering the root node (let's denote it as **R1**), which represents the general principle that an assignment requires notice or consent to be asserted, we see that the query and R1 are discussing similar situations. However, the query specifies a scenario where registration of assignment is made but questions the necessity of notice or acknowledgment for assertion against third parties.

Upon careful analysis, it appears that the query essentially **agrees with R1**, because both emphasize the importance of proper notification or acknowledgment (with a fixed date) for asserting assigned claims against obligors or third parties. The query's scenario does not contradict the root principle but rather seeks clarification within its scope.

Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

After rejustification, these conclusions remain accurate based on the information provided and the logical analysis of the legal context and query.

 To address the task, let's break down the legal argument structure from the given context step by step.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text provided is Article 336, which discusses general statutory liens and their assertion against obligees without special security, even if the liens are not registered regarding relevant immovables, with an exception for registered third parties.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule**: General statutory liens can be asserted against obligees without needing a special security or registration concerning the specific immovable properties in question.
  
### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition**: The liens do not need to be registered with respect to the relevant immovables, but there is an exception for registered third parties.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence**: The holder of general statutory liens has the right to have their claim satisfied prior to other obligees who may have registered their liens for sales of immovable properties.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception**: This principle does not apply to registered third parties.

### 6. Output Format

**Rule(s)**: General statutory liens can be asserted against obligees without special security, even if unregistered regarding the immovable properties.
  
**Condition(s)**: The assertion of general statutory liens is generally allowed without registration; however, there's an exception for registered third parties.
  
**Legal Consequence(s)**: The holder of such liens gets priority in claim satisfaction over other obligees without similar registrations.
  
**Exception(s)**: Registered third parties are exempt from this rule.

Now, addressing the query and its relation to the angelic structure formation criteria:

- The query discusses a scenario where a holder of general statutory liens has rights to have their claim satisfied prior to other obligees who have registered their liens for sales of immovable properties.
  
Given this context, let's analyze if the query entails base-level factors and its agreement or disagreement with the root node (R1).

- **Base-Level Factor**: The scenario where a holder of unregistered general statutory liens seeks priority in claim satisfaction over other obligees with registered liens for sales of immovable properties.
  
The query directly pertains to this base-level factor because it discusses the rights and priorities of claim satisfaction in a similar context. Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.

- **Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node (R1)**: The root node, as identified from our analysis, supports the principle that unregistered general statutory liens can be asserted for priority over other obligees without registered liens, except for registered third parties. The query aligns with this principle by asserting a similar right to priority in claim satisfaction. Hence, **(query agree R1)**.

After careful consideration and re-justification of the analysis:

The initial conclusion stands as the query indeed pertains to the base-level factor concerning unregistered general statutory liens seeking priority over registered obligees for immovable property sales. Moreover, it agrees with the root node's principle regarding the assertion and prioritization of such liens.

Thus, reaffirming: **(query entails B1)** and **(query agree R1)**.

 To analyze the given legal context and query, we will follow the step-by-step process outlined.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes several articles related to statutory liens in employer-employee relationships and other scenarios such as sales of movables, leases, and supply of necessities. It outlines conditions under which certain parties have priority over others regarding claims and debts.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
1. **Statutory Lien Priority**: The order of priority for statutory liens follows the order set forth in Article 306 when there are competing general statutory liens.
2. **Special vs. General Liens**: Special statutory liens have priority over general statutory liens, except for expenses for the common benefit which have priority over all obligees benefiting from them.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition for Priority**: The type of claim (e.g., employer-employee relationship, expenses for common benefit, funeral expenses) determines its place in the order of priority.
- **Existence of Competing Liens**: For the rules regarding priority to apply, there must be competing liens.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Priority of Claims**: The legal consequence is the determination of which claimant has priority over the assets or specific movables of the obligor.
- **Payment Order**: This determines the order in which claimants are paid from the obligor's assets.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception for Common Benefit Expenses**: Statutory liens on expenses for the common benefit have priority over all other general statutory liens, regardless of their position in Article 306.
- **Special Liens Over General Liens**: Generally, special statutory liens take precedence over general statutory liens, except as noted for common benefit expenses.

### Step 6: Output Format
**Rule(s)**:
1. Statutory lien priority follows Article 306's order for competing general liens.
2. Special liens have priority over general liens, with an exception for expenses for the common benefit.

**Condition(s)**:
- Type of claim determines its priority.
- Existence of competing liens.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
- Determination of priority among claimants.
- Order of payment from obligor's assets.

**Exception(s)**:
- Expenses for the common benefit have priority over other general statutory liens.
- Special liens generally take precedence over general liens.

Given the query: "In cases where a company has not paid the purchase money with respect to the sale of refrigerators for an electronics store and it has not paid salaries for its employees, the electronics store's statutory lien with respect to the refrigerators shall prevail over employees's statutory lien with respect to the same."

**Analysis**:
- The query involves a scenario where there are competing liens: one from the sale of movables (refrigerators) and another from an employer-employee relationship (salaries).
- According to Article 311, the sale of movables gives rise to a special statutory lien against specific movables of the obligor.
- The query suggests that the electronics store's lien (for the sale of refrigerators) prevails over the employees' lien for salaries.

**ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria Application**:
- **Root Node (R)**: The main legal determination here is about the priority of statutory liens in cases of competing claims.
- **Abstract Factors**: The type of claim (employer-employee vs. sale of movables) and the existence of competing liens are abstract factors influencing the outcome.
- **Base-Level Factors**: Specific scenarios like the sale of refrigerators and non-payment of salaries are base-level factors.

**Justification**:
- The query entails a Base-Level Factor because it considers a specific scenario (sale of refrigerators vs. unpaid employee salaries) similar to those outlined in the legal context, particularly involving special statutory liens.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.
- Comparing the query with the root node regarding priority in competing lien scenarios, we see that the query agrees with the principle that special liens (like that for the sale of refrigerators) generally have priority over general liens (like those for employee salaries), except where expenses for common benefit are involved, which is not the case here.
- Thus, **(query agree R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of statutory lien priorities and the nature of special vs. general liens as outlined in Articles 306 and 311, it's clear that the query aligns with the legal principles stated, reinforcing the conclusion that the electronics store's lien for the sale of refrigerators would indeed have priority over the employees' lien for unpaid salaries in this context.

 To address the given task, let's break down the legal argument structure from the provided context step by step.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text discusses the obligations of a lessor regarding security deposits in the context of a lease agreement. Specifically, it outlines when and how a lessor must return or may use a security deposit received from a lessee.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: A lessor must return the remaining amount of the security deposit to the lessee after deducting any owed obligations in cases where the lease is terminated and the leased thing is returned, or when the lessee lawfully assigns the lease.
- **Rule 2**: If a lessee fails to perform an obligation to pay money based on the lease, the lessor may appropriate the security deposit towards this payment.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The lease is terminated, and the lessor receives the return of the leased thing.
- **Condition 2**: The lessee assigns the lease lawfully.
- **Condition 3**: The lessee fails to perform an obligation to pay money based on the lease.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence 1**: The lessor must return the remaining amount of the security deposit to the lessee after deducting any obligations owed by the lessee.
- **Legal Consequence 2**: The lessor may use the security deposit towards the payment of any obligation not fulfilled by the lessee.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in the text regarding the return or appropriation of the security deposit. However, it's implied that the lessor's right to appropriate the deposit is contingent on the lessee's failure to fulfill a lease-based monetary obligation.

### 6. Output Format
Given the instructions, here is the structured format:

**Rule(s)**:
1. A lessor must return the remaining security deposit after deducting owed obligations in specific scenarios.
2. A lessor may appropriate the security deposit towards unpaid lease obligations if the lessee fails to pay.

**Condition(s)**:
1. Lease termination with the return of the leased thing.
2. Lawful assignment of the lease by the lessee.
3. Lessee's failure to perform a monetary obligation based on the lease.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
1. The lessor returns the remaining security deposit to the lessee after deductions for owed obligations.
2. The lessor may use the security deposit for unpaid lease obligations if the lessee defaults.

**Exception(s)**:
None explicitly stated, but implied limitations exist based on the conditions (e.g., the lessor's right to appropriate the deposit is contingent on the lessee's default).

---

Regarding the query: "The obligation to return a security deposit and the obligation to return a leased thing in the case of the termination of a lease are to be performed simultaneously."

**ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria Analysis**:

- **Existence of a Root Node (R)**: The primary legal determination here involves the obligations of lessors regarding security deposits upon lease termination or assignment.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships**: The context is about the timing and conditions under which a lessor must return a security deposit or may appropriate it. The relationships are defined by the conditions (lease termination, lawful assignment, lessee default) that trigger specific legal consequences.

**Node Naming Convention**:
Let's label the Root Node as **R1**, focusing on the obligation to return security deposits upon lease termination with the return of the leased thing.

Given the query and the base-level factor analysis:

- The query considers a scenario where two obligations (returning the security deposit and returning the leased thing) are performed simultaneously upon lease termination. This directly relates to **Condition 1** and **Legal Consequence 1**, which can be considered as entailing a Base-Level Factor (**B1**) because both the query and B1 consider the evidence in similar situations (lease termination and the return of the leased thing).
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.
  
- The query seems to agree with the principle outlined in **R1** that upon lease termination (and presumably the return of the leased thing), there is an obligation to return the security deposit. However, the query specifies simultaneity, which isn't explicitly mentioned in R1 but can be inferred as part of the process of terminating a lease and settling obligations.
- Thus, **(query agree R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of the legal text provided and the nature of the query:
- The agreement between the query and R1 holds because both are concerned with the obligations following lease termination. However, the simultaneity aspect in the query could be seen as an interpretation or a specific application of the general principle stated in R1.
- Therefore, the initial assessment that **(query agree R1)** stands, as both deal with the context of lease termination and the lessor's obligations regarding security deposits, albeit the query introduces a temporal aspect (simultaneity) not explicitly covered in R1. 

Hence, the final assessments are:
**(query entails B1)** and **(query agree R1)**.

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the instructions, let's break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The provided text includes Article 587 and Article 588, which define a loan for consumption and its effectiveness. Additionally, there's a query regarding a quasi-loan having no effect if the borrower does not deliver the subject matter to the lender.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
Based on the articles:
- A loan for consumption is effective when one party receives something from another with the promise to return something of the same type, quality, and quantity.
- An arrangement can be deemed a loan for consumption if parties agree it is so, even if it initially seems different.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions are:
- Receipt of money or goods by one party from another.
- A promise to return something of the same type, quality, and quantity.
- Parties must agree that an arrangement constitutes a loan for consumption for it to be considered as such.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is:
- The establishment of a loan for consumption relationship between the parties, with the borrower obligated to return the borrowed item or its equivalent.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
No explicit exceptions are mentioned in the provided articles regarding the general principles of loans for consumption. However, the query introduces a scenario that could be considered an exception or special case: if the borrower does not deliver the subject matter of a quasi-loan to the lender, it has no effect.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** A loan for consumption is established when one party receives goods or money with the promise to return equivalent goods or money. Parties can agree to consider an arrangement as a loan for consumption.
- **Condition(s):** Receipt of goods or money, promise of return, and mutual agreement on the nature of the arrangement.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** Establishment of a loan for consumption with obligations for the borrower.
- **Exception(s):** The query suggests a scenario where failure to deliver (in the context of a quasi-loan) might negate the loan's effect, but this is not explicitly covered by the provided articles.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Let's apply these criteria:
- **Root Node (R):** R1 could be "A loan for consumption is established when one party receives goods or money with a promise to return equivalent goods or money."
- **Abstract Factors:** A1 could represent the concept of "agreement between parties" and A2 could represent "the nature of the exchanged goods or money."
- **Base-Level Factors:** B1 could be "receipt of goods or money," B2 could be "promise of return," and B3 could be "mutual agreement on the arrangement's nature."

### Justification
The query mentions a quasi-loan having no effect if the borrower does not deliver the subject matter. This scenario directly relates to the conditions under which a loan for consumption (or quasi-loan) is considered effective, specifically touching upon the concept of delivery or receipt of goods as a crucial aspect (B1: "receipt of goods or money"). Thus, **(query entails B1)**.

Regarding agreement with the root node (R1), if we consider R1 to represent the establishment of a loan for consumption based on certain conditions, the query actually touches upon a condition (delivery) that could negate the effectiveness of such a loan. Therefore, it does not directly support or agree with R1's general statement about how a loan for consumption is established but rather introduces a specific scenario that could be seen as an exception or additional condition. Hence, **(query disagree R1)** in the context of this specific scenario regarding quasi-loans and delivery.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of legal language and the specifics of the query, it's clear that the disagreement is more about introducing a special case rather than directly opposing the root principle. However, based on the provided instructions and the nature of the analysis, the conclusion remains focused on the entailment and agreement aspects as initially justified.

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the instructions provided, let's break down the task step by step.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text discusses Article 542(1) regarding cancellation without demand in contractual obligations, outlining scenarios where an obligee can immediately cancel a contract or part of it without making a prior demand.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** The obligee may immediately cancel the contract without making a demand if certain conditions are met, such as impossibility of performance, refusal to perform by the obligor, or failure to perform within a specified time frame crucial for achieving the contract's purpose.
- **Rule 2:** The obligee can also cancel part of the contract under specific conditions, like impossibility of performing that part or clear intention by the obligor to refuse that part.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** Impossibility of whole or part performance.
- **Condition 2:** The obligor's unequivocal manifestation to refuse whole or part performance.
- **Condition 3:** Failure to perform within a critical time frame for achieving the contract's purpose.
- **Condition 4 (Implicit):** The failure of the obligee making a demand under specific circumstances.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that the obligee may immediately cancel the contract or part thereof without needing to make a prior demand if any of the conditions are met.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception:** The existence of other contractual terms or understandings between parties could potentially modify these rules, but such exceptions are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

### Output Format
**Rule(s):**
1. Immediate cancellation without demand is possible under certain conditions.
2. Partial cancellation can occur if specific part-related conditions are met.

**Condition(s):**
1. Impossibility of performance (whole or part).
2. Obligor's refusal to perform (whole or part).
3. Failure within a critical time frame.
4. Implicit: Specific scenarios where demand is deemed unnecessary.

**Legal Consequence(s):**
Immediate cancellation of the contract or part thereof without prior demand.

**Exception(s):**
None explicitly stated in the provided text, but potential modifications through other contractual agreements or understandings could apply.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the complexity and specificity required for a detailed ANGELIC structure analysis within this response format, we focus on the core question of whether the query entails base-level factors and its agreement with the root node's verdict.

- **Root Node (R1):** The obligee can cancel the contract without demand under specified conditions.
- **Abstract Factor:** Conditions for cancellation (impossibility, refusal, time sensitivity).
- **Base-Level Factors (B1):** Failure to perform due to impossibility or clear refusal by the obligor.

### Query Analysis
The query discusses a scenario where the obligor fails to perform and it's clear they won't achieve the contract's purpose even after notice. This aligns with conditions outlined in Article 542(1), specifically condition (v) which mentions failure to perform with an obvious inability to fulfill the obligation sufficiently.

- **Query Entails B1:** The query does indeed consider a scenario similar to Base-Level Factor B1, focusing on performance failure and its implications.
- **Query Agree R1:** Given that both the query and Root Node R1 concern scenarios where cancellation without demand is justified due to the obligor's actions or circumstances leading to an inability to fulfill contractual obligations, they agree on the verdict in comparable situations.

Upon reevaluation, considering the nuances of legal language and the specific conditions outlined in Article 542(1), it remains clear that the query and Root Node R1 are aligned in their consideration of when cancellation without demand is permissible. The critical aspect is the recognition of scenarios where performance is impossible or where the obligor's actions (or lack thereof) demonstrate a clear inability to meet contractual obligations, thereby justifying immediate cancellation.

Thus, the conclusions stand as:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text provided is about loans for consumption becoming effective under certain conditions.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule:** A loan for consumption becomes effective when one party receives something from another with the promise to return something of the same type, quality, and quantity.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition:** The loan becomes effective when a first party receives money or any other thing from a second party, having promised to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence:** The loan for consumption becomes effective under the specified conditions.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- There are no explicit exceptions or limitations mentioned in the provided text.

### 6. Output Format
Given the analysis:
- **Rule(s):** A loan for consumption is effective based on receipt and promise of return.
- **Condition(s):** Receipt of money or things with a promise to return similar items.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The loan becomes effective.
- **Exception(s):** None mentioned.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the context, we can identify:
- **Root Node (R1):** A loan for consumption is effective based on the conditions provided.
- **Abstract Factors:** None explicitly mentioned but could include concepts of contractual agreements and property exchange.
- **Base-Level Factors (B1):** The effectiveness of a loan for consumption when one party receives something with the promise to return something similar.

### Query Analysis
The query mentions that "A loan for consumption not made in writing becomes effective when a first party receives money or any other thing from a second party, having promised to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity." This introduces the idea of a loan not made in writing, which is not explicitly addressed in the original rule.

### Justification
- The query does **entail Base-Level Factor B1** because it discusses the effectiveness of a loan for consumption based on similar conditions (receipt and promise of return).
- However, the query **disagrees with Root R1** as presented because it specifies a condition (not made in writing) that is not mentioned in the original rule. The original rule does not address whether the loan must be in writing to become effective.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, considering the provided context and instructions:
- The query indeed **entails B1** since both are concerned with the conditions under which a loan for consumption becomes effective.
- The disagreement lies in the specification of "not made in writing," which introduces a condition not originally stated. Thus, the query could be seen as either agreeing or disagreeing depending on interpretation, but given the original rule does not specify the need for written form, and assuming the query implies an oral agreement can also make a loan effective (which aligns with the general principle of contract law that contracts can be verbal), it might **agree with R1** in terms of the core condition for effectiveness (receipt and promise) but introduces a nuance (written vs. not written) not addressed by R1.

Therefore, given the nuanced understanding:
- **(query entails B1)**
- Upon closer inspection and considering typical legal reasoning around contracts, **(query agree R1)** in terms of the core principle of effectiveness based on receipt and promise but with an added consideration regarding the form of the agreement.

 To analyze the given legal context and query, we will follow the step-by-step instructions provided.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text discusses the concept of self-contracting and representation of both parties in a juridical act, specifically addressing situations where an agent acts on behalf of one or both parties involved in a contract.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: An act performed by a person as an agent of the counterparty or as an agent of both parties for the same juridical act is deemed to be an act performed by a person without authority to represent, unless it's for the performance of an obligation or authorized by the principal in advance.
- **Rule 2**: An act where the interest of the agent conflicts with that of the principal is also deemed to be an act performed by a person without authority to represent, unless authorized by the principal in advance.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The act is performed as an agent of the counterparty or both parties.
- **Condition 2**: The act involves a conflict of interest between the agent and the principal.
- Exceptions to these conditions include acts for performing obligations or those authorized by the principal in advance.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that such an act is deemed to be performed by a person without authority to represent, implying potential invalidity or challenge to the act's legality.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1**: Acts for performing obligations.
- **Exception 2**: Acts authorized by the principal in advance.

### Step 6: Output Format
**Rule(s)**:
1. An agent acting for both parties or the counterparty without specific authorization is deemed to act without authority.
2. Acts with a conflict of interest are also considered unauthorized unless pre-approved.

**Condition(s)**:
1. Acting as an agent for the counterparty or both parties.
2. Presence of a conflict of interest.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
Acts under these conditions are deemed unauthorized.

**Exception(s)**:
1. Performance of obligations.
2. Pre-authorization by the principal.

Given the query: "If A performs B's obligation to A based on a contract between A and B as B's agent, such performance is deemed to be an act performed by a person without authority to represent."

### Analysis
The query involves A acting as B's agent in performing B's obligation to A. According to Rule 1 and its exception, if this act is for the performance of an obligation (which it is), then despite A being B's agent, the act could still be considered valid under the exception provided.

Considering the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:
- **Root Node (R)**: The primary legal determination here revolves around the validity of acts performed by agents in potential conflicts of interest or self-contracting scenarios.
- **Abstract Factors**: Concepts like "authority to represent," "conflict of interest," and "pre-authorization" play crucial roles.
- **Base-Level Factors**: Specific scenarios like A performing B's obligation as B's agent.

### Justification
The query **entails a Base-Level Factor (B1)** because it presents a specific scenario involving an agent (A) acting on behalf of the principal (B) in a situation that could be seen as self-contracting or potentially conflicting. However, given the exception for acts performing obligations, this specific scenario might not directly fall under the general rule against unauthorized representation.

Regarding agreement with the Root Node:
- The query seems to **disagree with R1** if we consider R1 to represent the general principle that such acts are deemed unauthorized. This is because the query's scenario involves an act (performing B's obligation) that, based on the exception, might not be deemed unauthorized.

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances of legal interpretation and the specific wording of the rules and exceptions provided:
- The initial analysis stands with a refinement: the query indeed presents a **Base-Level Factor** relevant to the discussion.
- However, upon closer examination, it appears there was an oversight in directly applying the exception without fully considering the context of "performing obligations" as a valid act despite potential conflicts. Thus, while the query does involve a scenario that could be considered under the rules provided, its alignment with or deviation from the root determination (R1) hinges on interpreting the exceptions correctly.

Therefore, given the format requirements and upon careful consideration:
- **(query entails B1)**: The query does indeed present a scenario that aligns with considering base-level factors relevant to the legal context.
- Upon further reflection, there might have been an initial inclination to suggest disagreement based on a strict reading of the rules without fully accounting for the exceptions. However, the correct approach involves recognizing the query's scenario as one that could potentially fall under an exception rather than directly opposing the root determination.

Thus, after careful analysis and rejustification:
- **(query entails B1)** is confirmed due to its relevance to the base-level factors in question.
- The interpretation regarding agreement or disagreement with R1 should be refined based on understanding that the query's scenario could indeed benefit from the exception for performing obligations, which suggests a more nuanced relationship between the query and the root determination than initially outlined.

 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process step by step.

### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes Article 106, which discusses the role and authority of a subagent, and a query about a guardian of an adult appointing a sub-agent.

### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: A subagent has the authority to represent the principal in acts within the scope of their authority.
- **Rule 2**: A subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent regarding the principal and third parties within their authority.

### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- The conditions for a subagent's authority and responsibilities are that the actions must be within the scope of their authority.

### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- The legal consequence is that the subagent can bind the principal in dealings with third parties and has obligations towards both the principal and third parties.

### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- There are no explicit exceptions mentioned in Article 106 regarding the appointment of a subagent by a guardian of an adult. However, the query introduces a condition where a guardian of an adult may not appoint a sub-agent unless there is an unavoidable reason to do so.

### Step 6: Output Format
Given the instructions:
- **Rule(s)**: 
  - A subagent represents the principal within their authority scope.
  - A subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent within their authority.
- **Condition(s)**: Actions must be within the scope of the subagent's authority.
- **Legal Consequence(s)**: The subagent can represent the principal and has the same rights and obligations as an agent.
- **Exception(s)**: None explicitly stated in Article 106, but the query introduces a condition for a guardian of an adult appointing a sub-agent.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the context, let's define the nodes:
- **R1 (Root Node)**: A subagent can represent the principal within their authority.
- **A1 (Abstract Factor)**: Authority Scope
- **B1 (Base-Level Factor)**: Appointment of a sub-agent by a guardian of an adult without an unavoidable reason.

### Justification
The query directly addresses the situation of a guardian of an adult appointing a sub-agent, which can be considered under the base-level factor **B1**. Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.

Comparing the query with the root node **R1**, the query introduces a specific condition (unavoidable reason) for the appointment of a sub-agent by a guardian of an adult, which is not explicitly mentioned in Article 106 but pertains to the scope of authority and representation. However, since **R1** generally allows for representation within authority and does not specify conditions for guardians of adults, and the query introduces a restrictive condition not present in **R1**, we can say that **(query disagree R1)** because it adds a limitation not originally stated in Article 106 regarding the appointment of sub-agents by guardians of adults.

Upon re-justification, considering the specifics of the query and the general principles outlined in Article 106, the conclusion remains consistent. The query does indeed pertain to the base-level factor **B1** and introduces a condition that is not aligned with the general rule stated in **R1**, thus disagreeing with it by adding an additional requirement for guardians of adults appointing sub-agents.

Therefore, the final justification is:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagree R1)**
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 query_entails(B1).query_disagree(R1).
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To analyze the given legal context and query according to the provided instructions, let's break down the process into steps:

### 1. Read the Provided Text:
The text provided is Article 470, subsection 3, which discusses the assumption of obligation not releasing an obligor through a contract between the initial obligor and the person becoming the additional obligor. This becomes effective upon the obligee's consent to the person assuming the additional obligation.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle):
The general principle here is that an assumption of obligation not releasing an obligor can be effected through a contract, requiring the obligee's consent for it to become effective.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability):
The condition for this rule to apply is that there must be a contract between the initial obligor and the person becoming the additional obligor, and the obligee must give consent to this arrangement.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome):
The legal consequence of meeting these conditions is that the assumption of obligation becomes effective, meaning the additional obligor takes on the obligation without releasing the initial obligor from their responsibility.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases):
There are no explicit exceptions or limitations mentioned in the provided text regarding this specific scenario.

### Output Format:
- **Rule(s):** The assumption of obligation not releasing an obligor can be effected through a contract between the initial obligor and the additional obligor, requiring the obligee's consent.
- **Condition(s):** 
  1. A contract must exist between the initial obligor and the person becoming the additional obligor.
  2. The obligee must give consent to this arrangement.
- **Legal Consequence(s):** The assumption of obligation becomes effective, with the additional obligor taking on the obligation without releasing the initial obligor.
- **Exception(s):** None mentioned.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria:
Given the query and the analysis above, let's consider if it entails base-level factors or agrees/disagrees with a root node:

- The query "The assumption of obligation not releasing an obligor by a contract between the initial obligor and the person that becomes the additional obligor becomes effective when the obligee gives consent to the person that becomes the additional obligor" directly reflects the conditions and consequences outlined in Article 470(3).
- **Justification:** The query entails a base-level factor because it considers the evidence in a similar situation or scenario as described by the rule. Specifically, this aligns with the condition requiring the obligee's consent for the assumption of obligation to become effective.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and justification:

- **(query entails B1):** Yes, because the query directly relates to the conditions under which the assumption of obligation not releasing an obligor becomes effective.
- **(query agree R1):** Yes, because the query statement aligns with the rule's legal consequence regarding when the assumption of obligation becomes effective.

After careful consideration and re-justification, the conclusion remains that the query both entails a base-level factor (considering similar evidence or scenarios) and agrees with the root node (presenting the same verdict in comparable situations).

 Let's break down the given legal context and query step by step according to the instructions:

1. **Read the Provided Text**: The text is about Article 651, which discusses the cancellation of a mandate by either party at any time and the conditions under which compensation for damage suffered by the other party must be provided.

2. **Identify the Rule (General Principle)**: 
   - A mandate can be cancelled by either party at any time.
   - A party that cancels a mandate must compensate for damage suffered by the other party under certain conditions.

3. **Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)**:
   - The cancellation occurs at a time detrimental to the other party.
   - The mandator cancels the mandate for which the purpose includes interests for the mandatary (excluding profit from remuneration).
   - There was no compelling reason for the cancellation.

4. **Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)**:
   - The party that cancelled the mandate must compensate for damage suffered by the other party if the conditions are met.

5. **Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)**:
   - If there was a compelling reason for the cancellation, the party that cancelled the mandate does not have to compensate for damage.

**Output Format**:

- **Rule(s)**: 
  - A mandate can be cancelled by either party at any time.
  - Compensation for damage is required under specific conditions after cancellation.

- **Condition(s)**:
  - Cancellation at a detrimental time.
  - Cancellation involving the mandatary's interests (excluding remuneration profit).
  - Lack of a compelling reason for cancellation.

- **Legal Consequence(s)**: 
  - The cancelling party must compensate for damage under specified conditions.

- **Exception(s)**:
  - Existence of a compelling reason for cancellation.

Given the query: "A party that has cancelled a mandate, notwithstanding the time of the cancellation, is not liable to the other party for compensation for loss or damage."

**ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria**:

Let's identify the nodes and their relationships based on the provided text and query:

- **Root Node (R1)**: A party that cancels a mandate may be liable for compensation under certain conditions.
- **Abstract Factors**: 
  - A1: Timing of cancellation
  - A2: Purpose of the mandate involving interests for the mandatary
- **Base-Level Factors**:
  - B1: Cancellation at a time detrimental to the other party
  - B2: Lack of compelling reason for cancellation

The query directly relates to the conditions under which compensation is required or not, specifically addressing liability "notwithstanding the time of the cancellation." This implies that the query considers scenarios where the timing of cancellation (B1) might normally affect liability but argues against liability regardless.

**(query entails B1)** because it discusses a scenario where the timing of cancellation does not influence the liability for compensation.

Comparing the query with **Root Node R1**, we see that while R1 suggests liability under certain conditions, the query posits no liability "notwithstanding the time of the cancellation." This indicates a disagreement between the query and the root regarding the verdict in comparable situations.

**(query disagree R1)** because the query argues against liability for compensation regardless of the cancellation time, contrary to R1 which implies potential liability under specific conditions related to the timing and purpose of the cancellation.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of legal language and the context provided:

The query's stance on no liability "notwithstanding the time of the cancellation" directly challenges the conditional liability outlined in Article 651, particularly the condition regarding the detrimental timing of cancellation. Thus, the disagreement between the query and R1 holds, as they present differing views on when a party is liable for compensation after cancelling a mandate.

Therefore, the final assessment remains that **(query entails B1)** and **(query disagree R1)**.

32 correct 32 wrongs 64 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions provided to analyze the given legal context and then evaluate the query against this analysis.


### Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The text includes two articles from a civil legal code:
- Article 643: A mandate becomes effective when a first party asks a second party to perform a juridical act, and the second party accepts.
- Article 656: The provisions of this Section apply mutatis mutandis (with necessary changes) to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts.


### Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
Two rules can be identified:
1. A mandate is effective upon acceptance by the second party for performing a juridical act.
2. The provisions regarding mandates also apply, with adjustments, to non-juridical business entrustments.


### Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
Conditions include:
- The first party must ask the second party to perform a specific action (juridical act).
- The second party must accept this request.
- For Article 656, the business entrustment does not constitute a juridical act.


### Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence is that the mandate becomes effective upon acceptance by the second party. Additionally, similar provisions apply to certain non-juridical business entrustments.


### Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
No explicit exceptions are stated in the provided articles, but Article 656 implies an adjustment for non-juridical acts, which can be seen as a special case rather than an exception to the effectiveness of mandates.


### Output Format
Given the instructions and analysis:
- **Rule(s):** 
  1. A mandate is effective upon acceptance by the second party for performing a juridical act.
  2. Provisions regarding mandates apply with adjustments to non-juridical business entrustments.
- **Condition(s):**
  - Request by the first party for a juridical act.
  - Acceptance by the second party.
  - Business entrustment does not constitute a juridical act (for Article 656).
- **Legal Consequence(s):** 
  - The mandate becomes effective upon acceptance.
  - Similar provisions apply to certain non-juridical business entrustments.
- **Exception(s):**
  None explicitly stated, but adjustments for non-juridical acts are considered.


### Justification
The query states: "A quasi-mandate shall be effective even if it is not made in writing but a mandate shall not be effective unless it is made in writing." This introduces the concept of written form as a condition for effectiveness, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided articles. However, the query can be seen to relate to the base-level factors (conditions and consequences) implied by the rules regarding mandates.


### Entailment and Agreement
- The query **entails B1** because it discusses conditions under which a mandate or quasi-mandate is effective, aligning with the analysis of conditions for mandate effectiveness.
- The query does not directly agree or disagree with **R1** (the root node representing the general principle that a mandate becomes effective upon acceptance) since R1 does not specify anything about written form. However, if we interpret the query's introduction of a written requirement as an additional condition for mandate effectiveness, it could be seen to introduce a distinction not covered by R1.


### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, considering the angelic structure formation criteria and the specific instructions:
- The query introduces the concept of written form, which is not present in the original rules. This suggests that while the query **entails B1** due to its discussion of mandate effectiveness conditions, it does so by introducing a new condition (written form) not explicitly covered by the provided articles.
- Given this, the query can be seen as providing additional specificity or conditions rather than directly agreeing or disagreeing with the root node **R1**, which focuses on acceptance as the criterion for mandate effectiveness.


Therefore, the conclusion based on the given analysis and justification is:
- (query entails B1)
There isn't a direct agreement or disagreement with R1 due to the introduction of new conditions (written form) not addressed in the original rules.

 To address the given task, we'll follow the step-by-step instructions provided.


## Step 1: Read the Provided Text
The given legal statement or article is Article 587, which states that a loan for consumption becomes effective when a first party receives money or any other thing from a second party, having promised to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity.


## Step 2: Identify the Rule (General Principle)
The general principle stated in the text can be summarized as:
- A loan for consumption is considered effective upon the receipt of goods or money by one party from another, with the understanding that items of the same kind, quality, and amount will be returned.

## Step 3: Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
The conditions under which this rule applies include:
- The receipt of money or other goods by one party from another.
- A promise to return items of the same type, quality, and quantity.

## Step 4: Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
The legal consequence of meeting these conditions is that the loan for consumption becomes effective.

## Step 5: Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
There are no explicit exceptions or limitations mentioned in the provided text.


## Step 6: Output Format
Rule(s):
- A loan for consumption is considered effective upon the receipt of goods or money by one party from another, with the understanding that items of the same kind, quality, and amount will be returned.

Condition(s):
- Receipt of money or other goods.
- Promise to return items of the same type, quality, and quantity.

Legal Consequence(s):
- The loan for consumption becomes effective.

Exception(s):
- None explicitly stated.


Given the query "Properties other than money may be made the subject of a loan for consumption," we analyze its relation to the extracted structure:


The query directly relates to the rule that specifies what can be the subject of a loan for consumption, which includes "money or any other thing." Thus, it considers the evidence in a similar situation or scenario as base-level factor B1 (if we were to label the condition or aspect of the rule regarding the type of items that can be loaned as B1), because both are about what can be loaned.


Therefore, (query entails B1).


Considering the root node R1, which represents the general principle that a loan for consumption is effective when one party receives something from another with a promise to return similar items, the query agrees with this root. The query specifies that properties other than money can be part of such an agreement, which aligns with the rule's inclusion of "any other thing" besides money.


Thus, (query agree R1).


After rejustification, the conclusion remains that the query both entails a base-level factor and agrees with the root node of the legal argument structure. 


The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B1), (query agree R1)}$
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 query_entails(B1).query_agree(R1).
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the legal argument structure from the provided context step by step.

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The text includes two articles: Article 321 and Article 304. Article 321 discusses statutory liens for the sale of movables, stating that such liens exist against movables in connection with their price and interest. Article 304 explains that a statutory lien can also be exercised against things (including monies) that the obligor is to receive due to the sale, lease, loss, or damage of the subject matter of the statutory lien, provided that the holder attaches these before payment or delivery.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1**: Statutory liens for the sale of movables exist against those movables regarding their price and interest.
- **Rule 2**: A statutory lien can be exercised against monies or things the obligor is to receive from the sale, lease, loss, or damage of the subject matter, given that the holder attaches these before payment.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1**: The existence of a statutory lien for the sale of movables.
- **Condition 2**: The obligor must be receiving monies or other things due to the sale, lease, loss, or damage of the subject matter of the statutory lien.
- **Condition 3**: The holder of the statutory lien must attach the monies or other things before their payment or delivery.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Legal Consequence**: If conditions are met, the holder of the statutory lien may exercise their right against the purchase money claim accrued from the sales.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1**: The holder must attach the monies or other things before payment or delivery; otherwise, they cannot exercise their right.
- **Exception 2**: This applies to consideration for real rights created by the obligor on the subject matter of the statutory lien.

### 6. Output Format
**Rule(s)**: 
1. Statutory liens exist for the sale of movables regarding price and interest.
2. A statutory lien can be exercised against monies from the sale, lease, loss, or damage of the subject matter if attached before payment.

**Condition(s)**:
1. Existence of a statutory lien for movable sales.
2. Obligor receives monies due to the sale, lease, loss, or damage of the subject matter.
3. Holder attaches monies before payment.

**Legal Consequence(s)**: 
The holder may exercise their right against the purchase money claim if conditions are met.

**Exception(s)**:
1. Attachment must occur before payment or delivery.
2. Applies to real rights consideration on the subject matter.

Given the query, "If the obligor sold the subject matter of a statutory lien to a third party, the holder of the statutory lien for sales of movables may exercise such right against the purchase money claim accrued from the sales," and analyzing it with the provided context:

- The query **entails base-level factor B1** because it considers a scenario where the obligor sells the subject matter (a specific situation) and discusses exercising the statutory lien right against the purchase money claim, which aligns with the conditions and consequences outlined in Article 304.
  
- The query **agrees with root R1** because both the query and the rule stated in Article 304 present a scenario where the holder of the statutory lien can exercise their rights against the monies received from the sale of the subject matter, under the condition that these are attached before payment or delivery.

Therefore, based on the analysis:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

 To address the task step by step:

### 1. Read the Provided Text
The provided text is Article 13, which outlines the requirements and procedures for a person under curatorship to perform certain acts, including the need for consent from their curator.

### 2. Identify the Rule (General Principle)
- **Rule 1:** A person under curatorship must obtain the consent of their curator to perform specific acts listed in Article 13(1).
- **Rule 2:** The family court may decide that a person under curatorship needs to obtain the curator's consent for acts not listed, at the request of certain individuals.
- **Rule 3:** If the curator does not consent to an act unlikely to prejudice the person under curatorship, the family court may grant permission in lieu of the curator's consent.

### 3. Determine the Conditions (Scope & Applicability)
- **Condition 1:** The act is one of those specified in Article 13(1) or as decided by the family court under Article 13(2).
- **Condition 2:** The curator does not give consent for an act.
- **Condition 3:** The act is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship.

### 4. Specify the Legal Consequence (Outcome)
- **Consequence 1:** Without the curator's consent or court permission, the act performed by the person under curatorship is voidable.
- **Consequence 2:** The family court may grant permission for an act in lieu of the curator's consent.

### 5. Identify Exceptions or Limitations (Rebuttal or Special Cases)
- **Exception 1:** Acts provided for in the proviso to Article 9 are exempt from requiring the curator's consent.
- **Exception 2:** The family court's decision can override the need for the curator's consent under specific circumstances.

### 6. Output Format

**Rule(s):**
1. A person under curatorship must obtain their curator's consent for specified acts.
2. The family court may decide on additional acts requiring consent.
3. The court can grant permission in lieu of consent if an act won't prejudice the person under curatorship.

**Condition(s):**
1. Specific acts as listed or decided by the court.
2. Lack of curator's consent.
3. Act is unlikely to cause prejudice.

**Legal Consequence(s):**
1. Acts without consent are voidable.
2. Court may grant permission in lieu of consent.

**Exception(s):**
1. Exemption for acts under Article 9's proviso.
2. Court's decision can override the need for curator's consent.

Given the query: "With respect to any act which requires the consent of the curator, if the curator does not give consent in cases where the interest of the person under curatorship is unlikely to be prejudiced, the person under curatorship may make a claim to the family court for a permission in lieu of the consent of the curator."

- **Justification:** The query directly addresses a scenario covered by Rule 3 and Condition 3, focusing on the legal consequence where the curator's consent is not given but the act is unlikely to prejudice the person under curatorship. This aligns with Consequence 2.
  
- **Conclusion:** (query entails B1), as it considers a base-level factor regarding the process for obtaining permission in lieu of the curator's consent when the act is unlikely to cause prejudice, directly aligning with the evidence and scenario presented in Article 13(3).

- **Agreement with Root:** (query agree R1), because both the query and Rule 3 (R1) agree that in situations where the curator does not give consent for an act unlikely to prejudice the person under curatorship, the family court may grant permission in lieu of the curator's consent.

Upon re-justification, the conclusion remains consistent: the query aligns with a base-level factor concerning the process for handling acts without curator consent when no prejudice is expected, and it agrees with the root (R1) regarding the legal course of action in such scenarios.
