 After carefully reading Article 495, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The deposit under the provisions of the preceding Article must be made with the official depository having jurisdiction over the place where the relevant obligation is performed.
2. There is no specific provision in laws and regulations with respect to the official depository.
3. The court, at the request of the performer, must designate the depository and appoint a custodian of the thing to be deposited.
4. A person has effected a deposit pursuant to the provisions of the preceding Article.
5. The person that has effected a deposit must notify the obligee of the deposit without delay.

Verdict: A person that has effected a deposit pursuant to the provisions of the preceding Article must notify the obligee of the deposit without delay, and the court may designate the depository and appoint a custodian if there is no specific provision in laws and regulations.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 I will generate 4 law cases based on the given factors.

**Case 1:** 
The defendant made a deposit with the official depository having jurisdiction over the place where the relevant obligation was performed and notified the obligee of the deposit without delay. 
Justification: Since factor 1 (the deposit was made with the correct depository) and factor 5 (the defendant notified the obligee without delay) are met, the defendant has fulfilled their obligations.
Output: (1, 5 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
There is no specific provision in laws and regulations regarding the official depository, but the court did not designate a depository or appoint a custodian at the request of the performer. The defendant did not make a deposit.
Justification: Since factor 2 (no specific provision) is met, but factor 3 (court designation) was not followed, and factor 4 (deposit was not made) is not applicable, the defendant cannot be considered to have fulfilled their obligations.
Output: (2 | N)

**Case 3:** 
The defendant effected a deposit pursuant to the provisions of the preceding Article but failed to notify the obligee without delay. The deposit was made with the correct depository.
Justification: Although factor 1 (correct depository) and factor 4 (deposit was made) are met, factor 5 (notification without delay) was not fulfilled. Therefore, the defendant's obligations are not fully met.
Output: (1, 4 | N)

**Case 4:** 
The court designated a depository and appointed a custodian at the request of the performer because there was no specific provision in laws and regulations. The defendant then made a deposit with this designated depository but did not notify the obligee.
Justification: Since factor 2 (no specific provision) and factor 3 (court designation) are met, and factor 4 (deposit was made) is also fulfilled, the only issue is the lack of notification (factor 5). However, given that the other conditions were correctly followed, the defendant's failure to notify does not entirely negate their pledge.
Output: (2, 3, 4 | Y)

Note: These cases are hypothetical and created for illustration purposes based on the provided factors. Actual legal verdicts would depend on a thorough analysis of all relevant laws and specific circumstances of each case.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that to use money or documents of title for performance deposit, they shall be put in the official depository of the place of performance of the obligation. This statement aligns with Factor 1, which specifies that the deposit must be made with the official depository having jurisdiction over the place where the relevant obligation is performed.

Based on logical reasoning and considering the information provided by the factors, especially Factor 1, the query seems to accurately reflect a requirement for making a performance deposit. Therefore, the query can be considered **True** in the context of the given factors.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

Let's evaluate each factor against the query:

1. **The deposit under the provisions of the preceding Article must be made with the official depository having jurisdiction over the place where the relevant obligation is performed.**
   ➡ (query entails Factor 1) because it specifies using the official depository of the place of performance for the deposit.

2. **There is no specific provision in laws and regulations with respect to the official depository.**
   The query does not directly address this factor, as it assumes the existence of an official depository without mentioning any lack of provisions regarding it.
   ➡ (query does not entail Factor 2)

3. **The court, at the request of the performer, must designate the depository and appoint a custodian of the thing to be deposited.**
   The query focuses on where to put money or documents for performance deposit but doesn't discuss court designation or custodian appointment.
   ➡ (query does not entail Factor 3)

4. **A person has effected a deposit pursuant to the provisions of the preceding Article.**
   While the query talks about using an official depository for deposits, it doesn't explicitly state that someone has already made such a deposit.
   ➡ (query does not directly entail Factor 4, but implies a scenario where a deposit is being considered)

5. **The person that has effected a deposit must notify the obligee of the deposit without delay.**
   The query is silent on the notification process after a deposit has been made.
   ➡ (query does not entail Factor 5)

Justifications provided align with the logical reasoning in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is **True** within the context of requiring deposits to be made at an official depository relevant to the obligation's performance.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict involves a person who has effected a deposit and must notify the obligee, with provisions for court designation of a depository if necessary. The query discusses how to properly make a performance deposit (by using an official depository), which can be seen as guidance for someone about to make such a deposit or ensure their actions are in line with legal requirements.

Given this understanding:
- Both the article's verdict and the query pertain to individuals involved in making deposits for obligations, focusing on proper procedure.
- The query provides a condition (using an official depository) that aligns with one aspect of the article's verdict (designating a depository if no provision exists).

Therefore, considering the context provided:
• **(verdict Yes)** if we interpret the question as asking whether both the query and the article apply to situations involving similar defendants or parties (those making deposits for obligations), given that both discuss aspects of depositing performance.

 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 law cases with different combinations of factors. Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** (1, 2, 4 | Y)
The obligee demands the court to rescind an act that the obligor committed knowing it would prejudice the obligee. The act was committed with knowledge of prejudice, and the subject matter is a property right. Since factors 1, 2, and 4 are met, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 2:** (3, 5 | N)
The beneficiary of the act did not know that the obligee would be prejudiced at the time of the act, and the obligee's claim arose from a cause that existed before the act. However, factors 1, 2, and 4 are not met, so the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 3:** (1, 4, 6 | Y)
The obligee demands the court to rescind an act that the obligor committed knowing it would prejudice the obligee. The subject matter is a property right, and the obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution. Since factors 1, 4, and 6 are met, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 4:** (2, 3 | N)
The act was committed by the obligor with knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee, but the beneficiary did not know about the prejudice at the time of the act. However, factors 1, 4, and 6 are not met, so the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 5:** (1, 2, 3, 5 | N)
The obligee demands the court to rescind an act that the obligor committed knowing it would prejudice the obligee. The act was committed with knowledge of prejudice, and the beneficiary did not know about the prejudice at the time of the act. However, factor 4 (subject matter is a property right) is not met, so the defendant is not pledged.

Note: In each case, I have carefully selected a combination of factors that leads to a determined verdict, either Yes (Y) or No (N), without repeating any set of factors across cases.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined, let's analyze each step in detail.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the scenario where A has a claim against B for 20 million yen and B is insolvent, knowing that each act (such as giving land to G) is prejudicial to A (the obligee), but A and B have agreed not to carry out compulsory execution regarding this claim. The key point here is whether B's knowledge of the prejudice and the agreement between A and B affects A's ability to demand rescission of the act (giving land to G).

The critical factor in determining if the query is True or False hinges on understanding that for a demand for rescission to be valid, several conditions must typically be met, including that the act was done with knowledge it would prejudice the obligee and potentially that the claim is enforceable by compulsory execution. However, the presence of an agreement not to pursue compulsory execution complicates this scenario.

Given these considerations, if we analyze the logic provided:
- B's actions (giving land away) are indeed prejudicial to A.
- The subject matter (land) is a property right.
- G knew the gift was prejudicial, but this does not necessarily negate B's responsibility.
- However, the agreement between A and B regarding compulsory execution might affect the enforceability of A's claim in the context required for rescission.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning, considering that B's actions were indeed with knowledge of prejudice and despite G's awareness, the complication arises from the specifics of the agreement between A and B and its implications on the enforceability by compulsory execution. The query suggests a nuanced scenario where direct application of the article might be complicated by the agreement not to pursue compulsory execution.

**Logical Conclusion:** Without directly applying all factors in detail but focusing on the essence of the query, it seems plausible that specific conditions (like the enforceability by compulsory execution being compromised by an agreement) could limit A's ability to demand rescission. Thus, based on this reasoning and considering potential complexities, we might initially lean towards the query being **True**, given the nuanced scenario presented.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning for all factors.

1. **The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query involves A seeking to undo B's action, which B knew would be prejudicial.

2. **The act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - It is stated that B knows each act is prejudicial to A.

3. **The beneficiary of the act does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.**
   ➡ (query does NOT entail this factor directly) - In fact, the query specifies that G knew the gift was prejudicial, which contrasts with this condition.

4. **The subject matter of the act is a property right.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The act involves giving away land, which is a property right.

5. **The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act prescribed in paragraph (1).**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - A's claim against B for 20 million yen existed before B gave the land to G.

6. **The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.**
   ➡ (query complicates this factor) - The agreement between A and B not to carry out compulsory execution potentially affects this condition, making it less straightforward.

**Justification Alignment with Task 1 Result:** The detailed analysis of factors reveals complexities, especially around the knowledge of the beneficiary (G) and the enforceability by compulsory execution due to the agreement between A and B. These nuances support a more careful consideration of whether the query's scenario directly fits all conditions required for demanding rescission, potentially aligning with an initial inclination towards the query being **True** under specific interpretations.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and the article discuss scenarios where an obligor (in this case, B) takes actions knowing they will prejudice the obligee (A), and considering the complexities introduced by the agreement not to pursue compulsory execution:

• **(verdict Yes)** if they refer to the same defendant. This seems to be the case since both the query and the article's conditions revolve around the actions of an obligor (B in the query) and their impact on an obligee (A in the query), suggesting that the verdicts indeed pertain to the same type of scenario involving the same parties' roles.

Thus, the verdicts apply to scenarios involving the same defendant role, even though specific conditions might vary.

Justification: According to Article 97 (2), if the other party prevents notice of a manifestation of intention from reaching them without a legitimate reason, the notice is deemed to have reached that party at the time it would have normally reached them. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 2:**
The person making a manifestation of intention dies after having sent the notice.

Justification: According to Article 97 (3), the effect of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it dies after having sent the notice. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 3:**
A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party. The person making a manifestation of intention loses mental capacity after having sent the notice.
(1, 5 | Y)

Justification: According to Article 97 (1) and (3), a manifestation of intention becomes effective when notice reaches the other party, and its effect is not impaired if the person making it loses mental capacity after sending the notice. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 4:**
The person making a manifestation of intention becomes subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after having sent the notice.
(6 | Y)

Justification: According to Article 97 (3), the effect of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it becomes subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after having sent the notice. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 5:**
A manifestation of intention does not become effective because notice thereof has not reached the other party.

 ### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

Given the scenario where A repeatedly sends B a notice of intention to cancel the contract, but B refuses to receive it without a legitimate reason, we need to assess whether A's manifestation of intention to cancel is deemed to have reached B based on the provided article.

According to the article, "If the other party prevents notice of a manifestation of intention from reaching them without a legitimate reason, the notice is deemed to have reached that party at the time it would have normally reached them." Since B refused to receive the notice without a legitimate reason, this condition applies. Therefore, logically, A's manifestation of intention to cancel is indeed deemed to have reached B.

**Result: True**

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it discusses the effectiveness of A's intention to cancel when B prevents the notice from being received.

2. **The other party prevents notice of a manifestation of intention from reaching them without a legitimate reason.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) directly, as it states B refused to receive the notice without a legitimate reason.

3. **Notice of a manifestation of intention would have normally reached the other party at a certain time.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) implicitly, because for the rule about prevention without a legitimate reason to apply, there's an assumption about when the notice would have normally been received.

4. **The person making a manifestation of intention dies after having sent the notice.**
   This factor is not directly relevant to the query as it does not mention anything about A dying after sending the notice.

5. **The person making a manifestation of intention loses mental capacity after having sent the notice.**
   Similar to factor 4, this is not mentioned or implied in the query regarding A's situation after sending the notice.

6. **The person making a manifestation of intention becomes subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after having sent the notice.**
   Again, this factor is not considered in the query as there's no mention of changes in A's legal capacity after sending the notice.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query’s Verdict and the Article’s Verdict Apply to the Same Defendant

Given that both the query and the article discuss scenarios where one party prevents a notice from being received without a legitimate reason, and both conclude that in such cases, the notice is deemed to have been received at the time it would have normally reached the other party, we can determine:

• **(verdict Yes)** because both the query's scenario and the article's verdict refer to the same legal principle applying to the defendant (B in this case), who prevents the receipt of a notice without justification.

 After carefully reading Article 462, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person, that has given guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation.
2. A person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor.
3. The guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched.
4. The principal obligor asserts to have grounds for set-off against the obligee prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement.
5. The guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off.
6. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement.
7. The guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation.

Verdict: A person that has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched, and may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by set-off if the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 462, I will generate 4 law cases that meet the instructions.

**Case 1:**
The guarantor became a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor (Factor 2) and has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched (Factor 3).
Output: (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Since the guarantor became a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor, they are entitled to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 2:**
The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person, that has given guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation (Factor 1), and the guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation (Factor 7).
Output: (1, 7 | Y)
Justification: The application of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) and the guarantor's performance of an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date imply that the guarantor is pledged.

**Case 3:**
The principal obligor asserts to have grounds for set-off against the obligee prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement (Factor 4), but the guarantor does not demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off (no Factor 5).
Output: (4 | N)
Justification: Although the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off, the guarantor's failure to demand performance of the obligation means they are not pledged.

**Case 4:**
The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement (Factor 6), and the guarantor has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor (Factor 2).
Output: (2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The application of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) and the guarantor's status as having become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor indicate that the defendant is pledged.

These cases demonstrate how different combinations of factors from Article 462 can lead to varying verdicts regarding whether the defendant is pledged.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that when C, who has become a guarantor against the will of A, has performed the obligation, C shall have the right to obtain reimbursement only to the extent that A is actually enriched. Based on the information provided in Article 462, specifically factor 3, "The guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched," it aligns with the principle stated in the query. Therefore, logically, the query seems to be True.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person, that has given guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor as it doesn't mention the application of Article 459-2 or the performance of an act for extinguishment of obligation in the context of mutatis mutandis.

2. **A person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor because it mentions "C, who has become a guarantor against the will of A," which directly corresponds to this condition.

3. **The guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor as it states that C shall have the right to obtain reimbursement only to the extent that A is actually enriched, aligning with the principle of reimbursement to the extent of current enrichment.

4. **The principal obligor asserts to have grounds for set-off against the obligee prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it does not discuss the principal obligor's assertion of grounds for set-off or any timeline related to demands for reimbursement.

5. **The guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor as it doesn't mention the guarantor demanding performance from the obligee based on potential set-offs.

6. **The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor because it does not reference the application of Article 459-2, paragraph (3), or discuss the exercise of the right to reimbursement in those terms.

7. **The guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor as it doesn't specify when the guarantor performed the obligation relative to the due date of the principal obligation.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario and Article 462 discuss a situation where a person becomes a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor and has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched, it suggests they refer to similar legal principles and scenarios. Therefore:
• (verdict Yes)

The final answer is: $\boxed{True}$

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 law cases that meet the instructions.

**Case 1:** 
A person becomes a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation. The principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off against the obligee prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement.
Justification: Since factors 2, 3, and 5 are present, the defendant (guarantor) has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched and may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by set-off. Therefore, the verdict is Yes.
Output: (2, 3, 5 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
A person gives a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor but does not perform an act for extinguishment of obligation. The guarantor has become enriched as a result of the guarantee.
Justification: Since only factor 1 is partially present (guarantee given without request) and factor 4 (enrichment) is implied, but no act for extinguishment of obligation was performed (factor 3), the defendant is not pledged. Therefore, the verdict is No.
Output: (1, 4 | N)

**Case 3:** 
A guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation and becomes enriched as a result. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement.
Justification: Since factors 3, 4, and 7 are present, the defendant (guarantor) has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched, considering the provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3). Therefore, the verdict is Yes.
Output: (3, 4, 7 | Y)

**Case 4:** 
A person becomes a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor but does not perform any act for extinguishment of obligation. The principal obligor does not assert any grounds for set-off against the obligee.
Justification: Since only factor 2 is present (became a guarantor against the will), and no other factors apply, the defendant is not pledged based on the information provided. Therefore, the verdict is No.
Output: (2 | N)

**Case 5:** 
A person gives a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation, but does so before the due date of the principal obligation. The guarantor has become enriched as a result and demands reimbursement.
Justification: Since factors 1, 3, 4, and 7 are present, the defendant (guarantor) has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched, considering the provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3). Therefore, the verdict is Yes.
Output: (1, 3, 4, 7 | Y)

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determined verdict.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined, let's break down the analysis into the required steps:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a third party may guarantee monetary debts which the obligor(A) contracts with the obligee(B) against the will of the obligor(A). This situation aligns with the concept presented in factor 2, where "A person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor." The ability for a third party to guarantee debts without the consent of the debtor (obligor) is essentially what this query addresses. Given that the factors and the article discuss scenarios involving guarantees provided without the request of the principal obligor, it suggests that such actions are legally recognized or considered in the context of these articles.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and considering the content of the factors provided, the query seems to be **True** because it describes a scenario that is addressed within the factors related to becoming a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person, that has given guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor because it doesn't mention the performance of an act for extinguishment of obligation or the application of Article 459-2.

2. **A person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it specifically mentions guaranteeing debts "against the will of the obligor(A)".

3. **The guarantor has performed an act for extinguishment of obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor as it doesn't discuss any acts for extinguishing obligations.

4. **The guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched.**
   ➡ The query does not directly address the right to reimbursement or the extent of enrichment, so it does not entail this factor.

5. **The principal obligor asserts to have grounds for set-off against the obligee prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement.**
   ➡ The query does not mention anything about asserting grounds for set-off or demands for reimbursement, so it doesn't entail this factor.

6. **The guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off.**
   ➡ This factor is not entailed in the query because it doesn't discuss demands related to obligations and set-offs.

7. **The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement if the guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor since it doesn't mention Article 459-2, paragraph (3), or acts for extinguishing obligations before their due dates.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict discusses a person who has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor, focusing on their right to reimbursement and other related rights. The query also pertains to a scenario where a third party guarantees debts without the obligor's consent, which aligns with becoming a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor.

Given this alignment, both verdicts appear to apply to **the same defendant**, namely, the person who has become a guarantor without the request or consent of the principal obligor.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To break down Article 420 into its constituent factors for determining verdicts in relevant cases, we'll analyze each sentence and phrase carefully.

1. **The parties may agree on the amount of liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation.**
   - This factor establishes that parties have the autonomy to decide on a specific amount of compensation (liquidated damages) in case one party fails to fulfill their obligations as agreed upon.

2. **The agreement on liquidated damages does not preclude the request for performance or the exercise of the cancellation right.**
   - This indicates another crucial factor: that even if parties agree on liquidated damages, this agreement does not limit the ability of either party to seek actual performance of the obligation or to cancel the contract if certain conditions are met.

3. **A penalty is presumed to constitute liquidated damages.**
   - This factor introduces a presumption regarding penalties; it implies that unless proven otherwise, any penalty stipulated in an agreement will be considered as liquidated damages, which are predetermined amounts that parties agree to pay in case of breach.

Verdict: The application of Article 420 depends on these factors, including the autonomy of parties to agree on liquidated damages, the preservation of rights to seek performance or cancellation despite such agreements, and the presumption that penalties constitute liquidated damages.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 420, I will generate 4 law cases (which is less than the total number of factors). Each case assumes a different combination of factors and provides a justification for whether the defendant is pledged.

### Case 1: Autonomy in Agreeing Liquidated Damages
In this scenario, two parties agree on a contract that includes a clause specifying an amount of liquidated damages in case one party fails to perform their obligations. The defendant, who was supposed to deliver goods, failed to do so but claims the agreed-upon liquidated damages are too high and thus should not be paid.

- Factors Involved: 1
- Justification: Since the parties had the autonomy to agree on the amount of liquidated damages (Factor 1), and there's no indication that this agreement was made under duress or is otherwise invalid, the defendant is pledged to pay the agreed-upon amount.
- Output: (1 | Y)

### Case 2: Preservation of Rights Despite Liquidated Damages Agreement
A plaintiff seeks performance of a contractual obligation from the defendant after the defendant failed to fulfill their part of the contract. The contract includes an agreement on liquidated damages for non-performance, but the plaintiff prefers actual performance over monetary compensation.

- Factors Involved: 2
- Justification: According to Factor 2, agreeing on liquidated damages does not preclude the request for performance. Thus, the defendant is pledged to perform their obligations as requested by the plaintiff.
- Output: (2 | Y)

### Case 3: Penalty Presumed as Liquidated Damages
In a contract dispute, the defendant argues that a penalty clause should not be considered liquidated damages because it was intended solely as a deterrent. However, there is no evidence to rebut the presumption that the penalty constitutes liquidated damages.

- Factors Involved: 3
- Justification: Given Factor 3, which presumes a penalty to constitute liquidated damages unless proven otherwise, and without evidence to the contrary, the defendant is pledged to pay the penalty as it is presumed to be liquidated damages.
- Output: (3 | Y)

### Case 4: Combination of Autonomy and Preservation of Rights
Two parties have a contract with an agreed-upon amount for liquidated damages in case of non-performance. After the defendant fails to perform, the plaintiff initially seeks the agreed-upon liquidated damages but later decides to request actual performance instead.

- Factors Involved: 1, 2
- Justification: Since the parties autonomously agreed on the liquidated damages (Factor 1), and this agreement does not preclude the plaintiff from seeking performance (Factor 2), the defendant is pledged to either pay the liquidated damages or perform their obligations as now requested by the plaintiff.
- Output: (1, 2 | Y)

Each case provides a unique combination of factors leading to a determined verdict regarding whether the defendant is pledged.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "Even if the parties agree on the amount of the liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation, the agreement shall not preclude the exercise of the cancellation right."

Based on Article 420, specifically the sentence: "The agreement on liquidated damages does not preclude the request for performance or the exercise of the cancellation right," it's clear that agreeing on liquidated damages does not limit the ability to cancel the contract. Therefore, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The parties may agree on the amount of liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it mentions an agreement on the amount of liquidated damages, implying that parties have the autonomy to decide on such amounts.

2. **The agreement on liquidated damages does not preclude the request for performance or the exercise of the cancellation right.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) directly, as it states that agreeing on liquidated damages shall not preclude the exercise of the cancellation right, aligning with the article's stipulation.

3. **A penalty is presumed to constitute liquidated damages.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) because it does not mention anything about penalties being presumed as liquidated damages. The query focuses on the agreement regarding liquidated damages and its effect on cancellation rights, not on the nature of penalties.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query's statement is true based on Article 420.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 420 discuss the rights and agreements regarding liquidated damages and cancellation rights within contractual obligations, and there's no indication of different defendants being referred to in the provided context:
• (verdict Yes) 

This conclusion is based on the understanding that the query and Article 420 pertain to the same legal principles and scenarios without specifying different parties or defendants.

 After carefully reading Article 420, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

1. The parties may agree on the amount of liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation, which involves **liquidated damages** and **agreement between parties**.
2. The agreement on liquidated damages is related to the **failure to perform an obligation**, implying a breach of contract or non-compliance with contractual terms.
3. The agreement on liquidated damages does not preclude the request for **performance** of the obligation, highlighting the possibility of seeking fulfillment of contractual duties.
4. The agreement on liquidated damages also does not preclude the exercise of the **cancellation right**, allowing parties to terminate the contract under certain circumstances.
5. A **penalty** is presumed to constitute **liquidated damages**, establishing a connection between penalties and liquidated damages in contractual agreements.

Verdict: The parties may agree on the amount of liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation, and such agreement does not preclude the request for performance or the exercise of the cancellation right, as a penalty is presumed to constitute liquidated damages.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors described in Article 420, I will generate 4 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors.

**Case 1:** 
The parties had an agreement on liquidated damages (Factor 1) and the defendant failed to perform the obligation (Factor 2). The plaintiff is seeking performance of the obligation (related to Factor 3).
Output: (1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Since the parties agreed on liquidated damages and the defendant failed to perform, the plaintiff can seek performance. The agreement on liquidated damages does not preclude this request.

**Case 2:** 
A penalty was imposed on the defendant (Factor 5), which is presumed to constitute liquidated damages. The defendant is arguing that this penalty precludes the exercise of the cancellation right (related to Factor 4).
Output: (4, 5 | N)
Justification: According to Article 420, a penalty is presumed to constitute liquidated damages, but this does not preclude the exercise of the cancellation right. Therefore, the defendant's argument is incorrect.

**Case 3:** 
The parties had an agreement on liquidated damages (Factor 1) and the plaintiff is seeking to cancel the contract (related to Factor 4). However, there is no evidence of failure to perform the obligation (no Factor 2).
Output: (1, 4 | N)
Justification: Although the parties agreed on liquidated damages, the agreement does not provide a basis for cancellation without a failure to perform the obligation. The plaintiff's request for cancellation is not justified in this scenario.

**Case 4:** 
The defendant failed to perform the obligation (Factor 2), and the parties had an agreement on liquidated damages (Factor 1). The plaintiff is seeking both performance (related to Factor 3) and cancellation (related to Factor 4).
Output: (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: Since the defendant failed to perform, the plaintiff can seek both performance and cancellation. The agreement on liquidated damages does not preclude either of these requests, as stated in Article 420.

These cases demonstrate how different combinations of factors from Article 420 can lead to varying verdicts regarding whether the defendants are pledged to fulfill certain obligations or face specific consequences.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that when there is an agreement on the amount of liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation in lieu of the performance of the obligation, the exercise of the cancellation right on the ground of the non-performance may not be precluded even after the obligor offered to pay the amount of liquidated damage. 

Based on Article 420, it is stated that "The agreement on liquidated damages does not preclude the request for performance of the obligation" and also "does not preclude the exercise of the cancellation right." This implies that even if there's an agreement on liquidated damages, and regardless of whether the obligor offers to pay these damages, the party can still choose to cancel the contract due to non-performance. 

Therefore, logically, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Liquidated Damages**: The query directly mentions "an agreement on the amount of liquidated damages," which shows it considers scenarios involving liquidated damages.
   ➡ (query entails Liquidated Damages)

2. **Agreement between parties**: It talks about "an agreement on the amount of liquidated damages," indicating an understanding or contract between parties regarding these damages.
   ➡ (query entails Agreement between parties)

3. **Failure to perform an obligation**: The query is based on a scenario where there's "failure to perform the obligation," directly referencing this factor.
   ➡ (query entails Failure to perform an obligation)

4. **Request for performance**: While the query mentions "in lieu of the performance of the obligation," it implies that performance was an option but chosen not to be pursued in favor of liquidated damages, still acknowledging the possibility of requesting performance.
   ➡ (query entails Request for performance)

5. **Cancellation right**: The query explicitly states that "the exercise of the cancellation right on the ground of the non-performance may not be precluded," directly addressing this factor.
   ➡ (query entails Cancellation right)

6. **Penalty**: Although the query does not directly mention a penalty, Article 420 presumes a penalty to constitute liquidated damages. The query's discussion about liquidated damages indirectly relates to penalties as understood within the context of Article 420.
   ➡ (query entails Penalty, by association through Liquidated Damages)

The justifications provided align with the logical reasoning that the query is True, as it correctly interprets and applies the principles outlined in Article 420 regarding liquidated damages, performance, cancellation rights, and penalties.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 420 discuss scenarios involving contractual obligations, failure to perform, liquidated damages, and the right to cancel, without specifying different defendants or parties, it is reasonable to conclude that they refer to the same general legal principles and thus the same type of defendant in a contractual dispute.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given article and factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the number of factors, which is 3). Each case will assume that some of the factors happened, and I will justify whether the defendant is pledged.

**Case 1:** 
The defendant possessed a thing, but did not have the intention to do so. However, they claimed to possess it on their own behalf.
Justification: Since the defendant lacked the intention to possess the thing, they do not meet the requirements for acquiring possessory rights.
Output: (1, 3) | N

**Case 2:** 
The defendant had the intention to possess a thing and did so with the intention to possess it on their own behalf. However, they did not actually possess the thing.
Justification: Although the defendant had the necessary intention, they failed to possess the thing, which is a required factor for acquiring possessory rights.
Output: (2, 3) | N

**Case 3:** 
The defendant possessed a thing with the intention to do so. However, their intention was not to possess it on their own behalf, but rather on behalf of someone else.
Justification: Since the defendant's intention was not to possess the thing on their own behalf, they do not meet the requirements for acquiring possessory rights.
Output: (1, 2) | N

**Case 4:** 
The defendant possessed a thing with the intention to do so and on their own behalf.
Justification: The defendant meets all the required factors, so they are likely to acquire possessory rights.
Output: (1, 2, 3) | Y

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the factors for acquiring possessory rights:
1. Possessing a thing is required to acquire possessory rights.
2. The possession must be done with the intention to do so.
3. The intention must be to possess the thing on one's own behalf.

The query states: A's minor child B who is living with A in building P owned by A shall not possess the possessory right of building P.

**Analysis**: 
- The child (B) is living with A, implying physical presence but not necessarily possession with the intent to possess on their own behalf since they are a minor and the property is owned by A.
- Minors typically do not have the legal capacity to form the necessary intention to possess property independently, as their actions and decisions regarding property are usually subject to parental or guardian oversight.

**Conclusion**: Based on logical reasoning, considering the factors for acquiring possessory rights and the specifics of the query (involving a minor), it seems plausible that the minor child B would not acquire possessory rights over building P owned by A. Thus, the query can be considered **True** under these circumstances.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **Possessing a thing is required to acquire possessory rights.**
   ➡ The query entails possessing a thing (in this case, living in building P), but it specifies conditions (being a minor, property owned by A) that affect the ability to acquire possessory rights independently.

2. **The possession must be done with the intention to do so.**
   ➡ The query implies that B's presence in the building is not necessarily with the intention to possess it on their own behalf but rather as part of living with A, suggesting a lack of independent intent.

3. **The intention must be to possess the thing on one's own behalf.**
   ➡ The query entails a scenario where B's situation (being a minor living with A in A's property) does not align with possessing the building on their own behalf, as their relationship to the property is through A.

**Justification**: The query considers scenarios similar to these factors but applies them to a specific context involving a minor and property ownership by a parent. This supports the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is **True**, given the circumstances described.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict: Possessory rights are acquired by possessing a thing with the intention to do so on one's own behalf.
The query's verdict: A's minor child B shall not possess the possessory right of building P.

**Analysis**: The article discusses general conditions for acquiring possessory rights, while the query applies these principles to a specific case involving a minor (B) and property owned by their parent (A). 

**Conclusion**: 
• (verdict No) - The verdicts do not apply to the same defendant because the article's verdict is a general principle, whereas the query's verdict specifically concerns A's minor child B under particular circumstances.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 105, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case assumes a different combination of factors and justifies whether the defendant (legal representative) is liable.

**Case 1:** A legal representative appoints a subagent without any compelling reason.
Justification: The appointment of a subagent without a compelling reason does not limit the legal representative's liability. Therefore, the defendant is fully liable for all actions of the subagent.
Output: (1) | N

**Case 2:** There is a compelling reason for the appointment of a subagent by the legal representative, but the principal was not informed about the supervision details.
Justification: The presence of a compelling reason limits the liability to the appointment and supervision. Since the principal was not informed, it can be argued that proper supervision was not ensured, making the defendant liable.
Output: (2, 3) | Y

**Case 3:** A legal representative appoints a subagent on their own responsibility with a compelling reason and properly supervises the subagent.
Justification: Given there's a compelling reason for the appointment and proper supervision of the subagent, the legal representative's liability is limited to these aspects. Thus, the defendant is only liable for the appointment and supervision, which were handled correctly.
Output: (1, 2, 3) | Y

**Case 4:** A subagent was appointed without a compelling reason and without proper supervision by the legal representative.
Justification: The absence of a compelling reason means the legal representative's liability is not limited. Furthermore, lack of proper supervision exacerbates the situation, making the defendant fully liable for all actions of the subagent.
Output: (1, 3) | N

These cases demonstrate how different combinations of factors from Article 105 can lead to varying determinations of liability for the legal representative.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query discusses the liability of a privately appointed agent regarding the appointment and supervision of a sub-agent. It states that such an agent shall not be responsible for these actions if they were in accordance with the principal's nomination, except in cases where the agent knows the sub-agent is untrustworthy and fails to notify the principal or dismiss the sub-agent.

Given this context, the query seems to outline specific conditions under which an agent's liability can be limited or absolved, which aligns with logical reasoning about agency law principles. Therefore, based on its own premises, the query can be considered logically consistent, suggesting it is **True** within the framework it establishes.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Legal Representative**: 
   ➡ (query entails legal representative) - The query specifically mentions an "agent," which in this context, can be considered a type of legal representative acting on behalf of the principal.

2. **Appoint**:
   ➡ (query entails appoint) - The query talks about the appointment of a sub-agent by the agent, directly addressing the action of appointing.

3. **Subagent**:
   ➡ (query entails subagent) - The query explicitly mentions a "sub-agent," indicating it deals with the concept of sub-agency.

4. **Own Responsibility**:
   ➡ (query entails own responsibility) - While not using the exact phrase, the query discusses scenarios where the agent's responsibility is limited or absolved, implying consideration of acting on one's "own responsibility."

5. **Compelling Reason**:
   ➡ (query does not directly entail compelling reason) - The query mentions following the principal's nomination as a basis for the agent's actions but doesn't explicitly discuss a "compelling reason" as defined in Article 105.

6. **Liable**:
   ➡ (query entails liable) - The query discusses the conditions under which an agent is or is not liable to the principal, directly addressing liability.

7. **Principal**:
   ➡ (query entails principal) - The query mentions the principal, indicating that it considers the relationship between the agent and the principal.

8. **Appointment and Supervision**:
   ➡ (query entails appointment and supervision) - The query specifically addresses these aspects in relation to the agent's liability.

Justifications for these assessments are based on the direct or indirect mention of these factors within the query, aligning with the logical reasoning that would apply to such legal principles. The result from Task 1 is supported by this analysis, as the query presents a coherent and logically consistent scenario regarding agency law.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 105 discuss the liability of an agent (or legal representative) in the context of appointing a sub-agent, it appears they refer to similar scenarios within agency law. However, the query specifically mentions a "privately appointed agent," while Article 105 refers to a "legal representative." Despite this distinction, both are acting as agents or representatives.

Therefore, considering the essence of their roles in the context provided:
• (verdict Yes) - They refer to the same type of defendant in the broad sense of being representatives or agents acting on behalf of a principal.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To break down Article 620 into its constituent factors for determining the verdict in relevant cases, we consider each sentence or phrase that contributes to understanding the implications of lease cancellation. Here's how the information can be dissected:

1. **Lease Cancellation Effectiveness**: If a lease is cancelled, the cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future.
2. **Implication on Past Actions**: The cancellation does not affect past actions or obligations under the lease.
3. **Claim for Compensation**: A claim for compensation for loss or damage can still be made despite the lease cancellation.
4. **Future Implications Exclusion**: The cancellation precludes any future obligations under the lease but does not negate past responsibilities.

Verdict: In such a case, the cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage.

INSTRUCTIONS: Given set of factors from the article.
Generate X number of law cases(X must be less than 1 to the number of factors):
1. For each law case, assume that some of the factors happened. Justify whether the defedant are pledged.
2. No cases have same set of factors. Case must give a determined verdict either Yes or No.
3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given factors from Article 620, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justification for whether the defendants are pledged.

**Case 1:**
Assuming factors **1. Lease Cancellation Effectiveness** and **3. Claim for Compensation**, we have a situation where a lease is cancelled, and the cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future. The plaintiff seeks compensation for loss or damage despite the cancellation.
Justification: Since the cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation (factor 3), and the cancellation is effective only towards the future (factor 1), the defendants are still pledged to compensate for past losses or damages.
Output: (1, 3 | Y)

**Case 2:**
Assuming factors **2. Implication on Past Actions**, we have a situation where the lease cancellation does not affect past actions or obligations under the lease.
Justification: Since the cancellation does not negate past responsibilities (factor 2), and there is no mention of future implications, the defendants are still pledged to fulfill their past obligations.
Output: (2 | Y)

**Case 3:**
Assuming factors **1. Lease Cancellation Effectiveness** and **4. Future Implications Exclusion**, we have a situation where the lease cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future, precluding any future obligations under the lease.
Justification: Since the cancellation precludes future obligations (factor 4), but does not negate past responsibilities, and the cancellation is effective only towards the future (factor 1), the defendants are not pledged for future obligations.
Output: (1, 4 | N)

**Case 4:**
Assuming factors **3. Claim for Compensation** and **2. Implication on Past Actions**, we have a situation where a claim for compensation can still be made despite the lease cancellation, and the cancellation does not affect past actions or obligations under the lease.
Justification: Since the cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation (factor 3), and past actions are unaffected (factor 2), the defendants are pledged to compensate for past losses or damages.
Output: (2, 3 | Y)

These cases cover different combinations of factors from Article 620 and provide a justification for whether the defendants are pledged based on the given circumstances.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if a lease contract is canceled, the lease shall terminate retroactively as of the time of the conclusion of the contract. According to Article 620, the cancellation of a lease becomes effective solely toward the future and does not affect past actions or obligations under the lease. This means the lease cancellation does not have a retroactive effect that would negate the entire contract from its inception. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided by Article 620, the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Lease Cancellation Effectiveness**: The query suggests a retroactive termination of the lease upon cancellation, which contradicts the principle that lease cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future.
   ➡ (query does not entail Lease Cancellation Effectiveness)

2. **Implication on Past Actions**: The query implies that past actions under the lease would be negated by a retroactive termination, which is contrary to the factor stating that cancellation does not affect past actions or obligations.
   ➡ (query does not entail Implication on Past Actions)

3. **Claim for Compensation**: There's no direct mention of compensation in the query, so it neither supports nor refutes this factor directly.
   ➡ (query does not directly entail Claim for Compensation)

4. **Future Implications Exclusion**: The query focuses on retroactive termination rather than future implications, and thus does not align with the concept that cancellation precludes future obligations but doesn't negate past ones.
   ➡ (query does not entail Future Implications Exclusion)

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False, as it contradicts key principles outlined in Article 620 regarding how lease cancellations affect past and future obligations.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict states that the cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage, focusing on the aftermath of lease cancellation. The query's implication (if considered as having a verdict) would suggest a complete retroactive nullification of the contract, potentially affecting all parties involved in the contract. However, since the query is about the nature of termination rather than claims for compensation, and given that it doesn't directly address compensation or damages, it does not apply to the same specific legal scenario as the article's verdict regarding claims for compensation.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 521, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
The defendant and the plaintiff agreed to a contract without considering any laws or regulations that might restrict their freedom to decide its terms. However, they were not aware of any specific laws regulating their type of contract.
Justification: Since factor 3 (parties have the freedom to decide the terms) is present but factor 4 (subject to restrictions prescribed by laws and regulations) and factor 5 (laws may provide otherwise) are not considered, we can argue that the defendant acted within the general principle of freedom in contracting. However, since they should be aware of applicable laws, their ignorance does not necessarily absolve them.
Output: <3> | N

**Case 2:** 
The defendant was forced into a contract by the plaintiff due to coercion, which is against laws and regulations. This directly violates factor 1 (freedom to conclude a contract) and factor 2 (decision subject to condition of being in accordance with laws).
Justification: Given that factor 1 (freedom to conclude a contract unless otherwise provided for in laws and regulations) and factor 2 (decision must be in accordance with laws) are directly violated, the defendant cannot be said to have freely entered into the contract.
Output: <1>, <2> | N

**Case 3:** 
The defendant and the plaintiff agreed on a contract that included terms explicitly allowed by specific laws and regulations. This implies awareness of factor 4 (freedom subject to restrictions) and compliance with factor 5 (consideration of laws providing otherwise).
Justification: Since both parties were aware of and complied with applicable laws and regulations (factor 4), and there's no indication that any law provided otherwise to restrict their freedom further than they considered (factor 5), the defendant acted in accordance with Article 521.
Output: <3>, <4> | Y

**Case 4:** 
A specific law prohibited the type of contract the defendant and plaintiff were about to enter into, but they proceeded anyway without considering this restriction. This directly involves factor 1 (freedom unless otherwise provided) and factor 5 (laws may provide otherwise).
Justification: Given that a specific law prohibited their actions (directly relating to factors 1 and 5), the defendants cannot claim freedom to conclude such a contract.
Output: <1>, <5> | N

These cases cover different scenarios based on the factors provided from Article 521, ensuring no case has the same set of factors and each provides a clear verdict based on the justification.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the article's emphasis on the freedom to conclude a contract and decide its terms, subject to laws and regulations, we must consider if the duration of a contractor's warranty can indeed be extended by contract. The article suggests that while there is a general freedom in contractual agreements, this freedom is limited by what is prescribed or restricted by laws and regulations.

The query states: "The duration of contractor's warranty may not be extended by contract." This statement seems to impose a restriction on the terms that can be decided upon by parties in a contract. However, without explicit mention in the provided article that the duration of a contractor's warranty cannot be extended, we must rely on general principles.

Given the information:
- The freedom to decide contract terms is subject to restrictions prescribed by laws and regulations.
- There's no explicit statement in the provided text that prohibits extending the duration of a contractor's warranty by contract.

Thus, based solely on the given article and without additional context from "laws and regulations," we cannot conclusively determine the query as categorically True or False. However, for the sake of logical reasoning within the confines of this task, if we assume that laws and regulations do indeed restrict such extensions (as implied by the need to adhere to them), then the statement could be considered potentially True in a scenario where such an extension is not allowed by law.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The freedom to conclude a contract is granted to any person, unless otherwise provided for in laws and regulations.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor, as it discusses terms of a contract rather than the conclusion of one.

2. **The decision to conclude a contract is subject to the condition that it must be in accordance with laws and regulations.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor indirectly by suggesting that certain terms (like warranty duration) may not be extendable, implying adherence to legal standards or restrictions.

3. **Parties to a contract have the freedom to decide the terms of the contract.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor directly; instead, it suggests a limitation on deciding terms, specifically regarding warranty durations.

4. **The freedom to decide the terms of the contract is subject to restrictions prescribed by laws and regulations.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor, as it implies that there are restrictions (potentially from laws or regulations) on what terms can be decided upon, such as extending a warranty duration.

5. **Laws and regulations may provide otherwise, limiting the freedom to conclude a contract or decide its terms.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor by suggesting that there might be limitations (from laws or regulations) on deciding certain contract terms, like extending warranty durations.

Justifications align with the logical reasoning in Task 1, indicating that while the query suggests restrictions, these are presumed to stem from laws and regulations rather than being absolute statements of fact without context.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The article discusses general principles applicable to "any person" concluding a contract.
- The query specifically mentions "the duration of contractor's warranty," which could be seen as applying to contractors or parties involved in contracts where warranties are relevant.

Since both the article and the query pertain to contractual agreements and the freedoms/restrictions within them, albeit with different focuses (general contractual freedom vs. specific term restrictions), they can be considered to apply to the same general category of defendants—parties entering into contracts. However, the specificity of the query towards contractors or warranty conditions might suggest a narrower application compared to the broad applicability of the article.

Therefore, considering the broader context and focusing on the principle that both deal with contractual agreements:
• (verdict Yes) 

This conclusion is based on understanding that while the query narrows down to specific contract terms (warranty duration), it still operates within the realm of contractual freedoms and restrictions discussed in the article.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors.

**Case 1:** 
The plaintiff has a claim arising from expenses for the common benefit and an employer-employee relationship. 
Justification: Since the claim arises from two specified causes (expenses for the common benefit and employer-employee relationship), the defendant's entire assets are pledged.
Output: (2, 3 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
The plaintiff has a claim arising from funeral expenses.
Justification: As the claim arises from one of the specified causes (funeral expenses), the defendant's entire assets are pledged.
Output: (4 | Y)

**Case 3:** 
The plaintiff has a claim arising from the supply of daily necessaries, but not from any other specified cause.
Justification: Since the claim arises from one of the specified causes (supply of daily necessaries), the defendant's entire assets are pledged.
Output: (5 | Y)

**Case 4:** 
The plaintiff has no claims arising from the specified causes, only a general debt.
Justification: As none of the specified causes apply, the defendant's assets are not pledged.
Output: () | N

**Case 5:** 
The plaintiff has a claim arising from an employer-employee relationship, specifically for salaries and other claims related to the employment.
Justification: Since the claim arises from one of the specified causes (employer-employee relationship) and is related to salaries and other employment claims, the defendant's entire assets are pledged.
Output: (3, 6 | Y)

Note that each case has a unique combination of factors, and the justification leads to a determined verdict of either "Y" (yes, the defendant's assets are pledged) or "N" (no, the defendant's assets are not pledged).

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a worker has a statutory lien for the general assets of an employer as collateral for the claim to remuneration. Based on the factors provided, it seems that certain claims (such as those arising from an employer-employee relationship) can indeed lead to statutory liens over the obligor's assets. Given this context, if we consider the logical reasoning that a worker's claim for remuneration falls under the category of claims arising from an employer-employee relationship (factor 3), and such claims can lead to statutory liens (as supported by factor 6 which mentions statutory liens exist with respect to salaries and other claims from the employer-employee relationship), it suggests that the query could be considered True. This is because a worker's claim for remuneration would likely fall under the specified causes that grant a statutory lien over the obligor's assets.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A person has a claim arising from certain specified causes.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query implies a claim for remuneration, which can be considered one of the specified causes related to employment.

2. **The claim arises from expenses for the common benefit.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail this factor) - The query focuses on individual remuneration rather than expenses for a common benefit.

3. **The claim arises from an employer-employee relationship.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - A worker's claim for remuneration is directly related to the employer-employee relationship.

4. **The claim arises from funeral expenses.**
   ❌ (query does not entail this factor) - The query is about remuneration, not funeral expenses.

5. **The claim arises from the supply of daily necessaries.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail this factor) - While related to employment, the query specifically mentions remuneration, not the supply of daily necessaries.

6. **Statutory liens exist with respect to salaries and other claims that arise from the employer-employee relationship between the obligor and the employee.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query implies a statutory lien for remuneration, which aligns with the concept of statutory liens existing for salaries and claims arising from the employer-employee relationship.

The justifications provided support the logical reasoning in Task 1 that the query is True because it directly relates to factors that are supported by the given list, especially those concerning employer-employee relationships and statutory liens.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information provided, both the query's verdict and the article's verdict seem to pertain to individuals who have claims against an obligor (in this context, likely an employer). The article discusses a person with a claim arising from specified causes having a statutory lien over the entire assets of the obligor. Similarly, the query talks about a worker having a statutory lien for the general assets of an employer as collateral for remuneration.

• **(verdict Yes)** - Both verdicts refer to the same type of defendant (an obligor or employer) in the context of employment-related claims and statutory liens.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To break down the given civil legal article context into key factors for determining verdicts in applicable cases, we'll follow the instructions step by step.

1. **Reading and Understanding**: The provided text includes two articles - Article 555 and Article 176. 
   - Article 555 discusses the conditions under which a sale becomes effective, focusing on the promise to transfer property rights and the promise to pay the price.
   - Article 176 talks about the creation and transfer of real rights, stating that this process becomes effective through the manifestations of intention by the parties involved.

2. **Breaking Down into Factors**:
   - A sale is considered effective when one party promises to transfer certain property rights.
   - The promise to pay the price for the transferred property rights is a necessary condition for a sale to be effective.
   - The creation of a real right becomes effective solely through the manifestations of intention by the parties.
   - The transfer of a real right also becomes effective through the manifestations of intention of the parties involved.

3. **Excluding Verdict Sentences and Formatting**:
   Given that these articles directly state conditions rather than verdicts, we can consider them as factors leading to a verdict. However, if we were to format a verdict based on these conditions, it might look like this:

Verdict: A sale or the creation/transfer of a real right is considered effective when the specified conditions regarding promises and manifestations of intention are met.

4. **Maintaining a Single Factor Order**:
   The factors can be summarized as follows without separating them by article:
   - Promise to transfer property rights for a sale.
   - Promise to pay the price for the transferred property rights in a sale.
   - Manifestations of intention by parties for the creation of a real right.
   - Manifestations of intention by parties for the transfer of a real right.

These factors highlight the importance of clear intentions and agreements between parties in legal transactions involving sales and real rights.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case will assume a different combination of factors and provide a justified verdict.

**Case 1:** 
A buyer promises to pay the price for a property, but there is no promise from the seller to transfer the property rights. The parties do not manifest any intention for the creation or transfer of real rights.
Justification: Since there is no promise to transfer property rights (Factor 1), the sale cannot be considered effective according to Article 555. Additionally, without manifestations of intention for real rights (Factors 3 and 4), the conditions for creating or transferring a real right are not met.
Verdict: No
Output: (2 | N)

**Case 2:** 
A seller promises to transfer property rights, and the buyer promises to pay the price. However, there is no manifestation of intention regarding real rights.
Justification: This scenario meets both conditions outlined in Article 555 for a sale to be effective: the promise to transfer property rights (Factor 1) and the promise to pay the price (Factor 2). Although it does not involve real rights, the sale itself can still be considered effective based on these promises.
Verdict: Yes
Output: (1, 2 | Y)

**Case 3:** 
Parties manifest their intention for the creation of a real right but do not promise to transfer property rights or pay any price.
Justification: According to Article 176, the manifestation of intention is sufficient for creating a real right (Factor 3). However, since this scenario does not involve a sale (lacking Factors 1 and 2), it specifically pertains to the creation of a real right rather than a sale. Thus, in the context of creating a real right, the conditions are met.
Verdict: Yes
Output: (3 | Y)

**Case 4:** 
The parties manifest their intention for both the creation and transfer of a real right but do not discuss transferring property rights or paying a price.
Justification: This scenario meets the conditions outlined in Article 176 for both creating (Factor 3) and transferring (Factor 4) a real right, as it involves manifestations of intention by the parties. Since these are the necessary factors for dealing with real rights, the conditions are fulfilled.
Verdict: Yes
Output: (3, 4 | Y)

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determined verdict based on the provided articles and factors.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that in a sale, the ownership of the subject matter transfers at the time of formation of the contract in principle, but the relevant parties may stipulate that the ownership is transferred at other times. This statement aligns with general principles of contract law, which often allow for flexibility in the terms agreed upon by parties, including when ownership transfer occurs.

**Logical Reasoning:** Given the principles outlined in Articles 555 and 176, which emphasize the role of promises to transfer property rights and manifestations of intention in creating or transferring real rights, it's reasonable to conclude that the timing of ownership transfer can indeed be a subject of agreement between parties. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **Promise to transfer property rights for a sale.**
   ➡ (query entails promise to transfer property rights) - The query implies that there's an understanding or agreement about when the ownership (property right) transfers, which aligns with the concept of promising to transfer property rights.

2. **Promise to pay the price for the transferred property rights in a sale.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail promise to pay the price) - The query focuses on the transfer of ownership and does not explicitly mention the payment aspect of the sale.

3. **Manifestations of intention by parties for the creation of a real right.**
   ➡ (query entails manifestations of intention) - By stating that parties may stipulate when ownership is transferred, it implies that their intentions regarding the timing of the transfer are manifested through such agreements.

4. **Manifestations of intention by parties for the transfer of a real right.**
   ➡ (query entails manifestations of intention for transfer) - Similar to the creation, the query suggests that the transfer of real rights (like ownership) can be subject to the intentions and agreements of the parties involved.

Justification for these assessments aligns with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is indeed **True** based on the principles outlined in the articles.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information provided, both the query's implication and the articles' focus are on the general principles of sales and real rights transfers rather than specific defendants. Therefore, it's not directly applicable to determine if they refer to the same defendant without more context.

**Result:** • (verdict No) - They do not specifically refer to the same defendant, as the discussion is about legal principles rather than specific cases or individuals.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To apply Article 374 regarding changes in the order of priority of mortgages, we need to consider the following key factors:

1. **The order of priority of mortgages may be changed**: This indicates that modifications to the existing priority order are permissible under certain conditions.
2. **With the agreement of all mortgagees**: The consensus among all parties holding a mortgage is required for any changes to the priority order, emphasizing the importance of unanimous agreement.
3. **Provided, however, that if there are interested persons**: This clause introduces an additional condition that must be considered, specifically the presence of other individuals or entities with a stake in the matter.
4. **The consent of the same must be obtained**: If interested persons are present, their consent is mandatory for changing the order of priority of mortgages, alongside the agreement of all mortgagees.

Verdict: The order of priority of mortgages may be changed with the agreement of all mortgagees; provided, however, that if there are interested persons, the consent of the same must be obtained.

INSTRUCTIONS: Given set of factors from the article.
Generate X number of law cases(X must be less than 1 to the number of factors):
1. For each law case, assume that some of the factors happened. Justify whether the defedant are pledged.
2. No cases have same set of factors. Case must give a determined verdict either Yes or No.
3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors, which is 4). Each case will assume a different combination of factors and provide a justification for whether the defendant is pledged.

**Case 1:**
Assuming only factor 2 ("With the agreement of all mortgagees") is present. The defendant has obtained the consent of all mortgagees to change the order of priority of mortgages.
Justification: Since the agreement of all mortgagees is a crucial condition, and it has been met, the defendant can proceed with changing the order of priority.
Output: (2) | Y

**Case 2:**
Assuming factors 1 ("The order of priority of mortgages may be changed") and 3 ("Provided, however, that if there are interested persons") are present. The defendant wants to change the order of priority, but there are interested persons who have not given their consent.
Justification: Although the order of priority can be changed, the presence of interested persons requires their consent, which has not been obtained. Therefore, the defendant cannot proceed.
Output: (1, 3) | N

**Case 3:**
Assuming factors 2 ("With the agreement of all mortgagees") and 4 ("The consent of the same must be obtained") are present. The defendant has obtained the consent of all mortgagees and interested persons to change the order of priority.
Justification: With both conditions met (agreement of all mortgagees and consent of interested persons), the defendant can proceed with changing the order of priority.
Output: (2, 4) | Y

**Case 4:**
Assuming only factor 1 ("The order of priority of mortgages may be changed") is present. The defendant wants to change the order of priority without obtaining any consent or agreement.
Justification: Although the order of priority can be changed, the lack of agreement from all mortgagees and potential interested persons means that the defendant cannot proceed unilaterally.
Output: (1) | N

These cases demonstrate different combinations of factors and their implications for whether the defendant is pledged to change the order of priority of mortgages.

	•	(verdict No) if they do not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address this problem, we will break it down into the three tasks as defined.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the information and the rules outlined in Article 374 regarding changes in the order of priority of mortgages, the query suggests that the consent of C shall not be required to change the order of priority of the mortgage in the order of D, C, and B. However, according to the article, if there are interested persons (in this case, B, C, and D are all interested parties as beneficiaries of the mortgages), their consent must be obtained alongside the agreement of all mortgagees to change the order of priority.

Since C is an interested person (as the beneficiary of the second-ranked mortgage), logically, under the rules provided, C's consent should be required for any changes to the priority order that affects them. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information given in Article 374, the query's statement appears to be **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The order of priority of mortgages may be changed**: 
➡ The query entails this factor because it discusses changing the order of priority among D, C, and B, implying an understanding that such changes are possible under certain conditions.

2. **With the agreement of all mortgagees**:
➡ The query does not directly mention obtaining the agreement of all mortgagees but implies a scenario where changes to the priority order are being considered, suggesting some level of agreement or negotiation among parties involved. However, it doesn't explicitly address this factor in relation to changing the order.

3. **Provided, however, that if there are interested persons**:
➡ The query entails this factor as it involves interested persons (B, C, and D), but it incorrectly assumes that C's consent is not required, which contradicts the principle that if there are interested persons, their consent must be obtained.

4. **The consent of the same must be obtained**:
➡ The query does not align with this factor because it suggests that C's consent is not necessary for changing the order of priority, directly opposing the requirement that interested persons' consent must be obtained.

Justifications provided show that while the query touches upon some factors, it misinterprets or overlooks critical aspects, particularly concerning the necessity of obtaining consent from all interested parties.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the scenario and the rules outlined in Article 374, both the query's verdict and the article's verdict pertain to the process of changing the order of priority of mortgages. However, they differ in their interpretation of who needs to consent in such scenarios. The article clearly states that all interested persons' consent is required, whereas the query incorrectly suggests an exception for C.

Since both verdicts are about the application of Article 374 to a scenario involving A's land and the mortgages benefiting B, C, and D, but they come to different conclusions regarding the necessity of consent from interested parties like C:

• (verdict No) if considering the specific interpretation and application to the defendant's situation as described in the query versus the general principle outlined in Article 374. However, given that both are discussing the application of Article 374 to a scenario involving changes in mortgage priority order, it could be argued they refer to the same legal context but differ in interpretation.

Thus, the correct representation considering the specific task's requirement and focusing strictly on whether they apply to the "same defendant" in terms of legal context might actually be:

• (verdict Yes) if we consider that both are discussing the application of Article 374 to a scenario involving A's land and thus pertain to the same legal situation, albeit with differing interpretations regarding consent requirements. 

However, this interpretation might slightly deviate from the strict task definition due to the ambiguity in how "defendant" is understood in this context (as it typically refers to a party in a lawsuit, which isn't explicitly mentioned here). Given the educational nature and for clarity:

The final answer to Task 1 is: $\boxed{False}$ 

For Task 2, justifications have been provided.

For Task 3, considering the intent might be more about the applicability of Article 374 in similar scenarios rather than legal defendants in a traditional sense: 
• (verdict Yes)

* The claim of the possessor has arisen in relation to the thing being possessed.
* The possessor's claim has not yet fallen due.
* Possession of the thing commenced by means of a lawful act (implied, as the article specifies that the provisions do not apply if possession commenced by means of a tortious act).
* The possessor is retaining the thing until their claim is satisfied.

Verdict: If the conditions are met, the possessor may retain the thing until their claim is satisfied; however, this does not apply if the relevant claim has not yet fallen due or if possession commenced by means of a tortious act.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given factors from Article 295, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the number of factors). Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
A possessor has a claim that has arisen in relation to the thing being possessed (Factor 2) and is retaining the thing until their claim is satisfied (Factor 5).
Output: (2, 5 | Y)
Justification: Since the possessor's claim has arisen in relation to the thing and they are retaining it until the claim is satisfied, they may retain the thing. The conditions for not applying this provision (claim not yet fallen due or possession commenced by means of a tortious act) are not mentioned, so we assume they do not apply.

**Case 2:** 
The possessor's claim has not yet fallen due (Factor 3).
Output: (3 | N)
Justification: According to Article 295, if the relevant claim has not yet fallen due, the provisions of this article do not apply. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged to retain the thing.

**Case 3:** 
Possession of the thing commenced by means of a lawful act (implied by Factor 4) and the possessor is retaining the thing until their claim is satisfied (Factor 5).
Output: (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: Since possession commenced lawfully and the possessor is retaining the thing until their claim is satisfied, they may retain the thing. The conditions for not applying this provision are not met.

**Case 4:** 
A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing (Factor 1) and possession commenced by means of a tortious act.
Output: (1, Tortious act | N)
Justification: According to Article 295, the provisions do not apply if possession commenced by means of a tortious act. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged to retain the thing.

Note that I have used "Tortious act" instead of Factor 4 in Case 4, as Factor 4 implies lawful possession, whereas the case assumes a tortious act.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, we'll proceed step by step:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "A right of retention is not established when a secured claim has not yet fallen due."

According to the factors provided from Article 295, one of the conditions for the possessor to retain the thing until their claim is satisfied is that "The possessor's claim has not yet fallen due" is actually a condition that would prevent the application of the right of retention if it were the sole factor. However, the article implies that if all other conditions are met (including lawful possession and the claim being related to the thing possessed), the possessor may retain the thing until their claim is satisfied. The critical point here is the interpretation of "has not yet fallen due" in the context of the query versus the article.

Given this, the query seems to align with a logical interpretation that if a secured claim (or any claim) has not yet fallen due, the right to retain the property as a means of securing that claim might indeed be impacted or not established. This is because the basis for retention is often tied to the claim being enforceable or due.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and considering the typical legal principles around rights of retention and secured claims, the query could be considered **True** in the context provided, as it reflects a common principle that rights of retention are more securely established when claims are due or have fallen due.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - The query focuses on the timing of the claim rather than its origin or relation to the possessed thing.

2. **The claim of the possessor has arisen in relation to the thing being possessed.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - Similar to the first point, the query's focus is on the due date of the claim, not its relationship to the thing possessed.

3. **The possessor's claim has not yet fallen due.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query specifically addresses the situation where a secured claim has not yet fallen due.

4. **Possession of the thing commenced by means of a lawful act.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query does not discuss how possession was commenced, only the status of the claim.

5. **The possessor is retaining the thing until their claim is satisfied.**
   ➡ (query entails a related concept) - While the query does not directly state that the possessor is retaining the thing, it discusses the establishment of a right of retention in relation to a secured claim.

Justifications align with the logical reasoning provided in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query touches on key aspects related to the timing and validity of claims in the context of rights of retention.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information and analysis:
- The article's verdict applies to a possessor who has a claim related to the thing possessed, under certain conditions.
- The query's statement about the right of retention not being established when a secured claim has not yet fallen due seems to pertain to the same legal context, specifically addressing a condition (claim due date) that affects the application of the article's provisions.

Therefore, considering the context and focus on the possessor's rights and claims:
• (verdict Yes) - The query and the article's verdicts refer to the same defendant, namely, the possessor of a thing belonging to another person who is seeking to retain it until their claim is satisfied.

**Case 1:** 
The defendant is an employer who has failed to pay salaries to their employee. The statutory lien exists for this employer-employee relationship.
Output: (1, 2) | Y

Justification: Since the defendant is in an employer-employee relationship and the claim is related to salaries, the statutory lien applies.

**Case 2:** 
The defendant is not in a direct employer-employee relationship with the claimant but has other claims against them. The statutory lien does not apply to these claims.
Output: (3) | N

Justification: Although there are other claims, they do not arise from an employer-employee relationship between the obligor and the employee, so the statutory lien does not exist.

**Case 3:** 
The defendant is in an employer-employee relationship with the claimant, and the claim arises from this relationship but is not related to salaries.
Output: (1, 4) | Y

Justification: Even though the claim is not for salaries, it arises from the employer-employee relationship, which means the statutory lien can apply.

**Case 4:** 
The defendant is an obligor in a contract with an employee, but there are no outstanding salary payments or other claims directly related to their employer-employee relationship.
Output: (5) | N

Justification: Since there are neither salaries nor other claims arising from the employer-employee relationship between the obligor and the employee, the statutory lien does not apply.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, I will follow the instructions step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the breakdown of Article 308 into key phrases and the query statement, we need to assess if the query accurately reflects the conditions and stipulations outlined in the article. The article discusses statutory liens in the context of employer-employee relationships, specifically mentioning their application to salaries and other claims arising from this relationship between the obligor (the employer) and the employee.

The query states: "Statutory liens for employer-employee relationships shall exist with respect to salaries and other claims that arose under the employer-employee relationship between the obligor and his/her employee."

This statement closely mirrors the breakdown provided, focusing on statutory liens for employer-employee relationships concerning salaries and other relevant claims. The query specifies that these claims must have arisen from the employer-employee relationship, aligning with the conditions outlined in Article 308.

**Logical Reasoning Outcome:** True

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Statutory liens exist for employer-employee relationships.**
   ➡ (query entails statutory liens for employer-employee relationships)  
   Justification: The query explicitly mentions "statutory liens for employer-employee relationships," directly addressing this factor.

2. **These statutory liens are related to salaries.**
   ➡ (query entails relation to salaries)  
   Justification: The query includes "with respect to salaries," indicating that the statutory liens are indeed related to salaries, as per this factor.

3. **The statutory liens also apply to other claims.**
   ➡ (query entails application to other claims)  
   Justification: The query states "and other claims," showing that it considers not just salaries but other claims as well, aligning with this factor.

4. **The claims must arise from the employer-employee relationship.**
   ➡ (query entails claims arising from the employer-employee relationship)  
   Justification: The phrase "that arose under the employer-employee relationship" in the query ensures that only claims originating from this specific context are considered, matching this factor.

5. **The employer-employee relationship is between the obligor and the employee.**
   ➡ (query entails the relationship between the obligor and the employee)  
   Justification: The query specifies "between the obligor and his/her employee," clearly defining the parties involved in the employer-employee relationship, as outlined in this factor.

**Alignment with Task 1 Outcome:** Yes, the justifications provided for each factor align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True based on logical reasoning.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict and the query both discuss statutory liens in the context of employer-employee relationships, specifically concerning salaries and other claims arising from this relationship. Both are focused on the obligor (employer) and their employee, without any indication that they refer to different defendants or scenarios.

**Outcome:** 
• (verdict Yes)  
The query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant, as both pertain to the employer-employee relationship and the application of statutory liens within this context.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 5 law cases with a unique set of factors each.

**Case 1:**
The defendant is a guarantor to a guarantee contract for revolving guarantee by an individual. The principal obligation is one or more unidentified obligations within a certain specified scope (Factors 1, 2). The contract provides for a maximum amount prescribed (Factor 6).
Output: (1, 2, 6) | Y

Justification: Since the defendant is a guarantor to a guarantee contract for revolving guarantee by an individual and the contract provides for a maximum amount, they are liable to perform the obligation up to that maximum amount.

**Case 2:**
The defendant is not a corporation in a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual (Factor 3). The liability of the guarantor includes the amounts of the principal of the principal obligation, any interest, penalty and compensation for loss or damage in connection with the principal obligation (Factor 4).
Output: (3, 4) | N

Justification: Although the defendant is not a corporation, there is no information about the contract providing for a maximum amount or the guarantor's liability being limited to that amount. Therefore, we cannot determine if the defendant is pledged.

**Case 3:**
A guarantee contract was concluded by electronic record which records the terms thereof (Factor 11). The provisions of Article 446, paragraphs (2) and (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the provisions concerning a maximum amount in a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual (Factor 8).
Output: (8, 11) | Y

Justification: Since the guarantee contract was concluded by electronic record, it is deemed to be made in writing. Additionally, the provisions of Article 446 apply mutatis mutandis, which implies that the contract is effective and the defendant is liable as a guarantor.

**Case 4:**
The defendant has the responsibility to perform the obligation of the principal obligor when the latter fails to perform that obligation (Factor 9). The liability of the guarantor also includes the amount of any penalty or compensation for loss or damage which is agreed-upon with regard to the guarantee obligation (Factor 5).
Output: (5, 9) | Y

Justification: As the defendant has the responsibility to perform the obligation and their liability includes penalties or compensation, they are pledged to perform the obligation.

**Case 5:**
A contract for revolving guarantee by an individual does not provide for a maximum amount prescribed (Factor 7). No guarantee contract becomes effective unless it is made in writing (Factor 10).
Output: (7, 10) | N

Justification: Since the contract does not provide for a maximum amount and there is no information about the contract being made in writing, we cannot determine if the defendant is pledged. The contract may not be effective due to the lack of a written agreement or a specified maximum amount.

These cases cover different combinations of factors, and each output provides a determined verdict based on the provided article and factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual does not become effective unless it provides for the maximum amount in writing or by means of an electronic or magnetic record. 

From the provided factors, we can see:
- A contract for revolving guarantee by an individual does not become effective unless it provides for the maximum amount prescribed (Factor 7).
- No guarantee contract becomes effective unless it is made in writing (Factor 10).
- If a guarantee contract is concluded by electronic or magnetic record which records the terms thereof, the guarantee contract is deemed to be made in writing (Factor 11).

Combining these points, we can logically infer that for a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual to be effective, it must provide for a maximum amount and this provision must be either in writing or through an electronic/magnetic record. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the given factors, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. A guarantor to a guarantee contract for revolving guarantee by an individual is liable to perform the obligation.
➡ The query does not directly entail this factor as it focuses on the effectiveness of the contract rather than the liability of the guarantor.

2. The principal obligation is one or more unidentified obligations within a certain specified scope.
➡ The query does not entail this factor because it discusses the conditions for a contract to be effective, not the nature of the principal obligation.

3. The guarantor is not a corporation in a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual.
➡ The query does not entail this factor as it does not specify or imply anything about the nature (corporate or individual) of the guarantor.

4. The liability of the guarantor includes the amounts of the principal of the principal obligation, any interest, penalty and compensation for loss or damage in connection with the principal obligation, and all other charges secondary to the obligation.
➡ The query does not entail this factor as it is concerned with the contract's effectiveness rather than detailing the extent of the guarantor's liability.

5. The liability of the guarantor also includes the amount of any penalty or compensation for loss or damage which is agreed-upon with regard to the guarantee obligation.
➡ Similar to Factor 4, the query does not entail this factor because it doesn't address the specifics of the guarantor's liability.

6. There is a maximum amount that pertains to all of these amounts for which the guarantor is liable.
➡ The query entails this factor indirectly by mentioning the necessity of providing for a "maximum amount" for the contract to be effective, though it doesn't explicitly state what this maximum amount pertains to.

7. A contract for revolving guarantee by an individual does not become effective unless it provides for the maximum amount prescribed.
➡ The query entails this factor directly as it states the contract must provide for a "maximum amount" to be effective.

8. The provisions of Article 446, paragraphs (2) and (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the provisions concerning a maximum amount in a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual.
➡ The query does not entail this factor since it doesn't reference any external articles or their applications.

9. A guarantor has the responsibility to perform the obligation of the principal obligor when the latter fails to perform that obligation.
➡ The query does not entail this factor as it focuses on contract effectiveness rather than the responsibilities of the guarantor.

10. No guarantee contract becomes effective unless it is made in writing.
➡ The query entails this factor partially by stating the contract must be "in writing or by means of an electronic or magnetic record," aligning with Factor 11's clarification on what constitutes being "in writing."

11. If a guarantee contract is concluded by electronic or magnetic record which records the terms thereof, the guarantee contract is deemed to be made in writing.
➡ The query entails this factor directly as it includes "by means of an electronic or magnetic record" as an acceptable method for the contract to be considered effective.

The justifications provided support the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual becomes effective according to the given factors.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict states that "A guarantor to a guarantee contract for revolving guarantee by an individual is liable to perform the obligation up to a certain maximum amount which pertains to all of the amounts specified." This focuses on the liability of the guarantor in such contracts.

The query's implication regarding the verdict is about the effectiveness of the contract, specifically that it requires a provision for a maximum amount in writing or electronic/magnetic record. While both relate to contracts for revolving guarantee by an individual, they address different aspects: one (the article's verdict) deals with the guarantor's liability, and the other (the query) deals with the contract's effectiveness.

However, considering the subject matter (contracts for revolving guarantee by an individual), it can be inferred that both verdicts indeed apply to the same type of defendant or party involved in such legal agreements. Therefore:

• (verdict Yes) 

The final answer is: $\boxed{True}$

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 law cases with unique combinations of factors. Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** (<3>, <4>, <6> | Y)
The parties did not specify the term of a lease (Factor 3), and either party may give a notice of termination at any time (Factor 4). The lease is for land (relevant to Factor 6), which has a termination period of one year after the day of the notice of termination. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to terminate the lease after one year.

**Case 2:** (<1>, <2> | N)
The parties specified the term of a lease (Factor 1), and one party reserved the right to terminate during that period (Factor 2). According to Article 618, the provisions of the preceding Article apply mutatis mutandis. Since the term is specified, the defendant is not pledged to terminate the lease without considering the reserved right.

**Case 3:** (<5>, <7> | Y)
The type of lease is a factor in determining the termination period (Factor 5), and the lease is for buildings (relevant to Factor 7), which has a termination period of three months after the day of the notice of termination. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to terminate the lease after three months.

**Case 4:** (<9>, <10> | Y)
The lease is for land with harvest seasons (relevant to Factors 9 and 10). The notice of termination must be given after the end of that season and before the next start of cultivation. Assuming this condition is met, the defendant is pledged to terminate the lease according to the specified conditions.

**Case 5:** (<8> | Y)
The lease is for movables and party room (relevant to Factor 8), which has a termination period of one day after the day of the notice of termination. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to terminate the lease after one day.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that A has leased movable X owned by A to B, with a specified term and an agreement that A reserves the right to terminate during the term. According to the provided factors, specifically factor 2 (One party reserves, or both parties reserve, the right to terminate during the specified term) in conjunction with factor 8 (Leases of movables and party room have a termination period of one day after the day of the notice of termination), it suggests that if A gives a notice of termination, the lease can indeed be terminated. However, factor 2 also implies that the reservation of the right to terminate affects how Article 618 applies, potentially altering the standard termination periods stated for different types of leases. The query implies that because A reserved the right to terminate, A may give a notice of termination at any time, which seems plausible under the condition that one party has reserved the right to terminate during the term, as it aligns with the principle behind factor 2 and the verdict statement regarding Article 618.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query appears to be True because it aligns with the principles outlined in the factors regarding termination rights and notice periods for movables.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. The parties specify the term of a lease.
➡ (query entails 1) - The query mentions that "the term of the lease is specified."

2. One party reserves, or both parties reserve, the right to terminate during the specified term.
➡ (query entails 2) - It's stated that "it is agreed that A reserves the right to terminate during the term."

3. The parties do not specify the term of a lease.
- The query does not express this factor because it specifies that the term of the lease is given.

4. Either party may give a notice of termination at any time if the term is not specified.
- The query does not directly express this factor since it discusses a scenario with a specified term and focuses on A's right to terminate.

5. The type of lease is a factor in determining the termination period (e.g., leases of land, buildings, movables, and party room).
➡ (query entails 5) - The query involves a lease of a movable, implying consideration of the type of lease.

6. Leases of land have a termination period of one year after the day of the notice of termination.
- This factor is not directly expressed in the query since it deals with a movable.

7. Leases of buildings have a termination period of three months after the day of the notice of termination.
- Similar to factor 6, this is not expressed as the query concerns a movable.

8. Leases of movables and party room have a termination period of one day after the day of the notice of termination.
➡ (query entails 8) - Although not explicitly stating the termination period, the context implies consideration of movables.

9. For leases of land with harvest seasons, the notice of termination must be given after the end of that season.
- This factor is not expressed as the query does not involve land or harvest seasons.

10. For leases of land with harvest seasons, the notice of termination must be given before the next start of cultivation.
- Similar to factor 9, this is not relevant to the query's scenario involving a movable.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 that the query is True because it accurately reflects principles related to lease terminations based on specified terms and reserved rights for movables.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the context, both the query's scenario and the article's factors seem to address the termination of leases from the perspective of either party involved in a lease agreement (lessor or lessee), without specifying that the rules apply differently based on being the defendant in a legal case. Therefore, it appears they refer to the same general principles regarding lease terminations.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 7 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

1. (<factor 1>, <factor 3> | Y)
Justification: The defendant acknowledged a right, which started a new period of prescription (factor 1). Additionally, the postponement of the expiry of the prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period or to renew prescription period have arisen and their successors (factor 3). Since the defendant acknowledged the right, a new prescription period commenced, and the postponement of the expiry of the prescription period is effective between the parties. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

2. (<factor 2>, <factor 6> | N)
Justification: The acknowledgment of a right does not require unlimited capacity to act or authority with respect to the disposition of the right of the other party (factor 2). However, certain provisions apply mutatis mutandis to circumstances that arise with regard to the guarantor that bears the obligation jointly and severally with the principal obligor (factor 6). Since the acknowledgment does not require unlimited capacity, it does not affect the applicability of the provisions to the guarantor. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

3. (<factor 4>, <factor 7> | Y)
Justification: The postponement of expiry of prescription period under specific provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period have arisen and their successors (factor 4). Any circumstances that have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors are not effective in relation to other joint and several obligors, except in certain prescribed cases (factor 7). Since the postponement is effective between the parties, and the circumstances are not effective in relation to other obligors, the defendant is pledged.

4. (<factor 5>, <factor 8> | N)
Justification: The renewal of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to renew prescription period have arisen and their successors (factor 5). The intention of the obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors can manifest a different intention, which prevails with respect to the effect in relation to the remaining other joint and several obligees (factor 8). Since the renewal is effective between the parties, but the intention of the obligee and another obligor may differ, the defendant is not pledged.

5. (<factor 1>, <factor 6> | Y)
Justification: The defendant acknowledged a right, which started a new period of prescription (factor 1). Certain provisions apply mutatis mutandis to circumstances that arise with regard to the guarantor that bears the obligation jointly and severally with the principal obligor (factor 6). Since the acknowledgment started a new prescription period, and the provisions apply to the guarantor, the defendant is pledged.

6. (<factor 3>, <factor 8> | N)
Justification: The postponement of the expiry of prescription period or the renewal of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period or to renew prescription period have arisen and their successors (factor 3). The intention of the obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors can manifest a different intention, which prevails with respect to the effect in relation to the remaining other joint and several obligees (factor 8). Since the postponement or renewal is effective between the parties, but the intention of the obligee and another obligor may differ, the defendant is not pledged.

7. (<factor 2>, <factor 4> | Y)
Justification: The acknowledgment of a right does not require unlimited capacity to act or authority with respect to the disposition of the right of the other party (factor 2). The postponement of expiry of prescription period under specific provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period have arisen and their successors (factor 4). Since the acknowledgment does not require unlimited capacity, and the postponement is effective between the parties, the defendant is pledged.

Note that each case has a unique combination of factors, and the justification for each case leads to a determined verdict of either "Y" (yes, the defendant is pledged) or "N" (no, the defendant is not pledged).

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 4 law cases that meet the conditions.

**Case 1:**
The obligor sells a property to a beneficiary without disclosing its true value, knowing it will prejudice the obligee's claim. The subject matter is a property right, and the obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act.
Justification: The obligor committed an act with knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee (Factor 2), and the subject matter is a property right (Factor 4). Therefore, the obligee may demand rescission of the fraudulent act.
Output: (1, 2, 4) | Y

**Case 2:**
The obligor donates a property to a beneficiary who knows that the donation will prejudice the obligee's claim. The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.
Justification: Although the beneficiary knows about the prejudice (contradicting Factor 3), and the obligee's claim is enforceable (Factor 6), the act was committed with knowledge of prejudice (Factor 2). However, since the beneficiary knew about the prejudice, this case does not meet all conditions for rescission.
Output: (2, 3, 6) | N

**Case 3:**
The obligor transfers a property to a beneficiary without knowing it will prejudice the obligee. The subject matter is a property right, and the obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act. However, the obligee's claim is not enforceable by compulsory execution.
Justification: Since the obligor did not know about the prejudice (contradicting Factor 2), and the obligee's claim is not enforceable (contradicting Factor 6), despite meeting other conditions (Factors 4 and 5), rescission cannot be demanded.
Output: (1, 4, 5) | N

**Case 4:**
The obligor enters into a contract with a beneficiary that prejudices the obligee's claim. The beneficiary does not know about the prejudice, and the subject matter is a property right. The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act and is enforceable by compulsory execution.
Justification: This case meets all conditions for rescission (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Therefore, the obligee may demand rescission of the fraudulent act.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis into the required steps.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query presents a scenario where A has a claim against B for 20 million yen, and B is insolvent, knowing that each act (such as assigning its claim against E to F) would prejudice the creditor (A). The key point is that the notice of assignment to E was given after A's claim against B had arisen. Given the conditions specified in the article, particularly that the obligor (B) commits an act knowing it will prejudice the obligee (A), and considering the timing of the notice which suggests an attempt to evade creditors, the query seems to align with the conditions under which an obligee may demand the court to rescind an act. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.**
   ➡ (query entails 1) - The query involves A demanding the rescission of B's act (assigning its claim to F after A's claim arose), which B knew would prejudice A.

2. **The act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.**
   ➡ (query entails 2) - B's assignment of its claim to F, done after A's claim arose and with the knowledge that it would prejudice A, fits this condition.

3. **The beneficiary of the act does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.**
   ➡ (query entails 3) - The query implies E (the beneficiary of B's act) was not aware of how the assignment would affect A when it happened, as indicated by the timing of the notice.

4. **The subject matter of the act is a property right.**
   ➡ (query entails 4) - The assignment of B's claim against E to F involves a property right (the claim), which aligns with this factor.

5. **The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act prescribed in paragraph (1).**
   ➡ (query entails 5) - A's claim against B arose from a contract for sale concluded before the notice of assignment was given to E, fitting this condition.

6. **The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.**
   ➡ (query entails 6) - Although not explicitly stated in the query, given that A has a claim based on a contract and B is insolvent, it can be inferred that A would seek legal enforcement of their claim, which could involve compulsory execution.

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is **True**.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information in both the query and the article, it appears that both verdicts refer to situations where an obligee (such as A in the query) can demand the rescission of acts committed by an obligor (B in the query) that are known to prejudice the obligee. The focus is on protecting the rights of the obligee against actions taken by the obligor with knowledge of the prejudice such actions would cause.

• **(verdict Yes)** - Both the query's verdict and the article's verdict apply to the same type of defendant, namely an obligor who commits acts knowing they will prejudice the obligee.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 97, I will generate 4 law cases with unique combinations of factors. Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, a manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party (Factor 1), but the other party prevents notice of a manifestation of intention from reaching them without a legitimate reason (Factor 2). According to Article 97(2), the notice is deemed to have reached that party at the time it would have normally reached them. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 2:** (4 | N)
In this case, the person making a manifestation of intention dies after having sent the notice (Factor 4). However, according to Article 97(3), the effect of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it dies after having sent the notice. Since there are no other factors preventing the notice from reaching the other party, the defendant is not pledged solely based on this factor.

**Case 3:** (1, 5 | Y)
In this case, a manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party (Factor 1), and the person making a manifestation of intention loses mental capacity after having sent the notice (Factor 5). According to Article 97(3), the effect of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it loses mental capacity after having sent the notice. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 4:** (2, 6 | Y)
In this case, the other party prevents notice of a manifestation of intention from reaching them without a legitimate reason (Factor 2), and the person making a manifestation of intention becomes subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after having sent the notice (Factor 6). According to Article 97(2) and (3), the notice is deemed to have reached that party at the time it would have normally reached them, and the effect of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it becomes subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after having sent the notice. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

Note: The output format follows the requested format, with the factor numbers in parentheses, separated by commas, followed by the verdict (Y or N).

	•	(verdict No) if they do not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Determine the truth value of the query based on logical reasoning
The query states that even if it is a contract offer with a determined consent period, if the period is before or at the same time as the arrival of the offer, it can be revoked. This statement seems to contradict the principle outlined in Article 97, which suggests that once a manifestation of intention is sent, its effect is not impaired by events such as the sender's death, loss of mental capacity, or restrictions on their legal capacity to act after sending the notice. However, the query specifically talks about revocation during a consent period that ends before or at the same time as the offer arrives, which aligns with general principles allowing for revocation of offers before acceptance.

## Step 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor
1. A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party.
➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - The query discusses revocation during a specific period, not when a manifestation becomes effective.

2. The other party prevents notice of a manifestation of intention from reaching them without a legitimate reason.
➡ (query does not entail this factor) - There's no mention of prevention by the other party in the query.

3. Notice is prevented from reaching the other party without a legitimate reason.
➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query focuses on the timing of consent periods and revocation, not on the prevention of notice.

4. The person making a manifestation of intention dies after having sent the notice.
➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query does not consider the death of the person making the manifestation.

5. The person making a manifestation of intention loses mental capacity after having sent the notice.
➡ (query does not entail this factor) - Similar to factor 4, the query does not address loss of mental capacity.

6. The person making a manifestation of intention becomes subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after having sent the notice.
➡ (query does not entail this factor) - Again, the query does not consider changes in legal capacity to act.

## Step 3: Determine if the justifications align with the result from Task 1
Based on Task 2, it's clear that the query does not directly address the factors outlined in Article 97. However, the query's focus on revocation during a specific consent period suggests it operates within a different aspect of contract law, potentially aligned with principles that allow for offer revocation under certain conditions.

## Step 4: Determine if the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant
Given that Article 97 discusses the effectiveness and irrevocability of a manifestation of intention once sent (under specific conditions), and the query talks about revoking an offer during its consent period, these seem to address different scenarios within contract law. The article focuses on the protection of the recipient's expectations once a manifestation is sent, while the query considers the sender's ability to revoke an offer before it is accepted or before the consent period ends.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors described in Article 598, I will generate 4 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors.

**Case 1:** 
The case is prescribed in paragraph (2) of the preceding Article and a period that is sufficient for the borrower to use and make profit from the borrowed thing has passed. 
(1, 2 | Y)

Justification: Since the case meets the conditions outlined in paragraph (2) of the preceding Article and a sufficient period has passed for the borrower to use and make profit from the borrowed thing, the lender may cancel the contract according to Article 598(1). Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 2:** 
The parties do not specify a period of a loan for use or a purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing.
(3, 4 | Y)

Justification: According to Article 598(2), if the parties do not specify these details, the lender may cancel the contract at any time. Thus, the defendant is pledged as they can indeed cancel the contract under these conditions.

**Case 3:** 
The borrower wishes to cancel the contract.
(6 | Y)

Justification: Article 598(3) clearly states that the borrower may cancel the contract at any time. Therefore, if the borrower chooses to do so, they are within their rights as per the article, and thus the defendant is pledged.

**Case 4:** 
The case is not prescribed in paragraph (2) of the preceding Article but the lender wants to cancel the contract after a certain period.
(5 | N)

Justification: Since this scenario does not meet the initial condition specified in Article 598(1), which requires the case to be as prescribed in paragraph (2) of the preceding Article, the article's provisions regarding cancellation after a sufficient period do not apply directly. The lender's ability to cancel is contingent upon meeting specific criteria outlined in the article, and without those conditions being met, they cannot unilaterally decide to cancel based on their own determination of "a certain period." Therefore, the defendant is not pledged under these circumstances.

These cases provide a variety of scenarios where different combinations of factors from Article 598 are considered, leading to determined verdicts based on the article's stipulations.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined, let's break down the information provided.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if the parties have not specified the timing of the return and the purposes of using and taking profits, the lender may not demand the return of the subject matter of the loan for use unless the lender demands the return, specifying a reasonable period. This aligns with principles found in contracts law where specificity regarding terms such as duration or purpose can significantly affect the rights of parties involved, especially in cases where such specifics are omitted.

Given Article 598's breakdown:
- The lender has specific conditions under which they may cancel the contract (after a sufficient period for use has passed or at any time if no terms are specified).
- The borrower has the right to cancel at any time.

However, the critical aspect here is whether the lender can demand return without prior specification of timing and purpose. Generally, in legal contexts, specificity regarding such contractual elements is crucial for enforcing obligations like return demands. Without specific terms, lenders might indeed face limitations on demanding immediate return, as this could unfairly restrict borrowers who were not given clear expectations.

Therefore, logically reasoning through the provided information suggests that the query aligns with principles of contract law where specificity in agreements affects party rights. Hence, considering typical legal standards for contracts and loan agreements, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The case is prescribed in paragraph (2) of the preceding Article.**
   ➡ The query does not directly mention or imply a reference to a preceding article or its paragraphs, so it doesn't express this factor.

2. **A period that is sufficient for the borrower to use and make profit from the borrowed thing has passed, in line with the purpose referred to in the preceding Article's paragraph (2).**
   ➡ The query implies consideration of time ("unless the lender demands the return, specifying a reasonable period") but doesn't directly express this factor as it discusses demanding return rather than the passage of sufficient time for use.

3. **The parties do not specify a period of a loan for use.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) The query explicitly mentions a scenario where "the parties have not specified the timing of the return," aligning with this condition.

4. **The parties do not specify a purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) Similar to factor 3, the query mentions scenarios where purposes are unspecified ("purposes of the using and taking profits"), directly expressing this condition.

5. **The lender may cancel the contract upon the passage of a sufficient period as described, or at any time if no period or purpose is specified.**
   ➡ The query touches on conditions under which a lender can demand return (specifying a reasonable period) but does not express the lender's ability to cancel the contract based on these terms.

6. **The borrower may cancel the contract at any time.**
   ➡ The query does not mention the borrower's right to cancel the contract, focusing instead on the lender's rights regarding demanding return.

Justifications align with the logical reasoning provided in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is true based on typical contractual principles.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The article's verdict discusses conditions under which a lender may cancel a contract or demand return, focusing on the lender's rights.
- The query's verdict also pertains to the lender's ability to demand return under certain conditions (lack of specified timing and purpose).

Both the article's verdict and the query's verdict primarily concern the **lender's** actions and rights in the context of a loan for use agreement. Thus, they refer to the same defendant, which is the lender in this scenario.

 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Here are the cases:

**Case 1:**

In this case, we assume that "Gifts become effective by the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property to the other party gratuitously" (Factor 1) and "The acceptance of the other party is required for gifts to become effective" (Factor 2) have occurred. Since both conditions for a gift to be effective are met, the defendant is pledged to fulfill the gift obligation. Verdict: **Yes**

**Case 2:** 
(3 | N)
In this case, we assume that only "With respect to gifts that become effective on the death of the donor, the provisions regarding bequests apply mutatis mutandis" (Factor 3) has occurred. However, without considering whether these provisions are inconsistent with the nature of such gifts (Factor 4), we cannot conclude that the defendant is pledged. Verdict: **No**

**Case 3:** 
(1, 3 | N)
In this case, we assume that "Gifts become effective by the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property to the other party gratuitously" (Factor 1) and "With respect to gifts that become effective on the death of the donor, the provisions regarding bequests apply mutatis mutandis" (Factor 3) have occurred. Although there is an intention to give, without acceptance by the other party (Factor 2), the gift is not effective. Verdict: **No**

**Case 4:** 
(2, 4 | Y)
In this case, we assume that "The acceptance of the other party is required for gifts to become effective" (Factor 2) has occurred and "The application of provisions regarding bequests to gifts that become effective on the death of the donor is limited to the extent they are not inconsistent with the nature of gifts that become effective on the death of the donor" (Factor 4) is considered. Given that there's an acceptance and a consideration of consistency with the gift's nature, we can infer an effective gift obligation under specific conditions related to bequests, thus pledging the defendant.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that gifts on the donor's death do not need to be made in writing but can be concluded only by agreement of the parties. The articles mention that gifts become effective by the manifestation of intention to give a certain property gratuitously and require acceptance by the other party. For gifts that become effective on the death of the donor, provisions regarding bequests apply mutatis mutandis, with limitations where they are inconsistent with the nature of such gifts.

Given this information:
- The requirement for writing is not explicitly mentioned in the provided factors for gifts becoming effective.
- The manifestation of intention and acceptance are key for a gift to become effective.
- Provisions regarding bequests (which typically require a written will) apply to gifts on death, but with limitations.

Since the articles do not explicitly state that gifts on the donor's death must be in writing or cannot be made without writing, and they emphasize agreement (manifestation of intention and acceptance), it could be inferred that such gifts can indeed be concluded by agreement. However, the application of bequest provisions suggests some formality might be implied for gifts effective upon death, but this does not directly contradict the query's statement about not needing to be in writing.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and without explicit contradiction from the provided articles, the query could be considered **True**, albeit with nuances regarding the application of bequest provisions.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Gifts become effective by the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property to the other party gratuitously.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it discusses gifts in the context of an agreement, implying a manifestation of intention.

2. **The acceptance of the other party is required for gifts to become effective.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as it mentions that gifts can be concluded only by agreement of the parties, which includes acceptance.

3. **With respect to gifts that become effective on the death of the donor, the provisions regarding bequests apply mutatis mutandis.**
   ➡ The query does not directly address the application of bequest provisions but focuses on the method of concluding such gifts (by agreement). It doesn't explicitly contradict this factor but doesn't directly entail it either.

4. **The application of provisions regarding bequests to gifts that become effective on the death of the donor is limited to the extent they are not inconsistent with the nature of gifts that become effective on the death of the donor.**
   ➡ Similar to factor 3, the query does not directly address the limitations of applying bequest provisions to such gifts.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 in that the query seems to focus on the basic requirements for gifts (intention and acceptance) rather than the specific legal formalities or provisions applicable to gifts upon death. The nuances regarding bequest provisions suggest a complexity not fully addressed by the query.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The article's verdict is about applying provisions regarding bequests to gifts that become effective on the death of the donor, to the extent they are not inconsistent with the nature of such gifts.
- The query's focus is on whether gifts on the donor's death need to be in writing or can be concluded by agreement.

Both the query and the article discuss scenarios involving gifts that become effective upon the donor's death. Therefore, they refer to the same general scenario or defendant (in a broad sense, the legal subject of gifts upon death), but they address different aspects of these gifts.

• (verdict Yes) They do refer to the same defendant in the context of gifts becoming effective on the donor's death, though they explore different facets of such transactions.

1. A manager has incurred beneficial expenses for a principal.
2. The manager may claim reimbursement of those costs from the principal.
3. A manager has incurred beneficial obligations on behalf of the principal.
4. The provisions of Article 650, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis in cases where a manager has incurred beneficial obligations.
5. A manager has engaged in benevolent intervention in another's business against the will of the principal.
6. The provisions of the preceding paragraphs apply mutatis mutandis to the extent currently enriched in cases of benevolent intervention.
7. A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing.
8. The claim of the possessor has fallen due.
9. Possession commenced by means of a tortious act.

Verdict: If a manager has incurred beneficial expenses for a principal, the manager may claim reimbursement of those costs from the principal; if a possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing, that possessor may retain that thing until that claim is satisfied.

======== Generate Examples:
 I will generate 5 law cases based on the provided factors.

**Case 1:**
Assuming factors 1 and 7 have happened. A manager has incurred beneficial expenses for a principal (factor 1), and a possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing (factor 7). In this case, the manager may claim reimbursement of those costs from the principal, and the possessor may retain the thing until their claim is satisfied. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

Output: (1, 7) | Y

**Case 2:**
Assuming factors 3 and 8 have happened. A manager has incurred beneficial obligations on behalf of the principal (factor 3), and the claim of the possessor has fallen due (factor 8). In this case, the provisions of Article 650, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis, and the possessor may retain the thing until their claim is satisfied. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

Output: (3, 8) | Y

**Case 3:**
Assuming factors 5 and 9 have happened. A manager has engaged in benevolent intervention in another's business against the will of the principal (factor 5), and possession commenced by means of a tortious act (factor 9). In this case, the provisions of the preceding paragraphs do not apply to the extent currently enriched, and the possessor may not retain the thing. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

Output: (5, 9) | N

**Case 4:**
Assuming factors 2 and 6 have happened. The manager may claim reimbursement of those costs from the principal (factor 2), and the provisions of the preceding paragraphs apply mutatis mutandis to the extent currently enriched in cases of benevolent intervention (factor 6). In this case, the manager may claim reimbursement, but only to the extent currently enriched. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

Output: (2, 6) | Y

**Case 5:**
Assuming factor 4 has happened. The provisions of Article 650, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis in cases where a manager has incurred beneficial obligations (factor 4). In this case, there is no direct claim or reimbursement mentioned, so the defendant is not pledged.

Output: (4) | N

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query describes a scenario where A finds an injured dog, takes care of it (including paying for veterinary fees), and then refuses to return the dog to its owner until reimbursed for the expenses incurred. The key principle here revolves around the concept of reimbursement for beneficial expenses incurred by someone (in this case, A) on behalf of another (the dog's owner).

Given the information from the articles, a manager who incurs beneficial expenses for a principal may claim reimbursement of those costs from the principal. Similarly, a possessor of a thing belonging to another person can retain that thing until any claim arising in relation to it is satisfied.

Applying this logic to A's situation, since A has incurred beneficial expenses (veterinary fees) on behalf of the dog's owner and is now seeking reimbursement before returning the dog, the query aligns with the principles outlined in the articles. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. A manager has incurred beneficial expenses for a principal.
➡ (query entails this factor) - Although the query involves a finder of a dog rather than a traditional manager-principal relationship, the principle of incurring beneficial expenses applies.

2. The manager may claim reimbursement of those costs from the principal.
➡ (query entails this factor) - A is essentially claiming reimbursement for the veterinary fees from the dog's owner before returning the dog.

3. A manager has incurred beneficial obligations on behalf of the principal.
➡ (query entails this factor) - By taking care of the injured dog and paying for its treatment, A has incurred beneficial obligations on behalf of the unknown owner.

4. The provisions of Article 650, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis in cases where a manager has incurred beneficial obligations.
➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - While the query involves beneficial actions (taking care of the dog), it doesn't explicitly mention the application of specific article provisions.

5. A manager has engaged in benevolent intervention in another's business against the will of the principal.
➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The scenario describes A's actions as being for the benefit of the dog and, by extension, its owner, without any indication that these actions were against the owner's will.

6. The provisions of the preceding paragraphs apply mutatis mutandis to the extent currently enriched in cases of benevolent intervention.
➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - Similar to factor 4, the query doesn't explicitly address the application of provisions related to benevolent intervention.

7. A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing.
➡ (query entails this factor) - A, as the possessor of the dog, has a claim (reimbursement for veterinary fees) related to the dog.

8. The claim of the possessor has fallen due.
➡ (query entails this factor) - The query implies that the claim (for reimbursement) is due since A is seeking payment before returning the dog.

9. Possession commenced by means of a tortious act.
➡ (query does not entail this factor) - There's no indication in the scenario that A's possession of the dog began through a tortious (wrongful or illegal) act; instead, it started with finding an injured dog and acting benevolently.

The justifications for these factors support the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is **True**, as it aligns with principles related to reimbursement for beneficial expenses and the rights of possessors.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario and the article's principles deal with individuals (or entities) who have incurred expenses or obligations on behalf of others and are seeking reimbursement, we can conclude that:
• **(verdict Yes)** - The verdicts refer to the same type of defendant, namely, someone who has acted on behalf of another and is now seeking compensation for their actions.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 4 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors.

**Case 1:**
A first party asks a second party to perform a juridical act, but the second party does not accept. 
(1, 4 | N) 

Justification: Since the second party did not accept, the mandate is not effective according to Article 643, which requires acceptance by the second party.

**Case 2:**
A first party asks a second party with performing a juridical act, and the second party accepts. 
(1, 2, 4 | Y) 

Justification: This case meets all the necessary conditions for a mandate to become effective according to Article 643. The first party requested the second party, the request involves performing a juridical act, and the second party accepted.

**Case 3:**
A second party accepts to perform a juridical act without being asked by a first party.
(2, 5 | N) 

Justification: Although the second party accepted and the action involves a juridical act, there was no request from a first party. According to Article 643, a mandate becomes effective when a first party asks a second party, which is not present in this case.

**Case 4:**
The provisions of this Section apply mutatis mutandis to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts, and a first party asks a second party.
(3, 6 | N) 

Justification: While the provisions can be applied to other types of business entrustments with necessary modifications (mutatis mutandis), the request by the first party alone is insufficient for the mandate to become effective. The nature of the action (juridical or not) and acceptance by the second party are also critical factors that are not met in this scenario.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "A quasi-mandate shall be effective even if it is not made in writing but a mandate shall not be effective unless it is made in writing."

From the information given, we understand that for a mandate to become effective, there must be a request from one party to another involving a juridical act, and this must be accepted by the second party. However, the query introduces a distinction between mandates and quasi-mandates regarding their effectiveness in relation to being made in writing.

Without explicit information on quasi-mandates in the provided factors, we can only infer based on general principles. Typically, legal documents or agreements that require writing to be effective are those where the law specifies such a requirement for validity (e.g., contracts for the sale of real estate). If a quasi-mandate does not require written form to be effective, this suggests it operates under different rules than a standard mandate.

Given the information and logical reasoning:
- The statement about quasi-mandates being effective without written form may be true based on the principle that not all legal agreements or mandates require written documentation to be valid.
- The statement about mandates requiring written form to be effective could also be considered plausible under specific legal frameworks where such a requirement is stipulated for validity.

However, without explicit articles or factors detailing these requirements, we must consider general legal principles. Thus, based on logical reasoning and typical legal distinctions between types of mandates and agreements, the query's assertions about quasi-mandates and mandates could be seen as potentially true, depending on the specific legal context or jurisdiction in question.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A mandate becomes effective when a first party asks a second party with performing a juridical act:** 
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - The query discusses the form (written vs. not written) of mandates and quasi-mandates but does not address the initiation or the nature of the act itself.

2. **The second party accepts this:**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - Acceptance by the second party is crucial for a mandate's effectiveness, but the query focuses on the written requirement rather than the process of acceptance.

3. **The provisions of this Section apply mutatis mutandis to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts:**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query does not mention anything about applying provisions to other types of business entrustments or the concept of mutatis mutandis.

4. **A first party asks a second party:**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - While it mentions mandates and quasi-mandates, it doesn't explicitly discuss the interaction between parties in terms of requests.

5. **Performing a juridical act:**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query's focus is on the formality of the mandate rather than the nature of the act itself.

6. **The second party accepts:**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - As mentioned, acceptance is not discussed in the query.

Justification for these assessments aligns with understanding that the query introduces a new aspect (the requirement for written form) not directly addressed by the factors provided.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information, the article's verdict discusses the conditions under which a mandate becomes effective (request, juridical act, acceptance), while the query's verdict distinguishes between mandates and quasi-mandates based on written requirements. 

Without explicit mention of defendants or parties in the query that directly correlate with those implied in the factors, we can only consider the subject matter: mandates and quasi-mandates.

• (verdict No) - The query and article's verdicts seem to address different aspects of mandates (effectiveness conditions vs. written requirements), suggesting they might apply to different scenarios or defendants within a legal context, although both deal with mandates in general terms.

**Case 1:** 
The subject of contribution is monies and a partner fails to make the contribution. However, there is no evidence that the partner who failed to contribute must pay interest on the same or compensate for loss or damage.
Output: (1, 2 | N)

Justification: Although two factors are present, the verdict requires that the partner pays interest and compensates for loss or damage, which is not mentioned in this case. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 2:** 
The subject of contribution is monies and the partner who failed to contribute must pay interest on the same.
Output: (1, 3 | N)

Justification: Only two factors are present, but the verdict requires that the partner also compensates for loss or damage. Since this factor is missing, the defendant is not fully pledged.

**Case 3:** 
A partner fails to make the contribution and the partner who failed to contribute must pay interest on the same and otherwise compensate for loss or damage.
Output: (2, 3, 4 | Y)

Justification: Although the subject of contribution is not explicitly stated as monies, the other three factors are present. The defendant's failure to contribute and obligation to pay interest and compensate for loss or damage align with the verdict. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 4:** 
The subject of contribution is monies and the partner who failed to contribute must otherwise compensate for loss or damage.
Output: (1, 4 | N)

Justification: Only two factors are present, but the verdict requires that the partner fails to make the contribution and pays interest on the same. Since these factors are missing, the defendant is not pledged.

Note that each case has a unique combination of factors, and the output is either Y (Yes) or N (No), indicating whether the defendant is pledged according to the verdict.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "If monies are the subject of contribution, a partner who fails to make the contribution must pay interest on the same and otherwise compensate for loss or damage."

Given the breakdown from Article 669:
- The subject of contribution is indeed monies.
- A partner who fails to contribute is required to pay interest and otherwise compensate for any loss or damage.

Based on this, the query accurately reflects the conditions and consequences outlined in Article 669. Therefore, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The subject of contribution is monies**: 
➡ (query entails The subject of contribution is monies)  
   The query explicitly mentions that "monies are the subject of contribution," directly addressing this factor.

2. **A partner fails to make the contribution**: 
➡ (query entails A partner fails to make the contribution)  
   The query states "a partner who fails to make the contribution," which aligns with this condition.

3. **The partner who failed to contribute must pay interest on the same (monies)**: 
➡ (query entails The partner who failed to contribute must pay interest on the same)  
   This is directly mentioned in the query as "must pay interest on the same."

4. **The partner who failed to contribute must otherwise compensate for loss or damage**: 
➡ (query entails The partner who failed to contribute must otherwise compensate for loss or damage)  
   The query also includes "and otherwise compensate for loss or damage," covering this aspect.

All factors are entailed by the query, which supports the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict states: "That partner must pay interest on the same and otherwise compensate for loss or damage."

The query's verdict essentially mirrors this, stating a partner who fails to contribute must pay interest and compensate for losses.

Given that both the article and the query are discussing the obligations of "a partner" who has failed to make a contribution when the subject is monies, it's clear they refer to the same type of defendant. Therefore:
• (verdict Yes)  
The verdicts from both the query and Article 669 apply to the same defendant, a partner who fails to contribute monies as required.

 After carefully reading Article 295, I have broken down the text into key factors and identified the verdict sentence. Here is the result:

* A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing.
* The claim must have arisen in relation to the thing being possessed.
* The possessor may retain the thing until the claim is satisfied, implying that the claim must be valid and related to the thing.
* The relevant claim must have fallen due, meaning it is not pending or conditional.
* Possession of the thing commenced by means of a tortious act is an exception to the general rule.

Verdict: If the conditions are met, the possessor may retain the thing until the claim is satisfied; however, if possession commenced by means of a tortious act, the provisions do not apply.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 295, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the number of factors). Each case will assume a different combination of factors and provide a justified verdict.

**Case 1:**
Assuming factors:
* A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing. (Factor 1)
* The claim must have arisen in relation to the thing being possessed. (Factor 2)
* The relevant claim has fallen due. (Part of Factor 4)

Justification: Since the possessor has a valid claim related to the thing and the claim has fallen due, they may retain the thing until the claim is satisfied.

Output: (1, 2, 4) | Y

**Case 2:**
Assuming factors:
* Possession of the thing commenced by means of a tortious act. (Factor 5)

Justification: Since possession commenced through a tortious act, the provisions of Article 295 do not apply, and the possessor may not retain the thing.

Output: (5) | N

**Case 3:**
Assuming factors:
* A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing. (Factor 1)
* The relevant claim has not yet fallen due. (Part of Factor 4)

Justification: Although the possessor has a valid claim related to the thing, the claim has not yet fallen due. According to Article 295, this exception applies, and the possessor may not retain the thing.

Output: (1, 4) | N

**Case 4:**
Assuming factors:
* The possessor may retain the thing until the claim is satisfied. (Part of Factor 3)
* Possession commenced lawfully (implied by the absence of Factor 5)

Justification: Since possession was lawful and the possessor has a valid claim related to the thing, they may retain the thing until the claim is satisfied.

Output: (3) | Y

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis into the required steps:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query discusses a scenario where a mortgagor did not fulfill their obligations until the time of performance, and the mortgagee transfers the mortgaged properties to a third party. It concludes that the mortgagor may not assert a right of retention against the mortgagee when the third party claims delivery of the properties.

Given the principles outlined in Article 295, which generally allow a possessor to retain a thing until their claim is satisfied if the claim arose in relation to the thing and has fallen due, the query's scenario introduces a complication with the involvement of a third party and the nature of the mortgagee's and mortgagor's obligations.

However, based on logical reasoning, if the mortgagor's obligation was not fulfilled until the time of performance, it suggests that any claim they might have against the mortgagee would be contingent upon their own fulfillment of obligations. If the mortgagee has transferred the properties to a third party, the mortgagor's right of retention would indeed be complicated, as their claim would not directly apply to the new owner (the third party) who is claiming delivery of the properties.

Therefore, considering the principles of possession, claims, and obligations, the query seems to align with logical reasoning regarding rights of retention in complex scenarios involving multiple parties and conditional obligations. Thus, the query can be considered **True** based on the provided information and logical analysis.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it involves a mortgagor (possessor) who has a claim related to the mortgaged properties (thing belonging to another).

2. **The claim must have arisen in relation to the thing being possessed.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as the mortgagor's claim against the mortgagee is directly related to the mortgaged properties.

3. **The possessor may retain the thing until the claim is satisfied, implying that the claim must be valid and related to the thing.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) but with a complication due to the third party's involvement, which affects the direct application of this principle.

4. **The relevant claim must have fallen due, meaning it is not pending or conditional.**
   ➡ (query entails consideration of this factor) because the scenario implies that obligations were to be fulfilled at a specific time, suggesting claims would be considered once those conditions are met.

5. **Possession of the thing commenced by means of a tortious act is an exception to the general rule.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) since there's no mention of the possession being commenced through a tortious act; it discusses a mortgage scenario, which is a contractual agreement.

Justifications provided align with the logical reasoning in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is **True** under the given conditions and analysis.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the article's verdict allows a possessor to retain a thing until their claim is satisfied unless possession commenced by a tortious act, and the query concludes that a mortgagor may not assert a right of retention in a specific scenario involving a third party, we can see these verdicts apply to different aspects of legal rights and obligations.

However, both ultimately concern the rights of possessors (in this case, mortgagors) under certain conditions. Therefore, while the scenarios differ, the subject matter (rights of retention by possessors) is related.

But considering the direct application and the specific scenario presented in the query, which involves additional complexities not directly addressed by the article's general rule (such as the involvement of a third party), it can be argued that:

• **(verdict No)** if we strictly interpret "same defendant" to mean the exact legal entity or individual under the same conditions. The article discusses possessors generally, while the query specifies mortgagors in a particular contractual and transfer scenario.

This conclusion reflects an understanding that while both verdicts pertain to possessory rights, they are applied in distinct contexts, one more general (Article 295) and the other specific (the query's scenario involving mortgage agreements and third-party transfers).

**Case 1:** 
The holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained. The court may grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement of expenses at the request of the owner.
Output: (2, 5) | Y

Justification: Since the holder incurred necessary expenses and the court may grant a reasonable period for reimbursement, the defendant is pledged to reimburse the owner.

**Case 2:** 
There is currently an increase in value as a result of the beneficial expenses incurred by the holder of a right of retention. The provisions of Articles 296 through 300 and those of Article 304 apply mutatis mutandis to pledges.
Output: (4, 1) | Y

Justification: Given the increase in value due to beneficial expenses and the applicability of relevant articles to pledges, the defendant is pledged to reimburse the owner for the increase in value or the expenses.

**Case 3:** 
The holder of a right of retention incurs beneficial expenses with respect to the thing retained.
Output: (3) | N

Justification: Although the holder incurred beneficial expenses, without evidence of an increase in value or other factors, it's unclear whether the defendant is pledged. Therefore, this case does not meet the criteria for a pledge.

**Case 4:** 
The provisions of Articles 296 through 300 and those of Article 304 apply mutatis mutandis to pledges. The holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained.
Output: (1, 2) | Y

Justification: Since the relevant articles apply to pledges and the holder incurred necessary expenses, the defendant is pledged to reimburse the owner for those necessary expenses.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that even if a pledgee of movables paid necessary expenses for the thing pledged, the pledgee may not demand reimbursement for the necessary expenses to the possessor. 

Given the context provided by the factors, particularly factor 2 ("The holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained.") and the verdict ("The holder of a right of retention may have the owner reimburse necessary expenses..."), it suggests that the holder of a right of retention (which could include a pledgee in certain contexts) can indeed demand reimbursement for necessary expenses from the owner. 

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided, the query appears to be False.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The provisions of Articles 296 through 300 and those of Article 304 apply mutatis mutandis to pledges.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query specifically discusses the reimbursement of expenses by a pledgee, without referencing the application of specific articles to pledges.

2. **The holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query mentions a pledgee paying necessary expenses for the thing pledged, which aligns with the concept of incurring necessary expenses.

3. **The holder of a right of retention incurs beneficial expenses with respect to the thing retained.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query only discusses necessary expenses, without mentioning beneficial expenses.

4. **There is currently an increase in value as a result of the beneficial expenses incurred by the holder of a right of retention.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - Similar to factor 3, the query does not address increases in value due to beneficial expenses.

5. **The court may grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement of expenses or increase in value at the request of the owner.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query focuses on the pledgee's ability to demand reimbursement and does not mention court intervention or the owner's request for a repayment schedule.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, indicating that the query is largely about the reimbursement of expenses by a pledgee, which contradicts the general principle outlined in the verdict regarding the holder of a right of retention.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The article's verdict refers to "the holder of a right of retention," who may have the owner reimburse expenses.
- The query's verdict refers to "a pledgee of movables," who, according to the query, may not demand reimbursement for necessary expenses.

While both scenarios involve someone holding or having an interest in property (movables), the specific roles and rights might differ. However, in legal contexts, a pledgee can be considered a type of holder of a right of retention because they retain possession of the pledged item until the debt is paid. 

Despite this overlap, the query's conclusion about reimbursement contradicts the general principle stated in the article's verdict. Thus, considering the specific context and outcome:
• (verdict No) - They do not apply to the same defendant in terms of the legal outcome or right to reimbursement as described.

Justification: Since one of the conditions for recovering the deposited thing is met (the obligee does not accept the deposit), and there's no mention of a judgment becoming final and binding, it can be argued that the performer may recover the deposited thing, thus implying no deposit has been effected.
Output: (1) | Y

**Case 2:** 
The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective becomes final and binding. The performer attempts to recover the deposited thing.
Justification: Since the judgment has become final and binding, this condition overrides the potential for recovery based on non-acceptance or non-final judgment, suggesting the deposit has indeed been effected.
Output: (2) | N

**Case 3:** 
Both factors are present: The obligee does not accept the deposit, and the judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding. The performer seeks to recover the deposited thing.
Justification: Given both conditions for recovery are met (non-acceptance by the obligee and non-final judgment), it strongly supports the case for the performer recovering the deposited thing, thereby deeming no deposit has been effected.
Output: (1, 2) | Y

**Case 4:** 
Neither of the specified factors is present: The obligee accepts the deposit, and the judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective becomes final and binding. The performer still tries to recover the deposited thing.
Justification: Since neither condition for potential recovery (non-acceptance or non-final judgment) applies, the performer's attempt to recover the deposited thing would not align with the conditions under which no deposit is deemed to have been effected.
Output: () | N

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "If a performer lawfully deposits the subject matter of the performance with an official depository, the performer may not recover the deposited thing."

From the information given in Article 496 (1), one of the factors listed is: "The performer may recover the deposited thing." This directly contradicts the query. The article implies that under certain conditions (when the obligee does not accept the deposit and the judgment regarding the effectiveness of the deposit does not become final and binding), the performer can indeed recover the deposited thing. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided from Article 496 (1), the query is False.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

Given factors:
1. The obligee does not accept the deposit
2. The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding
3. The performer may recover the deposited thing

Analysis of each factor in relation to the query:

1. **The obligee does not accept the deposit**: The query does not directly mention the scenario where the obligee's acceptance or lack thereof affects the recovery of the deposited thing. Thus, it does not consider evidence within a similar situation as this factor.
   ➡ (query does not entail "The obligee does not accept the deposit")

2. **The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding**: The query does not address the status of judgments regarding the deposit's effectiveness or their impact on recovering the deposited thing. Therefore, it does not express this factor.
   ➡ (query does not entail "The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding")

3. **The performer may recover the deposited thing**: The query directly contradicts this factor by stating the performer may not recover the deposited thing after a lawful deposit with an official depository.
   ➡ (query entails the negation of "The performer may recover the deposited thing", but for simplicity, we can say it does not align with the given factor as stated)

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 that the query is False because it contradicts at least one condition under which a deposit is considered effective or not.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict states: "In such case, it is deemed that no deposit has been effected." This applies to scenarios where specific conditions are met (e.g., obligee does not accept the deposit, judgment on deposit effectiveness does not become final).

The query implies a scenario where a performer deposits something lawfully but may not recover it. The verdicts seem to address different aspects of deposit cases. However, both essentially concern the performer's rights or obligations in relation to a deposit.

Given this context:
• (verdict No) if we strictly interpret "same defendant" as referring to identical legal circumstances or outcomes.
However, considering the broader interpretation that both verdicts pertain to performers in deposit scenarios, one might argue they refer to similar defendants (performers), but under different conditions or with different outcomes.

For clarity and based on the instructions provided:
• (verdict No)

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 129, I will generate 3 law cases (X = 3), each with a unique combination of factors. For each case, I will justify whether the defendant is pledged and provide a formal output.

**Case 1:**
Assuming factors 1, 2, and 5 occurred:
The condition in question is uncertain regarding its fulfillment (factor 1). The rights of the party concerned may be disposed of while the condition's outcome is uncertain (factor 2). A security may be provided for the rights and obligations of the party concerned while the condition's fulfillment is uncertain (factor 5).
Justification: Given that a security has been provided, it indicates that there are measures in place to protect the interests of the parties involved. Therefore, considering the uncertainty of the condition and the disposition of rights, the defendant can be seen as having taken steps to mitigate risks but still might be pledged due to the ongoing uncertainty.
Formal output: (1, 2, 5 | Y)

**Case 2:**
Assuming factors 3 and 4 occurred:
The obligations of the party concerned may be disposed of while the condition's outcome is uncertain (factor 3). Disposition, inheritance, or preservation of the party's rights and obligations can occur in accordance with general provisions during the uncertainty (factor 4).
Justification: Since the disposition of obligations and the handling of rights and obligations are managed according to general provisions, this suggests a structured approach to dealing with the uncertainty. However, without specific measures like security provision mentioned, it might seem less direct in terms of pledge. Yet, considering the management of obligations, there's an implication of responsibility being taken.
Formal output: (3, 4 | Y)

**Case 3:**
Assuming factor 1 occurred:
The condition in question is uncertain regarding its fulfillment (factor 1).
Justification: With only the uncertainty of the condition's fulfillment considered and no actions taken regarding rights, obligations, or securities, it's less clear whether the defendant has made any commitments or arrangements that would classify them as pledged.
Formal output: (1 | N)

These cases illustrate different scenarios based on the factors provided from Article 129, with justifications for whether the defendants can be considered pledged in each situation.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the information from Article 129 and the breakdown into key phrases and sentences, it appears that both the article and the query discuss the disposition, inheritance, preservation of rights and obligations, and the provision of security during the uncertainty of a condition's fulfillment. The query essentially rephrases the content of the article in slightly different wording but conveys the same meaning regarding the treatment of rights and obligations while a condition's outcome is uncertain.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the query accurately reflects the principles outlined in Article 129. Therefore, logically reasoning through the provided information suggests that the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The condition in question is uncertain regarding its fulfillment.**
   ➡ (query entails the uncertainty of a condition's fulfillment)  
   Justification: The query mentions "while it is uncertain whether or not a condition has been fulfilled," directly addressing this factor.

2. **The rights of the party concerned may be disposed of while the condition's outcome is uncertain.**
   ➡ (query entails disposition of rights during uncertainty)  
   Justification: The query includes "the rights and obligations of the party concerned may be disposed of" during the uncertainty, covering this aspect.

3. **The obligations of the party concerned may be disposed of while the condition's outcome is uncertain.**
   ➡ (query entails disposition of obligations during uncertainty)  
   Justification: Similar to factor 2, the query mentions "the rights and obligations" may be disposed of, indicating that obligations are also included.

4. **Disposition, inheritance, or preservation of the party's rights and obligations can occur in accordance with general provisions during the uncertainty.**
   ➡ (query entails disposition, inheritance, or preservation in accordance with usual provisions)  
   Justification: The query states these actions can happen "in accordance with the usual provisions of the law," aligning with this factor.

5. **A security may be provided for the rights and obligations of the party concerned while the condition's fulfillment is uncertain.**
   ➡ (query entails provision of security during uncertainty)  
   Justification: The query mentions "or any security may be provided therefor," indicating that security can indeed be provided, which matches this factor.

The justifications for all factors align with the conclusion from Task 1, confirming that the query is **True** based on the information provided in Article 129 and its breakdown.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the article's verdict and the query's verdict discuss the rights and obligations of "the party concerned" without specifying any difference in the parties involved, it is reasonable to conclude that they refer to the same legal principles applying to the same type of defendant or party. Therefore, the answer to whether they apply to the same defendant is:
• (verdict Yes)

 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the articles. Here is the list of factors:

1. A minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned.
2. The permission for a minor to conduct business may be revoked or limited by the legal representative if there are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.
3. A minor must obtain the consent of the minor's legal representative to perform a juridical act.
4. The requirement for a minor to obtain consent from their legal representative does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation.
5. A juridical act performed by a minor without the required consent is voidable.
6. A minor may freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of for a specified purpose, to an extent that falls within the scope of that purpose.
7. A minor may also freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of without specifying a purpose.

Verdict: A juridical act in contravention of the provisions is voidable. 

Note: I excluded the verdict sentence from the list of factors and formatted it separately as instructed. The factors are presented in a single order, combining elements from both Article 5 and Article 6.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 law cases that meet the instructions.

**Case 1:** A minor, with permission from their legal representative, conducts a business and enters into a contract without obtaining consent for the specific juridical act. However, the business is within the scope of what they were permitted to conduct.
Justification: Since the minor was permitted to conduct the business (Factor 1), but did not obtain consent for the specific juridical act (contravening Factor 3), the act is voidable (Verdict). But considering Factor 1, the verdict leans towards No because the minor has the capacity to act as an adult in that business.
Output: (1, 3) | N

**Case 2:** A minor disposes of property without permission from their legal representative for a purpose not specified by the representative.
Justification: The minor did not obtain consent (contravening Factor 3), and since the disposal was not for a specified purpose or without any permission (not aligning with Factors 6 or 7), the act is more clearly voidable. Thus, the defendant is pledged.
Output: (3) | Y

**Case 3:** A minor's legal representative permits them to dispose of property for a specific purpose, and the minor acts within that scope.
Justification: Since the minor acted within the scope permitted by their legal representative (Factor 6), they are not in contravention of the provisions. Thus, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (6) | N

**Case 4:** A minor performs a juridical act to acquire a right without obtaining consent from their legal representative.
Justification: According to Factor 4, consent is not required for acquiring a right or being released from an obligation. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (4) | N

**Case 5:** A minor's permission to conduct business is revoked by their legal representative due to inability to sustain it, but before the revocation, they entered into a contract related to that business.
Justification: Although the minor had permission initially (Factor 1), the subsequent revocation (Factor 2) indicates an issue with their capacity to sustain the business. However, acts done before the revocation, assuming they were within the permitted scope, would not be voidable solely based on the revocation. Thus, considering the timing and Factor 1, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (1, 2) | N

These cases demonstrate different combinations of factors leading to determinations of whether the defendants are pledged or not, in accordance with the provided articles and instructions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis into the required steps.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that A, a nineteen-year-old male under parental authority, cannot rescind a contract for sale concluded without his parents' consent, even though the contract is not related to the business he was permitted to carry on. 

Given the factors:
1. A minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned.
2. The permission for a minor to conduct business may be revoked or limited by the legal representative if there are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.
3. A minor must obtain the consent of the minor's legal representative to perform a juridical act.
4. The requirement for a minor to obtain consent from their legal representative does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation.
5. A juridical act performed by a minor without the required consent is voidable.
6. A minor may freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of for a specified purpose, to an extent that falls within the scope of that purpose.
7. A minor may also freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of without specifying a purpose.

The query suggests that because A was permitted to carry on business, he might have some level of autonomy in his actions outside that specific business. However, factor 1 specifically mentions that the capacity to act as an adult is limited to "that business." Since the contract for sale is not concerned with such business and was concluded without parental consent, it should be considered voidable according to factor 5.

However, the query claims A may not rescind the contract for sale. This seems to contradict the general principle that a juridical act performed by a minor without required consent is voidable (factor 5), unless specific conditions or exceptions apply that are not detailed in the provided factors. Based on the information given and logical reasoning, it appears there might be an oversight or a specific condition not covered by the listed factors that would prevent A from rescinding the contract.

Given this analysis, without additional context or clarifying factors, the query's statement seems to lean towards being False based on the general principles outlined. The ability to rescind should typically align with whether the act is voidable due to lack of consent.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. A minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned.
➡ (query entails 1) - The query mentions A was permitted to carry on business, implying this principle applies to him within the scope of that business.

2. The permission for a minor to conduct business may be revoked or limited by the legal representative if there are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.
➡ (query does not directly entail 2) - There is no mention of revocation or limitation of business permission in the query.

3. A minor must obtain the consent of the minor's legal representative to perform a juridical act.
➡ (query entails 3) - The query implies A did not obtain consent for the contract, which is a juridical act.

4. The requirement for a minor to obtain consent from their legal representative does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation.
➡ (query does not directly entail 4) - The query's scenario involves a contract for sale, which might not fall under the exceptions mentioned.

5. A juridical act performed by a minor without the required consent is voidable.
➡ (query entails 5 indirectly) - While the query suggests A cannot rescind the contract, it implies the contract was made without consent, touching on the principle of voidability.

6. A minor may freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of for a specified purpose, to an extent that falls within the scope of that purpose.
➡ (query does not directly entail 6) - The query does not specify disposal of property for a specified purpose.

7. A minor may also freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of without specifying a purpose.
➡ (query does not directly entail 7) - Similar to factor 6, there's no direct mention of disposing of property without a specified purpose.

Justifications generally align with the analysis from Task 1, indicating the query touches on several key factors but might misinterpret or overlook specific conditions regarding voidability and consent for juridical acts outside permitted business activities.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the query's scenario and the articles' principles, both are concerned with the legal capacities and limitations of minors (in this case, A) in performing juridical acts without proper consent. Therefore, both verdicts indeed refer to the same type of defendant - a minor acting without full legal capacity due to age and dependency on parental authority.

• (verdict Yes) 

This conclusion is based on the understanding that both the query and the articles deal with the legal implications of minors' actions under similar circumstances of dependency and limited legal capacity.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors from Article 537, I will generate 7 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case assumes a unique combination of factors and provides a determined verdict.

**Case 1:**
(<factor 1>, <factor 2>, <factor 3> | Y)
In this case, a contract exists where one party promises to render a certain performance to a third party (Factor 1), the contract promises a certain performance to be rendered by one of the parties to a third party (Factor 2), and the third party has the right to claim the promised performance directly from the obligor (Factor 3). Therefore, the defendant is pledged to render the performance.

**Case 2:**
(<factor 4>, <factor 5> | N)
In this case, the validity of the contract is not affected by the existence or specification of the third party at the time of its formation (Factor 4), but there is no evidence that a contract promises a certain performance to be rendered by one of the parties to a third party. Since Factor 5 only states that the third party may or may not exist, it does not directly impact the verdict. The defendant is not pledged.

**Case 3:**
(<factor 7>, <factor 8> | Y)
In this case, rights of the third party accrue when the third party manifests intention to avail of the benefit of the contract (Factor 7), and the manifestation of intention by the third party must be directed to the obligor (Factor 8). Since the third party has manifested their intention to claim the performance, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 4:**
(<factor 2>, <factor 6> | N)
In this case, a contract promises a certain performance to be rendered by one of the parties to a third party (Factor 2), but the third party may or may not be specified at the time of the contract's formation (Factor 6). Without evidence that the third party has manifested intention to claim the performance, the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 5:**
(<factor 1>, <factor 4> | Y)
In this case, a contract exists where one party promises to render a certain performance to a third party (Factor 1), and the validity of the contract is not affected by the existence or specification of the third party at the time of its formation (Factor 4). Therefore, the defendant is pledged to render the performance.

**Case 6:**
(<factor 3>, <factor 7> | Y)
In this case, the third party has the right to claim the promised performance directly from the obligor (Factor 3), and rights of the third party accrue when the third party manifests intention to avail of the benefit of the contract (Factor 7). Since both conditions are met, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 7:**
(<factor 5>, <factor 8> | N)
In this case, the third party may or may not exist at the time of the contract's formation (Factor 5), and the manifestation of intention by the third party must be directed to the obligor (Factor 8). However, without evidence that a contract promises a certain performance to be rendered by one of the parties to a third party, the defendant is not pledged.

These cases demonstrate how different combinations of factors from Article 537 can lead to varying verdicts regarding whether the defendant is pledged.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query describes a situation where person A sells a jewel to person B, with the agreement that person B will pay the purchase money to person C. Person C expresses their intention to enjoy the benefit of this contract, which aligns with factor 7 (rights of the third party accrue when the third party manifests intention to avail of the benefit of the contract). According to Article 537, if a contract promises a performance to a third party, that third party has the right to claim the promised performance directly from the obligor (factor 3), which in this case is person B. However, the query also states that person A can demand payment from person B to be paid to person C, suggesting an additional contractual relationship or condition not explicitly covered by the factors related to third-party beneficiary contracts.

Given the information and focusing strictly on the logic provided by Article 537 regarding third-party beneficiary contracts, it seems that while person C has the right to demand payment from person B (as per factor 3), the contract between person A and person B, with its condition of paying person C, introduces a complexity. The factors primarily discuss the rights of the third party (person C) against the obligor (person B), not the original seller's (person A) rights in this specific contractual setup. However, since person A delivered the jewel to person B and the contract stipulates that person B should pay the purchase money to person C, it can be argued that person A has a legitimate interest in ensuring the payment is made as per their agreement with person B, thus indirectly supporting the query's statement.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and considering the contractual relationships described, the query appears to be True because both person C and person A have legitimate claims regarding the payment, albeit based on different aspects of the contractual agreements in place.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A contract exists where one party promises to render a certain performance to a third party.**
➡ The query entails this factor because it describes a situation where person B is assigned to pay the purchase money to person C, indicating a contractual promise involving a third party (person C).

2. **The contract promises a certain performance to be rendered by one of the parties to a third party.**
➡ The query entails this factor as person B's contract includes paying the purchase money to person C, which is a promised performance to a third party.

3. **The third party has the right to claim the promised performance directly from the obligor.**
➡ The query entails this factor since it mentions that person C can demand payment from person B, indicating person C's right as a third-party beneficiary.

4. **The validity of the contract is not affected by the existence or specification of the third party at the time of its formation.**
➡ The query does not directly address this factor because it does not discuss the timing of person C's existence or specification in relation to the contract's formation.

5. **The third party may or may not exist at the time of the contract's formation.**
➡ Similar to factor 4, the query does not explicitly address this aspect, as it doesn't specify whether person C existed or was specified at the time of the contract between person A and person B.

6. **The third party may or may not be specified at the time of the contract's formation.**
➡ Again, this factor is not directly addressed in the query for the same reasons as factors 4 and 5.

7. **Rights of the third party accrue when the third party manifests intention to avail of the benefit of the contract.**
➡ The query entails this factor because it mentions that person C expressed their intention to enjoy the benefit of the contract, after which they can demand payment from person B.

8. **The manifestation of intention by the third party must be directed to the obligor.**
➡ The query does not explicitly state that person C's manifestation of intention was directed to person B (the obligor), so it does not clearly entail this factor based on the information provided.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 537 discuss scenarios where a third party is promised a performance, and in both cases, the focus is on the rights of the third party against the obligor (person B in the query), it can be argued that:

• **(verdict Yes)** if considering the primary contractual relationship discussed (between the obligor and the third-party beneficiary).

However, the query introduces an additional layer involving person A's rights, which complicates a straightforward "yes" answer without considering the context of each verdict. The article's verdict primarily concerns the third party's right against the obligor, whereas the query also involves the original seller's (person A) claim against person B, albeit in the context of ensuring payment to person C.

The final answer is: $\boxed{True}$

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the number of factors). Each case will assume a different set of factors and provide a justified verdict.

**Case 1:** 
The owner of immovables acquires ownership of a thing that has been attached thereto as its appurtenance. The attachment was done by another person, but there is no mention of the other person attaching the thing by virtue of a title.
(1, 2 | Y)

Justification: Since factor 3 (attachment by virtue of a title) is not present, and factor 4 (rights of the other person not prejudiced) is also not applicable in this scenario as there's no mention of any title, the owner of immovables can acquire ownership without violating any rights based on titles.

**Case 2:** 
The thing was attached to the immovable by another person who had a valid title for doing so. However, the attachment does not specify that it was done as an appurtenance.
(2, 3 | N)

Justification: The absence of factor 1 (acquiring ownership of a thing attached as an appurtenance) means the conditions under which the owner of immovables can automatically acquire ownership are not met. Factor 4 (rights of the other person not prejudiced) could potentially be at issue, but the primary concern is the lack of indication that the attachment was meant to create an appurtenance.

**Case 3:** 
The owner of immovables attempts to acquire a thing that was attached by another person without any title. However, this attachment was clearly done as an appurtenance.
(1, 2 | Y)

Justification: Given that factor 3 (attachment by virtue of a title) is not present, implying the other person did not have a legal basis for attaching the thing with the intent of retaining ownership or rights, and assuming factor 4 (rights of the other person not prejudiced) does not apply because there's no valid title to consider, the owner can acquire ownership.

**Case 4:** 
All factors are present: The owner of immovables acquires ownership of a thing attached as its appurtenance, another person did the attachment by virtue of a title, and this attachment was done in such a manner that the rights of the other person are not prejudiced.
(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)

Justification: Since all conditions are met, including the crucial aspect that the rights of the other person who attached the thing by virtue of a title are not prejudiced, the owner of immovables can indeed acquire ownership of the thing that has been attached thereto as its appurtenance.

These cases cover different combinations of factors and provide verdicts based on the presence or absence of specific conditions outlined in the article.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The article states that the owner of immovables acquires ownership of a thing that has been attached thereto as its appurtenance, provided the rights of the other person who attached the thing by virtue of a title are not prejudiced. In the query, A sows seed owned by A on land owned by B without title. The key points here are:

- A does not own the land.
- A sowed the seeds without having a title to the land (implying without permission or legal right).
- The seeds grow into seedlings.

Given these points, the article suggests that if something is attached to an immovable (like seeds being sown in the ground), it becomes part of that immovable under certain conditions. However, for B to acquire ownership of the seedling, it must be considered an appurtenance to B's land and not prejudice A's rights as the owner of the seeds.

Since A sowed the seeds without title (or permission) on B's land, the act could be seen as attaching something to B's immovable. However, the critical aspect is whether this attachment prejudices A's rights or if it's done by virtue of a title (which in this case, it is not). The article primarily protects the rights of the person who attached the thing by virtue of a title, but A does not have such a title to B's land.

Thus, based on the information given and applying logical reasoning, the query seems to be **True** because B, as the owner of the land, could potentially claim ownership of the seedlings as they are now part of B's immovable property (the land), assuming that A's actions do not constitute a valid title or right to the land or its appurtenances.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The owner of immovables acquires ownership of a thing that has been attached thereto as its appurtenance.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because the scenario involves seeds being sown on B's land, which could be considered as attaching something to an immovable, thereby potentially transferring ownership to B.

2. **The attachment of the thing to the immovable is done by another person.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) since A, a different person from the owner B, attaches the seeds (thing) to B's immovable (land).

3. **The other person attaches the thing by virtue of a title.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) because A does not have a title or permission to sow seeds on B's land, indicating the attachment was not done by virtue of a legitimate title.

4. **The rights of the other person that attached the thing are not prejudiced.**
   ➡ (query entails consideration of this factor indirectly) as the scenario implies a potential conflict between A's ownership of the seeds and B's potential claim to them once they become part of the land. However, it does not explicitly state how A's rights are affected or protected.

Justifications align with Task 1's result, considering the nuances of property law and attachment of movable to immovable properties.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that the query concludes with B owning the seedling and the article discusses conditions under which an owner of immovables acquires ownership of attached things, we consider if both verdicts pertain to the same party:

- The article's verdict applies to the "owner of immovables," who in the context of the query is B.
- The query's verdict also concludes with B acquiring ownership.

Therefore, **(verdict Yes)** because both the query and the article ultimately refer to the owner of the immovable property (B) as the party acquiring or potentially acquiring ownership of the thing attached to their property.

2. No cases have same set of factors. Case must give a determined verdict either Yes or No.
3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 133, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors, which is 5: 3 factors and 2 verdicts). Each case assumes a different set of factors.

**Case 1:** 
The defendant enters into a contract to sell a plot of land that does not exist. The sale is subject to an impossible condition precedent, namely, that the buyer must first own the moon.
Justification: Since the condition precedent (owning the moon) is impossible, according to Article 133(1), the juridical act (the contract to sell the land) is void. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (Factor 1) | N

**Case 2:** 
The defendant enters into a contract to provide services subject to an impossible condition subsequent, namely, that the world must end on a specific date in the future.
Justification: Since the condition subsequent (the world ending on a specific date) is impossible and follows the initial agreement, according to Article 133(2), the juridical act becomes an unconditional one. Thus, the defendant remains pledged to provide the services regardless of the impossibility of the condition subsequent.
Output: (Factor 2) | Y

**Case 3:** 
The defendant signs a contract with a condition that classifies as both precedent and subsequent but is impossible. The condition requires that the defendant must have already performed an act that contradicts the laws of physics before signing the contract and also stipulates that the payment will be made after the same impossible act is performed again.
Justification: Given that Article 133 does not explicitly cover conditions that are both precedent and subsequent or how to treat a condition that defies classification in such a manner, it's challenging to apply directly. However, considering the spirit of the article, if we were to interpret this as primarily falling under an impossible condition precedent due to its initial impossibility, then according to Article 133(1), the juridical act could be considered void. Therefore, the defendant might not be pledged.
Output: (Factor 1, Factor 3) | N

**Case 4:** 
The defendant enters into a contract that is subject to no conditions at all, neither precedent nor subsequent.
Justification: Since Article 133 specifically addresses juridical acts subject to impossible conditions (either precedent or subsequent), and this contract has no such conditions, it does not fall under the provisions of Article 133. By default, without any conditions affecting its validity, the contract is considered unconditional and valid. Thus, the defendant remains pledged.
Output: | Y

Note: In Case 4, since there are no specific factors (1, 2, or 3) directly applicable from the article's description, the output reflects the absence of these factors but confirms the defendant's pledge based on the contract being unconditional and valid by default.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a juristic act subject to a condition subsequent which is impossible shall be void. According to the breakdown of Article 133:
- A juridical act subject to an impossible condition precedent is void.
- A juridical act subject to an impossible condition subsequent is considered an unconditional juridical act.

Given this information, the query's assertion that a juristic act with an impossible condition subsequent should be void contradicts the verdict from Article 133, which states such an act would be unconditional, not void. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the provided verdicts, the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A juridical act is subject to an impossible condition precedent.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it specifically mentions a condition subsequent, not a condition precedent.

2. **A juridical act is subject to an impossible condition subsequent.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) The query directly addresses the scenario of a juristic act being subject to an impossible condition subsequent.

3. **The condition is classified as either precedent or subsequent.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) The query explicitly mentions a condition subsequent, thereby classifying the condition into one of these categories.

Justification for all factors aligns with understanding that the query focuses on conditions subsequent and their implications when impossible, not on conditions precedent or the general classification of conditions without specifying their type.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The query's verdict suggests that a juristic act subject to an impossible condition subsequent should be void. In contrast, Article 133's verdict states that such an act is considered unconditional. Given this discrepancy:
• (verdict No) The query’s verdict and the article’s verdict do not apply to the same outcome for the defendant because one suggests the act would be void (query), while the other indicates it would be unconditional (Article 133).

In summary, based on the tasks:
1. The query is **False** according to Article 133's breakdown.
2. The query entails discussing an impossible condition subsequent and classifying conditions but does not address impossible conditions precedent directly.
3. The verdicts from the query and Article 133 do not align regarding the outcome for a juristic act subject to an impossible condition subsequent, indicating they apply to different outcomes for the defendant.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down each task step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "If the assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the assistant's consent, at the request of the person under assistance."

Based on the information provided:
- The conditions for the family court to grant permission in lieu of the assistant's consent include the act not prejudicing the interests of the person under assistance (factor 7) and the assistant not consenting (factor 6).
- These conditions match the scenario described in the query.

Therefore, logically, if the assistant does not consent and it is unlikely that the act will prejudice the interests of the person under assistance, the family court may indeed grant permission. This makes the query **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The person referred to in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1) may request the family court to decide that the person under assistance must obtain the consent of the person's assistant.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor as it discusses a scenario where consent is already required and not granted, rather than the initial decision for consent requirement.

2. **The assistant or assistant's supervisor may also request the family court to decide that the person under assistance must obtain the consent of the person's assistant.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it focuses on a situation after the requirement for consent has been established, not on who can request such a decision.

3. **The family court may decide that the person under assistance must obtain the consent of the person's assistant in order to perform a specific juridical act.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor indirectly because it discusses a scenario involving an act for which consent is required, implying a prior decision by the family court.

4. **The acts for which the person must obtain the consent of the assistant are restricted to a part of the acts provided for in Article 13, paragraph (1).**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor as it doesn't specify the nature or scope of acts restricted by Article 13, paragraph (1).

5. **A request from a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question to decide as referred to in paragraph (1).**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it discusses a scenario where the person under assistance is requesting permission due to the assistant's lack of consent, not a decision requiring consent from someone else.

6. **The assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor directly as it specifically mentions the assistant not consenting.

7. **It is unlikely that the act will prejudice the interests of the person under assistance.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor directly because it states the condition that the act is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance.

The justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1, supporting the query as **True** based on the factors provided.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The query's verdict is about the family court granting permission in lieu of the assistant's consent at the request of the person under assistance.
- The article’s verdict, as stated, allows for similar decisions regarding consent and acts by or on behalf of the person under assistance.

Therefore, both verdicts pertain to decisions affecting the **same defendant**, namely, the person under assistance.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 5 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors.

**Case 1:**
The agent made a manifestation of intention without the principal's knowledge, and it was influenced by mistake (factor 2) and negligence in not knowing a particular circumstance (factor 6). The principal wants to assert that the agent did not know of a particular circumstance.
Output: (2, 6 | N)
Justification: Since the agent's manifestation of intention was influenced by mistake and negligence, and the principal is trying to assert that the agent did not know of a particular circumstance, the verdict would be No, as the principal cannot assert this due to the agent's performance of the juridical act (Article 101(3)).

**Case 2:**
The other party made a manifestation of intention to the agent, which was influenced by fraud (factor 3) and the recipient's (agent's) knowledge of a particular circumstance (factor 8). The principal wants to assert that the agent did not know of this circumstance.
Output: (3, 8 | Y)
Justification: Since the other party's manifestation of intention was influenced by fraud and the agent had knowledge of the particular circumstance, the verdict would be Yes, as the principal can assert that the agent did not know of this circumstance due to the agent's own knowledge.

**Case 3:**
The agent performed a specific juridical act, and the principal wants to assert that the agent did not know of a particular circumstance of which the principal knew (factor 10). However, the principal's own negligence in not knowing this circumstance (factor 11) is also a factor.
Output: (10, 11 | N)
Justification: Since the principal's own negligence in not knowing the circumstance is a factor, and the agent performed the juridical act, the verdict would be No, as the principal cannot assert that the agent did not know of this circumstance due to their own negligence (Article 101(3)).

**Case 4:**
The agent made a manifestation of intention influenced by duress (factor 4) and absence of intention (factor 1). The other party wants to assert that the agent knew of a particular circumstance.
Output: (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: Since the agent's manifestation of intention was influenced by duress and absence of intention, the verdict would be Yes, as the other party can assert that the agent knew of the particular circumstance due to the agent's performance of the juridical act.

**Case 5:**
The other party made a manifestation of intention to the agent, which was influenced by the recipient's (agent's) negligence in not knowing a particular circumstance (factor 9). The principal wants to assert that the agent did not know of this circumstance.
Output: (9 | Y)
Justification: Since the other party's manifestation of intention was influenced by the agent's negligence in not knowing the particular circumstance, the verdict would be Yes, as the principal can assert that the agent did not know of this circumstance due to the agent's own negligence.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1: Determining the Truth of the Query

The query states that if an agent who has been entrusted with performing a specific judicial act performs that act, the principal may not assert that the agent did not know of any particular circumstance of which the principal knew, only if the agent performed that act in accordance with the instructions of the principal. 

To evaluate whether this statement is True or False based on logical reasoning:

- The original verdict states that a principal may not assert that an agent did not know of any particular circumstance of which the principal knew when the agent performs a specific juridical act.
- It also mentions that the same applies to circumstances the principal did not know due to their own negligence, without conditioning this on the agent acting in accordance with instructions.

The query introduces a condition ("only if the agent performed that act in accordance with the instructions of the principal") not present in the original verdicts. This condition narrows down the scenarios under which the principal cannot assert the agent's lack of knowledge, suggesting a more specific set of circumstances than what is outlined in the original article.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and comparing the query to the original verdicts, the query appears to introduce an additional requirement not specified in the original text. This means that while the core concept (regarding the principal's knowledge and its implications for assertions about the agent's knowledge) aligns with the original verdicts, the addition of a conditional clause ("only if...") makes the query more restrictive than the general principle stated.

Thus, considering the additional condition introduced by the query, it does not perfectly align with the unconditional statements provided in the article. Hence, we can reason that the query's truth value is **False** when compared directly to the original verdicts without the conditional clause.

### Task 2: Assessing Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent can be influenced by the absence of intention.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query focuses on knowledge and performance in accordance with instructions, not directly addressing intentions.

2. **The validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent can be influenced by mistake.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - Mistake is not mentioned or implied as affecting the scenario described in the query.

3. **The validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent can be influenced by fraud.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - Fraud is not considered within the context of the query.

4. **The validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent can be influenced by duress.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - Dures is not mentioned or implied in the query's scenario.

5. **The validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent can be influenced by the knowledge of a particular circumstance.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query specifically addresses the principal's and agent's knowledge of circumstances.

6. **The validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent can be influenced by negligence in not knowing a particular circumstance.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor but implies knowledge issues) - While negligence isn't explicitly mentioned, the query touches on implications of knowledge or lack thereof.

7. **Whether or not any fact that influences the validity of a manifestation of intention was present is decided as it concerns the agent, when the other party has made a manifestation to the agent.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - The query doesn't explicitly address how facts influencing manifestations are decided.

8. **The recipient's (agent's) knowledge of a particular circumstance can influence the validity of a manifestation of intention made by the other party.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The agent's performance based on what they knew or should have known is considered.

9. **The recipient's (agent's) negligence in not knowing a particular circumstance can influence the validity of a manifestation of intention made by the other party.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor but touches on knowledge) - Similar to factor 6, it implies issues with knowledge but doesn't explicitly address negligence.

10. **An agent's performance of a specific juridical act can be influenced by the principal's knowledge of a particular circumstance.**
    ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query directly addresses how an agent's action might relate to what the principal knew.

11. **A principal's own negligence in not knowing a particular circumstance can affect their ability to assert that the agent did not know of that circumstance.**
    ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - While it discusses knowledge, it doesn't explicitly address negligence on the part of the principal in terms of not knowing.

### Task 3: Determining Whether the Query’s Verdict and the Article’s Verdict Apply to the Same Defendant

Given that both the query and the article discuss scenarios involving a principal and an agent, with the focus being on what the principal can or cannot assert regarding the agent's knowledge when the agent performs a specific act, it appears they are addressing similar legal relationships and responsibilities. However, the query adds a condition (performance in accordance with instructions) not found in the original verdicts.

- **(verdict Yes)** if they refer to the same defendant: In this context, "defendant" can be understood as the party whose actions or assertions are being evaluated (the principal). Both the query and the article's verdicts pertain to the principal's ability to make certain assertions about the agent's knowledge.

Therefore, despite the query introducing a conditional aspect not present in the original verdicts, both essentially apply to the same defendant (the principal) in terms of their legal standing and the implications of their knowledge on assertions made about the agent. 

**Result:** 
- **Task 1:** False
- **Task 2:** Justifications provided for each factor.
- **Task 3:** • (verdict Yes)

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis into the required steps:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query suggests that in cases where an adult concluded a contract and later became subject to a ruling of commencement of guardianship, the guardian of the adult may rescind the contract by proving there is a ground for commencement of guardianship. 

Given the context provided by Article 120, acts are voidable on grounds such as qualified legal capacity to act, mistake, fraud, or duress. The article specifically mentions that an act can be rescinded by the person with qualified legal capacity (or their agent/successor) if the issue is with their capacity, and similarly, by the person who made a defective manifestation of intention (or their agent/successor) in cases of mistake, fraud, or duress.

The query seems to imply that the commencement of guardianship (which likely impacts the individual's legal capacity) allows for the contract to be rescinded. This scenario aligns with the principle that if a person's legal capacity is compromised (as might be indicated by the commencement of guardianship), then actions taken under such circumstances could potentially be voidable.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the context provided, it appears the query could be considered **True**, as it seems to reflect a scenario where the legal capacity of the individual is in question due to the commencement of guardianship proceedings.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **An act is voidable on the grounds of the qualified legal capacity to act of the person who did the act.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because the scenario involves an adult whose legal capacity is later questioned due to the commencement of guardianship, implying their capacity at the time of the contract might have been compromised.

2. **The person with qualified legal capacity has the authority to rescind the act, including when the act was performed by a person as a legal representative of another person with limited capacity.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) indirectly, as it discusses the guardian's ability to rescind the contract on behalf of the adult, suggesting a scenario where legal representation is involved due to compromised capacity.

3. **The act may also be rescinded by an agent or successor of the person with qualified legal capacity.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because the guardian can be seen as an agent or successor acting on behalf of the individual whose capacity is in question.

4. **The act may also be rescinded by a person who has the authority to give consent thereto, in cases where the act is voidable due to the qualified legal capacity to act.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as it involves a guardian who presumably has the authority to give consent on behalf of the individual under guardianship.

5. **An act is voidable on the grounds of a mistake, fraud, or duress.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) since the query specifically discusses issues related to legal capacity rather than mistake, fraud, or duress.

6. **The person who made the defective manifestation of intention has the authority to rescind the act that is voidable due to a mistake, fraud, or duress.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) for the same reason as above; it focuses on capacity rather than mistake, fraud, or duress.

7. **An agent or successor of the person who made the defective manifestation of intention may also rescind the act.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) because, although it mentions a guardian acting on behalf of another, it's in the context of capacity rather than mistake, fraud, or duress.

These justifications align with the logical reasoning provided in Task 1 that suggests the query is **True** within the context of legal capacity issues.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information and analysis:
- The article's verdict discusses acts being rescinded by individuals with qualified legal capacity (or their agents/successors) and those who made defective manifestations of intention (or their agents/successors).
- The query’s verdict involves a guardian rescinding a contract on behalf of an adult under guardianship, implying the adult is the original party to the contract.

Considering these points:
• **(verdict Yes)** if we interpret "defendant" broadly as the party whose actions or capacities are in question. Both scenarios involve acts potentially being voidable due to issues with the individual's capacity or representation at the time of the act, suggesting they apply to the same type of defendant—individuals whose legal capacity or manifestations of intention are compromised.

However, if "defendant" is interpreted strictly as the party directly involved in a legal dispute, there might be a distinction based on the specific context (e.g., who is being sued). Given the information provided and focusing on the core issue of legal capacity and representation, it seems most appropriate to consider that both verdicts apply to scenarios involving individuals whose capacity or intentions are in question.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors from Article 533, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the number of factors). Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
The defendant is a party to a bilateral contract and refuses to perform their own obligation because the other party has not tendered their performance. The other party's obligation is due.
(1, 2, 4 | Y)

Justification: Since the defendant is refusing to perform until the other party tenders their performance (factor 1 and 2), and the other party's obligation is due (factor 4), the defendant is justified in refusing to perform. Verdict: Yes.

**Case 2:** 
The defendant is a party to a bilateral contract but refuses to perform their own obligation even though the other party's obligation is not yet due.
(1, 5 | N)

Justification: Although the defendant is a party to a bilateral contract and may refuse to perform (factor 1), the other party's obligation is not yet due (factor 5). According to Article 533, this means the defendant may not refuse to perform. Verdict: No.

**Case 3:** 
The defendant is a party to a bilateral contract and refuses to perform their own obligation until the other party compensates for loss or damage in lieu of performance.
(1, 3 | Y)

Justification: The defendant is refusing to perform until the other party tenders their performance, which includes compensation for loss or damage (factor 1 and 3). This is allowed under Article 533. Verdict: Yes.

**Case 4:** 
The defendant is a party to a bilateral contract but refuses to perform their own obligation without considering whether the other party has tendered their performance.
(1 | N)

Justification: Although the defendant is a party to a bilateral contract and may refuse to perform (factor 1), there is no indication that they have considered whether the other party has tendered their performance. Without this consideration, the defendant's refusal to perform is not justified under Article 533. Verdict: No.

Note: The numbers in parentheses refer to the factor numbers from the article. Y indicates a verdict of Yes (the defendant is justified), and N indicates a verdict of No (the defendant is not justified).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query discusses a scenario where a buyer alleges a defense for simultaneous performance in a bilateral contract, and the seller responds with an agreement that payment would be made prior to delivery and registration of ownership transfer. The key points from Article 533 are about the conditions under which a party can refuse to perform their obligations in a bilateral contract.

Given this context, the query seems to present a plausible legal strategy (re-defense) by the seller, suggesting that the original agreement may have specified a sequence of performances (payment before delivery and registration), which could be seen as an exception to the simultaneous performance defense. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and without more specific details from Article 533, it appears that the query could be considered True in certain legal contexts where such agreements are valid and recognized.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A party to a bilateral contract may refuse to perform their own obligation**: 
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The seller's re-defense implies refusal to deliver without prior payment, which aligns with refusing performance until the other party fulfills their part of the agreement.

2. **The refusal to perform is until the other party tenders the performance of that other party's obligation**:
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The seller's argument hinges on the buyer paying first, indicating a refusal to perform (deliver) until the buyer tends their performance (payment).

3. **The tendered performance includes the performance of an obligation to compensate for loss or damage in lieu of the performance of an obligation**:
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - The query focuses on payment before delivery and registration, without explicitly mentioning compensation for loss or damage.

4. **The obligation of the other party must be due for the refusal to perform to be valid**:
   ➡ (query entails this factor indirectly) - By specifying an agreement where payment precedes delivery, it implies that the buyer's obligation (payment) is considered due before the seller's obligation (delivery and registration).

5. **If the obligation of the other party is not yet due, the party may not refuse to perform their own obligation**:
   ➡ (query does not directly address this factor) - The query assumes a prior agreement altering the typical simultaneous performance expectation, so it doesn't directly discuss what happens if an obligation isn't yet due.

Justifications align with the logical reasoning that the query presents a scenario where legal principles of bilateral contracts and performance timing are relevant, supporting the assessment from Task 1 that the query could be considered True under specific conditions.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario and Article 533 discuss a party's right to refuse performance in a bilateral contract based on the other party's obligation, it appears they refer to similar legal principles applicable to either party in such contracts. Therefore:
- (verdict Yes) - The query and the article seem to apply general principles that could apply to any defendant (or plaintiff) in a bilateral contract dispute regarding simultaneous performance or the timing of obligations.

In summary, based on logical reasoning, the query seems plausible under certain conditions (Task 1), it entails several factors related to Article 533 with some direct relevance and others indirectly or not at all (Task 2), and both the query's scenario and the article's principles apply broadly to defendants in bilateral contract disputes regarding performance timing (Task 3).

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a determined verdict.

**Case 1:** 
The obligee notifies the original obligor about the contract with the new obligor. 
(2 | Y)
Justification: Since factor 2 is present, which states that "The novation becomes effective when the obligee notifies the obligor prior to the novation of the conclusion of the contract", it implies that the novation is effective. Therefore, the defendant (new obligor) is pledged.

**Case 2:** 
A contract is concluded between the obligee and a new person to become the obligor after novation.
(1 | Y)
Justification: Factor 1 states "A novation by substitution of obligor may be effected by a contract concluded between the obligee and a person that becomes the obligor after the novation". This means a novation can occur, implying the defendant could be pledged under this condition.

**Case 3:** 
The new obligor attempts to claim reimbursement from the original obligor.
(3 | N)
Justification: According to factor 3, "The obligor after the novation by substitution of obligor does not acquire a right to reimbursement from the obligor prior to the novation". Therefore, if this is the only factor considered, the defendant (new obligor) cannot claim reimbursement and thus is not pledged in this context.

**Case 4:** 
A contract for novation by substitution of obligor is concluded, and the original obligor is notified.
(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The presence of both factors 1 and 2 fulfills the conditions for a novation to be effective (the contract for novation and notification to the original obligor). Thus, the defendant (new obligor) is pledged.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors leading to a determined verdict regarding whether the defendant is pledged.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the information:
- A novation by substitution of obligor (or debtor) essentially means that one party replaces another in a contractual agreement.
- The article states that "The obligor after the novation by substitution of obligor does not acquire a right to reimbursement from the obligor prior to the novation."

The query is: "The debtor after a novation by substitution of debtor does not acquire the right of reimbursement against the debtor before the novation."

Based on logical reasoning, this query aligns with the principle stated in the article regarding novation by substitution of obligor. The terms "obligor" and "debtor" are used interchangeably here to refer to the party who owes an obligation. Therefore, logically, if a novation occurs, the new debtor (or obligor) does not have the right to reimbursement from the previous debtor (or obligor), making the query **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A novation by substitution of obligor may be effected by a contract concluded between the obligee and a person that becomes the obligor after the novation.**
   ➡ The query does not directly express this factor, as it focuses on the outcome regarding reimbursement rights rather than how a novation is effected.

2. **The novation becomes effective when the obligee notifies the obligor prior to the novation of the conclusion of the contract.**
   ➡ The query does not express this factor, as it discusses the result of a novation (regarding reimbursement) and not the process by which a novation becomes effective.

3. **The obligor after the novation by substitution of obligor does not acquire a right to reimbursement from the obligor prior to the novation.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor, as it directly states that "The debtor after a novation by substitution of debtor does not acquire the right of reimbursement against the debtor before the novation," which aligns with the principle outlined in this factor.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is **True** based on the logical reasoning applied to the principles outlined in the factors.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict discusses the "obligor after the novation" not acquiring a right to reimbursement, while the query talks about the "debtor after a novation." Given that "obligor" and "debtor" refer to the party with obligations in a contract, and considering the context of novation by substitution:
• **(verdict Yes)** The query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant, as both refer to the new party taking on obligations after a novation (whether called an obligor or a debtor).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis into steps as requested.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the information from Article 468 and the query, we need to assess if an obligor can refuse to perform their obligation by asserting the cancellation right of the contract against the assignee when the assignee knows the claim is remuneration receivables related to unfinished work. 

The article outlines conditions under which an obligor may assert events against an assignee, particularly focusing on the timing of such assertions in relation to the completion of perfection or other specified periods/events. However, it does not explicitly address the scenario of asserting cancellation rights based on the nature of the claim (unfinished work) when the assignee is aware of this nature.

Logical reasoning suggests that if the assignee is aware that the claim pertains to remuneration for unfinished work, and given the principles outlined in Article 468 about asserting events against the assignee, there might be a basis for the obligor to refuse performance. This would depend on whether the contract's cancellation right can be considered an "event" that has taken place with regard to the assignor by the relevant time frame (perfection or another specified period). Without explicit mention of such scenarios in Article 468, we must consider general legal principles regarding contracts, assignments, and notice.

Based on this analysis, without specific language addressing the scenario, it's challenging to definitively classify the query as True or False solely based on Article 468. However, considering general contract law principles, an obligor might have grounds to assert cancellation rights if they can demonstrate that the assignee's knowledge of the claim's nature (related to unfinished work) impacts the obligation's validity or enforceability.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **An obligor may duly assert against the assignee any event that has taken place with regard to the assignor by the time of completion of the perfection.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it discusses asserting a cancellation right, which could be considered an "event," against the assignee based on the nature of the claim.

2. **The phrase "at the time of the completion of the perfection" is used to determine the relevant time frame for asserting events against the assignee.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) as it doesn't specify timing in relation to perfection but rather focuses on the assignee's knowledge.

3. **In cases referred to in Article 466, paragraph (4), a reasonable period of time has elapsed.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) because there is no mention or implication of Article 466, paragraph (4), or the concept of a "reasonable period of time" elapsing.

4. **The phrase "at the time of the completion of the perfection" is deemed to be replaced with "at the time when a reasonable period of time referred to in Article 466, paragraph (4) has elapsed" for the purpose of applying the provisions.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) since it doesn't reference Article 466 or the replacement of timing phrases.

5. **In cases referred to in Article 466-3, the obligor receives a request from the assignee to make a deposit with an official depository pursuant to the provisions of that Article.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) as there's no mention of Article 466-3 or requests for deposits.

6. **The phrase "at the time of the completion of the perfection" is deemed to be replaced with "at the time when the obligor receives a request from the assignee referred to in Article 466-3 to make a deposit with an official depository pursuant to the provisions of that Article".**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) for similar reasons as factor 5.

Justifications align with the initial assessment that while the query touches on asserting rights against an assignee, it introduces specific scenarios (knowledge of unfinished work claims) not directly addressed in the factors derived from Article 468.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 468 discuss the rights and obligations of the obligor in relation to the assignee, it can be inferred that:
• (verdict Yes) they refer to the same defendant, namely the obligor, as both scenarios concern the obligor's ability to assert certain rights or defenses against the assignee.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 5 law cases with different combinations of factors.

**Case 1:** 
The defendant made a manifestation of intention based on a mistake that was material in light of the purpose of the juridical act (Factor 1). The mistake was one where the person lacked the intention that corresponded to the manifestation of intention (Factor 2). However, the circumstances in question were not indicated as being taken as the basis for the juridical act (not Factor 4).

Output: (1, 2 | Y)

Justification: Since the defendant's mistake was material and they lacked the corresponding intention, their manifestation of intention may be voidable. The verdict is Yes.

**Case 2:** 
The plaintiff made a manifestation of intention based on a mistake due to gross negligence (Factor 5). However, the other party knew about the mistake (Factor 6).

Output: (5, 6 | Y)

Justification: Although the plaintiff's mistake was due to gross negligence, the other party's knowledge of the mistake allows for an exception. The verdict is Yes.

**Case 3:** 
The defendant made a manifestation of intention based on a mistake where they held an understanding that did not correspond to the truth (Factor 3). The circumstances in question were indicated as being taken as the basis for the juridical act (Factor 4).

Output: (3, 4 | Y)

Justification: Since the defendant's mistake was based on incorrect understanding and the circumstances were indicated, their manifestation of intention may be voidable. The verdict is Yes.

**Case 4:** 
A third party acted in good faith without negligence (Factor 8). The original manifestation of intention was based on a material mistake (Factor 1).

Output: (1, 8 | N)

Justification: Although the original manifestation of intention was based on a material mistake, the rescission may not be asserted against a third party acting in good faith without negligence. The verdict is No.

**Case 5:** 
The defendant made a manifestation of intention based on a mistake due to gross negligence (Factor 5). Both parties were under the same mistake (Factor 7).

Output: (5, 7 | Y)

Justification: Since both parties shared the same mistake, an exception applies, and the defendant's manifestation of intention may be voidable despite being due to gross negligence. The verdict is Yes.

Each case has a unique combination of factors, and the justifications lead to a determined verdict of either Yes or No.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that even if there is a mistake in any element of the juristic act in question and manifestation of intention is induced by the mistake, the person who made the manifestation of intention may not assert such nullity of the manifestation of intention by mistake if twenty years has elapsed from the time of the manifestation of intention. This implies a statute of limitations on claiming mistakes in manifestations of intention.

Given the context provided by the factors and verdicts related to mistakes in manifestations of intention, there is no direct information that contradicts or supports the existence of a specific time limit (twenty years) after which a claim of mistake cannot be made. However, the principles outlined suggest that mistakes can indeed lead to voidable or rescinded manifestations of intention under certain conditions, but they do not explicitly mention a time frame like twenty years as a universal rule.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and without explicit information to the contrary within the provided context, it's challenging to definitively label the query as True or False solely based on the given information. However, considering typical legal frameworks that often include statutes of limitations for various claims, the concept presented in the query is plausible.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. A manifestation of intention is based on a mistake that is material in light of the purpose of the juridical act and the common sense in the transaction.
➡ (query entails 1) - The query mentions a "mistake in any element of the juristic act," which aligns with the concept of a material mistake affecting the manifestation of intention.

2. The mistake is one where the person lacks the intention that corresponds to the manifestation of intention.
➡ (query does not directly entail 2) - While the query discusses mistakes, it doesn't explicitly address the scenario where the person's intention does not correspond with their manifestation of intention.

3. The mistake is one where the person making the manifestation of intention holds an understanding that does not correspond to the truth with regard to the circumstances which the person has taken as the basis for the juridical act.
➡ (query entails 3) - The query's mention of a "mistake" implies a misunderstanding or incorrect assumption about the circumstances, aligning with this factor.

4. The circumstances in question are being taken as the basis for the juridical act, and this has been indicated.
➡ (query does not directly entail 4) - The query doesn't specify that the mistake relates to circumstances taken as the basis for the juridical act or that this has been indicated.

5. A mistake is due to gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention.
➡ (query does not directly entail 5) - The query introduces a time limit after which a claim cannot be made but doesn't discuss gross negligence as a factor influencing the validity of the claim.

6. The other party knew, or did not know due to gross negligence, of the mistake on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention.
➡ (query does not entail 6) - There is no mention of the other party's knowledge or negligence in the query.

7. The other party was under the same mistake as the person making the manifestation of intention.
➡ (query does not entail 7) - The query doesn't address the scenario where both parties share the same mistake.

8. A third party is acting in good faith without negligence.
➡ (query does not directly entail 8) - While the concept of a time limit might intersect with principles protecting third-party rights, the query itself does not discuss third-party actions or their state of knowledge/negligence.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

• (verdict Yes) - Both the query and the article's verdicts pertain to the person making the manifestation of intention, focusing on the conditions under which such a manifestation can be voidable or rescinded. The query introduces a time limit as an additional condition affecting the person's ability to claim mistake, but both essentially deal with the rights and limitations of the same party in relation to mistakes in manifestations of intention.

The final answer is: $\boxed{True}$

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, we will proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if the lessee has lost the leased thing due to fire caused through negligence, the lessor may not demand compensation for damages unless the lessee has been with gross negligence. This implies a condition under which the lessor cannot demand compensation, suggesting that there are circumstances where the lessee's liability is mitigated or negated if their negligence was not gross.

Given the context of contractual obligations and the principles of liability, this statement seems to align with general legal principles that differentiate between ordinary negligence and gross negligence. Gross negligence typically implies a more significant breach of duty of care, potentially leading to more severe consequences.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and general legal principles, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor as it discusses a scenario where the leased thing is lost due to negligence, which doesn't necessarily equate to failing to perform an obligation's purpose.

2. **The performance of an obligation is impossible.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because the loss of the leased thing through fire does not inherently make the performance of the obligation (e.g., returning the item or paying rent) impossible; it affects the ability to fulfill a specific aspect of the contract.

3. **The failure to perform the obligation is due to grounds not attributable to the obligor in light of the contract or other sources of obligation and the common sense in the transaction.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor to some extent because it implies that if the lessee's negligence was not gross, the lessor may not demand compensation, suggesting that the failure (loss of the item) might not be entirely attributable to the lessee under certain conditions.

4. **The obligee is entitled to claim compensation for loss or damage pursuant to the provisions of the preceding paragraph.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor inversely by stating a condition under which the lessor (obligee in a broader sense) may not demand compensation, implying there are specific circumstances where compensation can be claimed.

5. **The performance of the obligation is impossible.**
   ➡ As mentioned earlier, the query does not directly entail this factor for similar reasons as factor 2.

6. **The obligor manifests the intention to refuse to perform the obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it discusses an accidental loss (through fire) rather than an intentional refusal to perform an obligation.

7. **The obligation has arisen from a contract, and the contract is cancelled or the obligee acquires the right to cancel the contract on the ground of the obligor's failure to perform the obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor as it focuses on compensation for damages rather than the cancellation of the contract.

Justifications align with the initial assessment that the query is **True**, considering it reflects nuances in liability and negligence within contractual obligations.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the context, both the query's verdict and the article's verdict seem to pertain to scenarios involving obligors (lessees in the query) who fail to meet their obligations due to various reasons. The focus is on when an obligee (lessor in the query) can claim compensation or damages.

• **(verdict Yes)** if they refer to the same defendant: Both verdicts indeed apply to scenarios where the defendant (obligor/lessee) has failed to fulfill their obligations, whether through impossibility, negligence, or refusal. Thus, the answer is **(verdict Yes)**.

Assuming factor 3 occurred, where the act establishing the servitude provides otherwise, which can affect the transfer of servitudes. If the act explicitly states that servitudes cannot be transferred with the dominant land, then the defendant is not pledged.

Output: (3 | N)

**Case 3:**
Assuming factors 4 and 5 occurred, where servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land, and servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land. In this scenario, if someone attempts to transfer or assign servitudes separately from the dominant land, they would be in violation of Article 281, and therefore, the defendant is pledged.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "A servitude may not be established with respect to the land, not neighboring a dominant land, as a servient land."

From the provided factors and the general understanding of servitudes in law, servitudes are typically established between two pieces of land, where one (the dominant land) has a right over the other (the servient land). The establishment of a servitude usually requires a spatial relationship or some form of connection between the lands involved.

Given this context, if a piece of land is not neighboring a dominant land, it does not necessarily mean a servitude cannot be established. Servitudes can exist for various reasons and do not solely depend on the physical proximity of the lands at all times. However, the traditional understanding leans towards servitudes being between neighboring or adjacent lands to facilitate the right (e.g., right of way).

Without explicit information stating that non-neighboring lands cannot have a servitude established under any circumstances, we must consider the possibility based on standard legal principles. Thus, logically reasoning, it seems the query might be leaning towards a False interpretation because servitudes are not strictly limited to neighboring lands in all jurisdictions or situations.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query discusses the establishment of servitudes, not their transfer.

2. **The transfer of servitudes is subject to other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - This factor talks about transfers and existing rights, which is not directly addressed by the query.

3. **The act establishing the servitude may provide otherwise, which can affect the transfer of servitudes.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query doesn't mention acts establishing servitudes or variations in their establishment affecting transfers.

4. **Servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - This is about transfer, which the query does not address.

5. **Servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) - The query talks about establishment conditions, not about making servitudes subjects of other rights.

Justifications align with the initial assessment that the query is more about the conditions for establishing a servitude rather than its transfer or how it interacts with other rights and lands post-establishment.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information, both the query's focus on the establishment of servitudes and the article's discussion on the transfer and characteristics of servitudes relate to the concept of servitudes in law. However, they address different aspects (establishment vs. transfer and rights).

- **(verdict No)** - The query and the article's verdicts do not directly apply to the same defendant or situation since one deals with establishment conditions and the other with transfer and existing rights conditions.

In conclusion:
- Task 1: The query is likely False, as servitudes are not strictly limited to neighboring lands.
- Task 2: The query does not entail any of the factors directly because it discusses establishment, while factors discuss transfers and interactions with other rights.
- Task 3: (verdict No), indicating the query and article's verdicts apply to different aspects or situations within the context of servitudes.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 717, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person.
2. The possessor of the structure has not exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage.
3. There is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees.
4. The owner of the structure has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, but the damage still occurred.
5. Another person is liable for the cause of the damage.

Verdict: If a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person, the possessor of that structure is liable to the person incurring damage to compensate for the damage; provided, however, that if the possessor has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, the owner must compensate for the damage.

3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justified verdict.

**Case 1:** 
(1, 2 | Y)
In this case, a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person (Factor 1), and the possessor of the structure has not exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage (Factor 2). According to Article 717, the possessor is liable for the damage. Therefore, the verdict is Yes (Y).

**Case 2:** 
(3, 4 | N)
In this case, there is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees (Factor 3), and the owner of the structure has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, but the damage still occurred (Factor 4). Although the owner took necessary care, they are not liable for the damage since it was caused by a defect in planting or supporting. However, according to Article 717, if the possessor has exercised necessary care, the owner must compensate for the damage. But here we consider the owner already took care hence verdict is No (N).

**Case 3:** 
(1, 5 | Y)
In this case, a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person (Factor 1), and another person is liable for the cause of the damage (Factor 5). According to Article 717, the possessor or owner may exercise their right to reimbursement against that other person. Therefore, the verdict is Yes (Y).

**Case 4:** 
(2, 3 | Y)
In this case, the possessor of the structure has not exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage (Factor 2), and there is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees (Factor 3). Since the possessor did not exercise necessary care, they are liable for the damage. According to Article 717, the provisions apply mutatis mutandis if there is a defect in planting or supporting. Therefore, the verdict is Yes (Y).

These cases demonstrate how different combinations of factors from Article 717 lead to various verdicts regarding liability and compensation for damages.

	•	(verdict Yes) if they refer to the same defendant.
	•	(verdict No) if they do not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Step 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning (Task 1)
The query states that if A, as the possessor of a structure, compensates for damages caused by a defect in the installation or preservation of the structure, then A may have a right to remedy against B, who shall be liable for the damages. According to the article, "The possessor or owner may exercise their right to reimbursement against another person who is liable for the cause of the damage." This implies that if A compensates for damages and B is liable for causing those damages, A indeed has a right to seek reimbursement from B. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query is True.

## Step 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor (Task 2)
1. A defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person.
➡ The query entails this factor because it mentions "any defect in the installation or preservation of any structure on land caused damages to others."

2. The possessor of the structure has not exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage.
➡ The query does not directly entail this factor, as it does not specify whether A exercised necessary care or not. However, it implies a situation where compensation is made, suggesting a focus on liability rather than the exercise of care.

3. There is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees.
➡ The query does not entail this factor because it discusses structures on land in general, without specifically mentioning bamboo or trees.

4. The owner of the structure has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, but the damage still occurred.
➡ Similar to factor 2, the query does not directly address the exercise of care by the possessor (A) or the conditions under which the damage occurred despite such care.

5. Another person is liable for the cause of the damage.
➡ The query entails this factor because it mentions "B who shall be liable for the damages," indicating another party's liability.

## Step 3: Verify alignment with Task 1 result
The analysis in Task 2 supports the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True, as it aligns with the article's provisions regarding liability and reimbursement rights.

## Step 4: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant (Task 3)
• (verdict Yes) The query and the article both refer to the possessor or owner of the structure being liable for damages and having the right to seek reimbursement from another liable party. Thus, they apply to the same defendant in terms of liability and rights.

The final answer is: $\boxed{True}$

article: (Order of Priority of Statutory Liens over Movables)
Article 330(1) If there are competing special statutory liens against the same movables, the order of priority follows the order set forth below. In this case, if there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables set forth in item (ii), a new preserver has priority over previous preservers:
(i) statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels and transportation;
(ii) statutory liens for the preservation of movables; and
(iii) statutory liens for the sale of movables, the supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor and industrial labor.
(2) In the cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, if a holder of a statutory lien ranked first knew at the time of acquiring the relevant claim of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank, that holder may not exercise the relevant rights of priority against those persons. The same applies to the exercise against persons that have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank.
(3) Regarding fruits, the first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor, the second rank belongs to persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, and the third rank belongs to lessors of land.

2. If there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers.

3. The holder of a statutory lien ranked first knew at the time of acquiring the relevant claim of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank.

4. A holder of a statutory lien may not exercise the relevant rights of priority against those persons who have a lower-ranked statutory lien if the holder knew about their existence at the time of acquiring the claim.

5. The same rule applies to the exercise against persons that have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank.

6. Regarding fruits, 
   - the first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor.
   - the second rank belongs to persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer.
   - the third rank belongs to lessors of land.

**Case 1:** 
A hotel owner has a statutory lien for lodging against a guest's movables. Meanwhile, there is also a statutory lien for preservation of movables by a third-party preserver who preserved the movables after the hotel owner's lien was established.
Justification: According to factor 2, if there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers. However, in this case, the hotel owner's lien (factor 1) takes precedence over the preservation lien. Since the hotel owner did not know about the third-party preserver at the time of acquiring their claim, they can exercise their rights of priority.
Output: (1, 2 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
A farmer supplies seeds and seedlings to a landowner for agricultural purposes. The landowner also has a statutory lien for leases of immovables against the same movables (fruits). The farmer knew about the landowner's lien at the time of acquiring their claim.
Justification: According to factor 6, regarding fruits, the first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor, but since there is no agricultural labor involved in this case, we look at factor 1. The landowner's lien for leases of immovables takes precedence over the farmer's supply of seeds and seedlings. However, because the farmer knew about the landowner's lien (factor 3), they cannot exercise their rights of priority against the landowner.
Output: (1, 3, 6 | N)

**Case 3:** 
An agricultural laborer works on a farm and has a statutory lien for agricultural labor against the fruits produced. There is also a lessor of land who has a statutory lien for leases of immovables against the same movables.
Justification: According to factor 6, regarding fruits, the first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor. Therefore, the agricultural laborer's lien takes precedence over the lessor's lien.
Output: (1, 6 | Y)

**Case 4:** 
A preserver preserves movables on behalf of a holder of a statutory lien ranked first for leases of immovables. Later, another preserver preserves the same movables, but the first preserver did not know about the second preserver at the time of preserving.
Justification: According to factor 2, if there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers. However, in this case, since the first preserver was acting on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien ranked first (factor 5), they can still exercise their rights of priority against the second preserver.
Output: (2, 5 | Y)

**Case 5:** 
A person engages in industrial labor and has a statutory lien for industrial labor against some movables. There is also another person who supplies seeds and seedlings or fertilizer and has a statutory lien for the sale of movables against the same movables.
Justification: According to factor 1, statutory liens for leases of immovables have the first rank, but since there are no such liens in this case, we look at the next ranks. The person who engages in industrial labor and the person who supplies seeds and seedlings or fertilizer both fall under the third rank (factor 1). However, according to factor 6 (regarding fruits), which is not directly applicable here since there are no fruits involved, but looking at the general principle of priority, we cannot determine a clear order between industrial labor and supply of seeds and seedlings. But given that both fall under the third rank without more specific guidance, it suggests an equal footing, thus potentially leading to a situation where neither can claim absolute priority over the other based on the ranks provided.
Output: (1 | N) 

Each case provides a unique combination of factors, and the justifications lead to determined verdicts. Note that these cases aim to cover various scenarios without duplicating factor combinations, keeping in mind the complexities and nuances of statutory lien priorities as outlined in the article.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that A may exercise the right of priority against B, where A has a statutory lien for leases of immovables and B has a statutory lien for agricultural labor. According to the article, statutory liens for leases of immovables have the first rank, while those for agricultural labor have the third rank. However, it is also stated that if the holder of a statutory lien ranked first knew at the time of acquiring the relevant claim of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank, they may not exercise their rights of priority against those persons.

Given this information, without explicit mention of A's knowledge about B's lien at the time of acquiring their claim, we cannot directly conclude the query is true based solely on the ranks. The outcome depends on whether A knew about B's statutory lien when A acquired their claim. Therefore, based on the provided rules alone and without additional context, the query could be seen as potentially false if A had such knowledge.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The order of priority of statutory liens over movables**: 
   ➡ The query entails this factor because it involves understanding the ranks of different types of statutory liens (A's lien for leases of immovables vs. B's lien for agricultural labor).

2. **If there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers**:
   The query does not directly entail this factor since it discusses liens related to leases and agricultural labor, not preservation of movables.

3. **The holder of a statutory lien ranked first knew at the time of acquiring the relevant claim of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank**:
   ➡ The query entails consideration of this factor because determining A's right to exercise priority over B depends on whether A was aware of B's (third-ranked) lien when A acquired their claim.

4. **A holder of a statutory lien may not exercise the relevant rights of priority against those persons who have a lower-ranked statutory lien if the holder knew about their existence at the time of acquiring the claim**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor as it directly relates to whether A can exercise priority over B, which would depend on A's knowledge of B's lien.

5. **The same rule applies to the exercise against persons that have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank**:
   The query does not entail this factor since it doesn't involve preservation of movables on behalf of another.

6. **Regarding fruits, the ranks belong to persons who engage in agricultural labor, supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, and lessors of land**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor indirectly because it involves a dispute over fruits (between A, a lessor, and B, someone involved in agricultural labor), although the primary focus is on the priority between leases of immovables and agricultural labor.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario and the article's general rule pertain to determining priority among different types of statutory liens over movables (including fruits from leased land), they indeed refer to scenarios involving the application of these rules, potentially to the same type of defendants (holders of statutory liens). However, the specific context of each verdict might differ based on the details of knowledge and timing of claim acquisition.

• (verdict Yes) if considering the general application to holders of statutory liens.
• (verdict No) if strictly interpreting "same defendant" as requiring identical scenarios or parties, which isn't explicitly stated but could be inferred in a broader legal context where specific cases are compared. Given the nature of the task and for clarity:
The final answer is: $\boxed{False}$

According to Article 636, the party cannot demand cure, reduction of remuneration, claim compensation, or cancel the contract if the non-conformity is due to the nature of the materials they provided.

### Case 2: Non-Conformity Due to Instructions Given
Factors: 1, 4 | Y  
Justification: Similar to Case 1, but here the non-conformity is a result of instructions given by the party ordering work. The article protects the contractor from liabilities arising from such instances.

### Case 3: Contractor's Knowledge and Failure to Notify
Factors: 1, 5, 6 | N  
Justification: Although the non-conformity occurred (Factor 1), if the contractor knew that the materials or instructions were inappropriate (Factor 5) but failed to notify the ordering party (Factor 6), Article 636 states an exception. In this case, the protections afforded to the contractor do not apply because they had knowledge of the issue and did not communicate it.

### Case 4: Non-Conformity Without Delivery Requirement
Factors: 2, 3 | Y  
Justification: This scenario involves a situation where delivery is not required (applying Factor 2), and the non-conformity regarding kind or quality at the completion of work is due to the materials provided by the party ordering work. The article's protection for the contractor applies in this case as well.

### Case 5: Non-Conformity Due to Both Materials and Instructions
Factors: 1, 3, 4 | Y  
Justification: Here, the non-conformity is caused by both the materials provided (Factor 3) and the instructions given (Factor 4) by the party ordering work. Since Article 636 does not differentiate between these causes in terms of liability protection for the contractor, the protections apply as long as there was no knowledge and failure to notify on the part of the contractor.

These cases demonstrate how different combinations of factors can lead to a determination of whether the defendant (contractor) is pledged to comply with the demands of the party ordering work under Article 636.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis into steps as requested.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that in cases where the defect in the subject matter of the work arises due to the instructions given by the party ordering the work, even if the contractor knew that the instructions were inappropriate but did not disclose the same, he/she does not have a warranty against defects. 

Given the information from Article 636, it's clear that if the contractor knows the materials or instructions are inappropriate and fails to notify the ordering party, the usual limitations on the ordering party's actions (demanding cure, reduction of remuneration, claiming compensation, or canceling the contract) do not apply. This implies that the contractor can be held responsible in such cases.

However, the query suggests a scenario where the defect arises from the instructions given by the ordering party, and the contractor knew these were inappropriate but did not disclose this. The article indicates that if the non-conformity is caused by any instructions the relevant party has given (factor 4), and the contractor knew these instructions were inappropriate but did not notify the ordering party (factors 5 and 6), then the usual exemptions from liability for the contractor do not apply.

Thus, logically, the query seems to align with the principles outlined in Article 636 regarding the contractor's responsibility when they are aware of inappropriate instructions but fail to inform the ordering party. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The contractor delivers to the party ordering work a content that does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind or quality.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor, as it focuses on defects arising from instructions given by the ordering party.)

2. **The subject matter of work does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind or quality when the work is finished (in cases where delivery is not required).**
   ➡ (query implies this situation indirectly by discussing defects in the subject matter due to instructions, but it doesn't directly address non-conformity in terms of kind or quality at completion.)

3. **The non-conformity is caused by the nature of the materials that the party ordering work has provided.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor, as it discusses defects arising from instructions, not materials provided by the ordering party.)

4. **The non-conformity is caused by any instructions that the relevant party has given.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor, as it specifically addresses defects arising due to the instructions given by the party ordering the work.)

5. **The contractor knew that the materials or instructions were inappropriate.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor, stating the contractor knew the instructions were inappropriate.)

6. **The contractor did not notify the ordering party of the inappropriateness of the materials or instructions.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor, indicating the contractor did not disclose the inappropriateness of the instructions.)

These justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True, as it accurately reflects scenarios where the contractor's knowledge and failure to disclose inappropriate instructions given by the ordering party affect their liability.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 636 discuss the contractor's responsibilities and liabilities in cases of non-conformity due to various factors, including inappropriate instructions from the ordering party, it is clear that:

• (verdict Yes), they refer to the same defendant, which is the contractor. The focus in both the article and the query is on the implications for the contractor when defects arise due to certain circumstances, particularly their awareness of and response to inappropriate instructions.

article: (Order of Priority of Statutory Liens over Movables)
Article 330(1) If there are competing special statutory liens against the same movables, the order of priority follows the order set forth below. In this case, if there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables set forth in item (ii), a new preserver has priority over previous preservers:
(i) statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels and transportation;
(ii) statutory liens for the preservation of movables; and
(iii) statutory liens for the sale of movables, the supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor and industrial labor.
(2) In the cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, if a holder of a statutory lien ranked first knew at the time of acquiring the relevant claim of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank, that holder may not exercise the relevant rights of priority against those persons. The same applies to the exercise against persons that have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank.
(3) Regarding fruits, the first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor, the second rank belongs to persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, and the third rank belongs to lessors of land.

 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order.
2. The order of priority includes three ranks: 
   - (i) statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels and transportation; 
   - (ii) statutory liens for the preservation of movables; and 
   - (iii) statutory liens for the sale of movables, the supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor and industrial labor.
3. If there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers.
4. The holder of a statutory lien ranked first may not exercise their rights of priority against holders of lower-ranked statutory liens if they knew about their existence at the time of acquiring the relevant claim.
5. The same restriction applies to the exercise of rights against persons who have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank.
6. Regarding fruits, the ranking is as follows: 
   - The first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor; 
   - The second rank belongs to persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer; and 
   - The third rank belongs to lessors of land.

Verdict: If there are competing special statutory liens against the same movables, the order of priority follows the specified ranks, with certain exceptions applying to holders of higher-ranked liens who knew about lower-ranked liens at the time of acquiring their claim.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 law cases with different combinations of factors.

**Case 1:** A hotel owner has a statutory lien for lodging against a guest's movables, and there is another statutory lien for preservation of movables by a third-party preserver. The hotel owner did not know about the existence of the third-party preserver at the time of acquiring the claim.
Justification: Factor 2 (i) takes priority over factor 2 (ii). Since the hotel owner did not know about the third-party preserver, they can exercise their rights of priority.
Output: (1, 2(i), 3 | Y)

**Case 2:** A farmer has a statutory lien for agricultural labor against a landowner's fruits, and there is another statutory lien for supply of seeds and seedlings by a supplier. The farmer engaged in the labor after the supplier had provided the seeds.
Justification: Factor 6 states that persons who engage in agricultural labor have first rank regarding fruits. Since the farmer engaged in the labor, they take priority over the supplier.
Output: (1, 2(iii), 6 | Y)

**Case 3:** A lessor of land has a statutory lien against a lessee's movables for non-payment of rent, and there is another statutory lien for sale of movables by a seller. The lessor knew about the existence of the seller's lien at the time of acquiring the claim.
Justification: Factor 4 states that the holder of a statutory lien ranked first may not exercise their rights of priority against holders of lower-ranked statutory liens if they knew about their existence. Since the lessor knew about the seller's lien, they cannot exercise their rights of priority.
Output: (1, 2(i), 2(iii), 4 | N)

**Case 4:** A preserver has a statutory lien for preservation of movables against a owner's movables, and there is another preserver who preserved the same movables later. The first preserver did not know about the existence of the second preserver.
Justification: Factor 3 states that a new preserver has priority over previous preservers. Since the second preserver preserved the movables later, they take priority over the first preserver.
Output: (1, 2(ii), 3 | Y)

**Case 5:** A supplier of fertilizer has a statutory lien against a farmer's fruits for non-payment, and there is another statutory lien for agricultural labor by a laborer. The supplier supplied the fertilizer before the laborer engaged in the labor.
Justification: Factor 6 states that persons who engage in agricultural labor have first rank regarding fruits, followed by suppliers of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer. Since the laborer engaged in the labor, they take priority over the supplier.
Output: (1, 2(iii), 6 | Y)

Note: The output format is (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y/N), where x, y,.. are the factor numbers and Y/N indicates whether the justification is correct to verdict.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "If B acquires a statutory lien for preservation of moveables on movable X, which is the subject of A's statutory lien for leases of immovables, by preserving X to the benefit of A, A may not exercise the right of priority against B."

From the provided factors:
- The order of priority for competing special statutory liens includes ranks such as leases of immovables and preservation of movables.
- A new preserver has priority over previous preservers in the case of statutory liens for preservation of movables (Factor 3).
- The holder of a statutory lien ranked first may not exercise their rights of priority against holders of lower-ranked statutory liens if they knew about their existence at the time of acquiring the relevant claim (Factor 4).

Given that B preserved X to the benefit of A, and considering Factor 5 which restricts the exercise of rights against persons who have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank, it implies that A (the holder of a higher-ranked lien) cannot exercise priority against B if B's preservation was done for A's benefit. This suggests that the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order.
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it involves competing liens between A and B on movable X, implying an understanding of priority orders.

2. The order of priority includes three ranks: 
   - (i) statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels and transportation; 
   - (ii) statutory liens for the preservation of movables; and 
   - (iii) statutory liens for the sale of movables, the supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor and industrial labor.
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as it specifically mentions A's lien for leases of immovables and B's lien for preservation of movables.

3. If there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers.
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor because it doesn't discuss multiple preservers but focuses on the relationship between A and B regarding their liens.

4. The holder of a statutory lien ranked first may not exercise their rights of priority against holders of lower-ranked statutory liens if they knew about their existence at the time of acquiring the relevant claim.
   ➡ (query entails this factor) since it implies that A, with a higher-ranked lien, cannot exercise priority over B under certain conditions.

5. The same restriction applies to the exercise of rights against persons who have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank.
   ➡ (query entails this factor) directly because B's preservation is for A's benefit, aligning with the scenario described in Factor 5.

6. Regarding fruits, the ranking is as follows: 
   - The first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor; 
   - The second rank belongs to persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer; and 
   - The third rank belongs to lessors of land.
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it discusses movable X without specifying the context of fruits or the listed activities.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is **True** based on the factors provided.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The article's verdict discusses competing special statutory liens against the same movables and their order of priority with certain exceptions.
- The query's verdict specifically addresses a situation where A (holder of a higher-ranked lien) may not exercise priority over B (who preserved movable X for A's benefit).

Both verdicts pertain to the application of statutory lien priorities in scenarios involving competing claims. However, they generalize different aspects of the law:
- The article’s verdict is broader, covering general principles of priority among various types of liens.
- The query’s verdict narrows down to a specific scenario where preservation for another's benefit affects priority.

Despite this difference, both apply to situations involving defendants or parties in legal disputes over statutory liens. Thus, considering the context provided:
• (verdict Yes) because they refer to principles that can be applied to the same type of defendant in cases involving competing statutory liens, although the query’s scenario is more specific.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 536, I will generate 4 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors.

**Case 1:**
The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party.
Justification: According to Article 536, if the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, the obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged to perform counter-performance.
Output: (1) | Y

**Case 2:**
The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, and the obligor benefits from being released from the obligation.
Justification: According to Article 536, if the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, the obligee may not refuse to complete counter-performance. Additionally, since the obligor benefits from being released from the obligation, the obligor must reimburse the obligee for the benefit. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to reimburse the obligee.
Output: (2, 3) | Y

**Case 3:**
The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee.
Justification: According to Article 536, if the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, the obligee may not refuse to complete counter-performance. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to perform counter-performance.
Output: (2) | Y

**Case 4:**
The obligor benefits from being released from the obligation, but there is no information about why the performance of the obligation became impossible.
Justification: According to Article 536, the fact that the obligor benefits from being released from the obligation is only relevant if the performance of the obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee. Since we do not have this information, we cannot conclude that the defendant is pledged to reimburse the obligee. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down each task in relation to the provided information.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query discusses a scenario where wine (the subject of sale) is specified only by type and is delivered to the buyer's domicile. If the buyer refuses acceptance but then loses the wine due to negligence, the query concludes that the buyer shall not be relieved of the obligation to pay for the purchase.

Given the principles outlined in Article 536, which focuses on the impossibility of performing an obligation and its implications on contractual obligations, we must consider whether the scenario described aligns with these principles. The key factor here is that the wine's loss is due to the buyer's negligence after the seller has fulfilled their primary obligation (delivering the wine to the buyer's domicile).

Based on general contractual principles, once the seller has performed their part of the contract (in this case, delivering the goods), the risk typically shifts to the buyer. If the buyer then loses the goods due to their own negligence, it would be logical that they remain responsible for payment, as they have benefited from or been responsible for the actions leading to the loss.

Therefore, considering general principles of contract law and the specifics of the scenario described, the query's conclusion seems **True**. The buyer's refusal to accept does not negate their responsibility if they subsequently lose the goods due to their own negligence after the seller has fulfilled their obligations.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor directly) - The scenario described involves the buyer's negligence, which is a ground attributable to one of the parties (the buyer), rather than an impossibility not attributable to either.

2. **The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor indirectly) - While the query focuses on the loss of goods after delivery, the initial refusal by the buyer could be seen as a ground attributable to the obligee (buyer), affecting the performance of the obligation.

3. **The obligor benefits from being released from the obligation.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - The query discusses the buyer's responsibility for payment despite losing the goods, which doesn't directly address the concept of benefiting from being released from an obligation. However, one could argue that if the buyer were relieved of payment, they would benefit from not having to pay for lost goods, but this is not the scenario's focus.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The article's verdicts seem to focus on the obligor (the party obligated to perform) and the obligee (the party entitled to receive performance), with conditions affecting who bears responsibility or benefits in cases of impossibility.
- The query specifically discusses the buyer's obligations and responsibilities, implying that the buyer is the defendant in this context.

Considering the scenarios described:
• **(verdict No)** - The article's verdicts are more broadly applicable and consider scenarios from both the obligor's and obligee's perspectives, depending on who is responsible for the impossibility. In contrast, the query specifically addresses a scenario where the buyer (and thus implicitly, the buyer as the defendant) has refused acceptance and then lost the goods due to negligence.

Therefore, while there might be some overlap in the principles applied, the specific focus of the article's verdicts and the query's verdict on different aspects of contractual obligation performance suggests they do not apply to the same defendant under the exact conditions described.

1. There is conflict among special statutory liens against the same immovables.
2. The order of priority follows the order set forth in the items of Article 325 when there is conflict among special statutory liens.
3. The same immovables are subject to successive sales.
4. The order of priority of the statutory liens for the sale of the immovables among sellers follows the chronological order of the sales.
5. A person has a claim arising from the preservation of immovables, which gives rise to a statutory lien over specific immovables of the obligor.
6. A person has a claim arising from construction work for immovables, which gives rise to a statutory lien over specific immovables of the obligor.
7. A person has a claim arising from the sale of immovables, which gives rise to a statutory lien over specific immovables of the obligor.

Verdict: If there is conflict among special statutory liens against the same immovables, the order of priority follows the order set forth in the items of Article 325, and if the same immovables are subject to successive sales, the order of priority of the statutory liens for the sale of the immovables among sellers follows the chronological order of the sales.

======== Generate Examples:
 I will generate 4 law cases based on the given factors.

**Case 1:** 
A construction company has a claim arising from construction work for immovables (Factor 6) and there is conflict among special statutory liens against the same immovables (Factor 1). 
Justification: Since there is conflict among special statutory liens, the order of priority follows the order set forth in Article 325. Construction work for immovables is listed as a cause for a statutory lien in Article 325. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.
Output: (1, 6 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
A seller has a claim arising from the sale of immovables (Factor 7) and the same immovables are subject to successive sales (Factor 3). 
Justification: Since the same immovables are subject to successive sales, the order of priority of the statutory liens for the sale of the immovables among sellers follows the chronological order of the sales. Therefore, the defendant is pledged if the seller's sale was earlier in the chronological order.
Output: (3, 7 | Y)

**Case 3:** 
A person has a claim arising from the preservation of immovables (Factor 5) but there is no conflict among special statutory liens against the same immovables (no Factor 1). 
Justification: Since there is no conflict among special statutory liens, Article 331 does not apply. However, Article 325 still grants a statutory lien for claims arising from the preservation of immovables. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.
Output: (5 | Y)

**Case 4:** 
There are no claims arising from the preservation of immovables, construction work for immovables, or the sale of immovables (no Factors 5, 6, or 7). 
Justification: Since there are no claims arising from the specified causes, there is no statutory lien. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: () | N)

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down each task based on the information provided.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the articles and the query:
- The articles outline rules for determining priority among special statutory liens, including those arising from preservation of immovables, construction work for immovables, and sale of immovables. 
- The query posits that in cases where there is conflict between statutory liens for preservation of immovable properties and statutory liens for construction work for immovable properties with respect to the same immovable properties, the order of priority shall be the same.

Based on the information provided:
- Article 325 sets forth an order of priority when there is conflict among special statutory liens.
- However, the specific details within Article 325 are not provided in the query or the breakdown, making it difficult to directly assess the truthfulness of the query without knowing how Article 325 prioritizes different types of liens.

Given this lack of specificity and assuming the articles follow standard legal principles where priority is often determined by the nature of the lien, the timing of its creation, or specific statutory rules:
- **The query seems to simplify the determination of priority between different types of liens (preservation vs. construction) without providing or referencing a clear rule from Article 325 that supports this simplification for these specific types of liens.**

Thus, based on logical reasoning and the information provided, **the query appears to be False** because it generalizes the order of priority without specifying how Article 325 addresses the conflict between preservation and construction liens.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **There is conflict among special statutory liens against the same immovables.**
   ➡ (query entails 1) - The query directly mentions a conflict between different types of statutory liens.

2. **The order of priority follows the order set forth in the items of Article 325 when there is conflict among special statutory liens.**
   ➡ The query does not explicitly mention following Article 325 for determining priority between preservation and construction liens; it implies a same-order priority without referencing the article's specifics.

3. **The same immovables are subject to successive sales.**
   - This factor is not directly addressed by the query, which focuses on conflicts between types of liens (preservation vs. construction) rather than sales.

4. **The order of priority of the statutory liens for the sale of the immovables among sellers follows the chronological order of the sales.**
   - The query does not address sales among sellers or their chronological order, focusing instead on preservation and construction liens.

5. **A person has a claim arising from the preservation of immovables, which gives rise to a statutory lien over specific immovables of the obligor.**
   ➡ (query entails 5) - The query mentions statutory liens for preservation of immovable properties.

6. **A person has a claim arising from construction work for immovables, which gives rise to a statutory lien over specific immovables of the obligor.**
   ➡ (query entails 6) - The query also mentions statutory liens for construction work for immovable properties.

7. **A person has a claim arising from the sale of immovables, which gives rise to a statutory lien over specific immovables of the obligor.**
   - This factor is not addressed by the query, which does not discuss sales as a source of liens in its scenario.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and the articles deal with determining priority among statutory liens for immovable properties, but without specific details on defendants:
- **The context suggests they could apply to the same general category of defendants (e.g., obligors or property owners), but the query focuses on a specific conflict between preservation and construction liens, while the article's verdict has broader applicability.**

However, since both are discussing scenarios involving immovable properties and statutory liens:
- **(verdict Yes)** - They refer to the same general legal context, even if the query narrows down to a specific type of conflict.

This conclusion assumes that "defendant" here refers to the category of individuals or entities involved in such legal disputes (e.g., property owners, contractors), rather than specific named parties in a lawsuit.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given factors from Article 300, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors, which is 4). Each case will assume that some of the factors happened and provide a justification for whether the defendants are pledged.

Here are the 4 law cases:

**Case 1:** 
Assuming only "The exercise of a right of retention" happened. The defendant exercised their right to retain a property but did not consider the prescription of claims.
Justification: Since the article states that the exercise of a right of retention does not preclude the running of extinctive prescription, it implies that other factors like "Does not preclude" and "The running of extinctive prescription" are also necessary for the verdict. Therefore, in this case, we cannot conclude if the defendants are pledged.
Output: (1 | N)

**Case 2:** 
Assuming "The exercise of a right of retention" and "Does not preclude" happened. The defendant exercised their right to retain a property, which did not prevent another process from occurring.
Justification: Given that these two factors occurred but without considering "The running of extinctive prescription" or "Of claims", we cannot directly apply the article's verdict as it specifically mentions the effect on the running of extinctive prescription of claims. Hence, we cannot determine if the defendants are pledged based solely on these factors.
Output: (1, 2 | N)

**Case 3:** 
Assuming "The exercise of a right of retention", "Does not preclude", and "Of claims" happened. The defendant exercised their right to retain a property which did not prevent another process related to claims from occurring.
Justification: This scenario still lacks the crucial factor "The running of extinctive prescription". Without it, we cannot conclude the impact on the defendants regarding being pledged according to Article 300.
Output: (1, 2, 4 | N)

**Case 4:** 
Assuming all factors happened: "The exercise of a right of retention", "Does not preclude", "The running of extinctive prescription", and "Of claims". The defendant exercised their right to retain a property, which did not prevent the running of extinctive prescription of claims.
Justification: Given that all conditions specified in Article 300 are met, we can directly apply its verdict. Therefore, the exercise of a right of retention does indeed not preclude the running of extinctive prescription of claims, meaning the defendants are pledged according to the article's stipulation.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The article states that "The exercise of a right of retention does not preclude the running of extinctive prescription of claims." This means that even if someone is exercising their right to retain something (because they have a claim against the owner, for example), this action does not stop the clock from ticking on how long they have to make a legal claim about it. The query, however, suggests that "The extinctive prescription of the claim secured by the right of retention does not run while the holder of the right of retention exercises the right of retention and retains the subject matter." This seems to directly contradict the article's statement because it implies that exercising the right of retention does indeed stop the clock on the extinctive prescription (the process by which a claim becomes invalid due to time passing).

Based on logical reasoning, if we consider the article as the basis for understanding legal principles regarding rights of retention and extinctive prescription, then the query appears to be **False**. This is because it contradicts the principle outlined in the article that exercising a right of retention does not preclude (or stop) the running of extinctive prescription on claims.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The exercise of a right of retention**: 
   ➡ The query entails this factor because it specifically mentions "the holder of the right of retention exercises the right of retention," indicating that the scenario involves someone using their right to retain something, typically as leverage for a claim or debt owed to them.

2. **Does not preclude**:
   The query does not directly express this concept in the same manner as the article. Instead, it suggests a scenario where exercising the right of retention appears to have a preclusive effect on the running of extinctive prescription, which is opposite to what "does not preclude" would imply.

3. **The running of extinctive prescription**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor by mentioning "the extinctive prescription of the claim," showing that it considers how time affects the validity of a claim, which is what extinctive prescription is about.

4. **Of claims**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor as well since it talks about "the claim secured by the right of retention," directly referencing a claim (or legal demand) that someone might have.

Justification for these assessments aligns with the conclusion from Task 1, reinforcing that the query seems to misunderstand or misapply the principle stated in the article regarding how exercising a right of retention affects the timing of extinctive prescription on claims.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information provided, both the article's statement and the query pertain to the holder of a right of retention. However, they differ significantly in their conclusions about how exercising this right affects the extinctive prescription of claims. 

- The article suggests that exercising the right does not impact the timing of when claims can no longer be made due to time passing (extinctive prescription).
- The query posits that exercising the right does indeed stop the clock on extinctive prescription for the claim in question.

Since both are discussing the situation from the perspective of someone holding a right of retention, we can conclude:
• **(verdict Yes)**: They refer to the same defendant (the holder of the right of retention), even though their conclusions about the legal implications differ.

 Based on the given factors from Article 201, I will generate 4 law cases that meet the instructions.

**Case 1:**
Assuming factors 1 and 2 have occurred, where an action for maintenance of possession was filed during the obstruction, but the possessed thing has been damaged due to construction work.
Justification: Since factor 2 (the possessed thing has been damaged due to construction work) is met, according to the proviso in paragraph 1, the action may not be filed. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (<1>, <2> | N)

**Case 2:**
Assuming factors 3 and 5 have occurred, where one year has passed from the time when the construction was started, and an action for preservation of possession may be filed so long as the danger of obstruction exists.
Justification: Since factor 3 (one year has passed from the time when the construction was started) is met, and factor 5 allows for an action for preservation of possession to be filed, the defendant is pledged if the danger of obstruction still exists. Therefore, the verdict depends on the existence of the danger of obstruction.
Output: (<3>, <5> | Y)

**Case 3:**
Assuming factors 4 and 6 have occurred, where the construction has been completed, and the possessed thing is likely to be damaged by the construction work.
Justification: Since factor 4 (the construction has been completed) is met, according to the proviso in paragraph 1, the action may not be filed. Additionally, factor 6 applies mutatis mutandis, which means that if the possessed thing is likely to be damaged, the provisions of the proviso apply. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (<4>, <6> | N)

**Case 4:**
Assuming factors 1 and 7 have occurred, where an action for maintenance of possession was filed during the obstruction, and an action for recovery of possession must be filed within one year from the time when a possessor was forcibly dispossessed.
Justification: Since factor 1 (an action for maintenance of possession was filed during the obstruction) is met, and factor 7 provides a separate timeframe for filing an action for recovery of possession, the defendant is pledged if both conditions are met. Therefore, the verdict depends on whether the possessor was forcibly dispossessed within one year.
Output: (<1>, <7> | Y)

These cases demonstrate different combinations of factors from Article 201 and provide a justification for each verdict based on the given conditions.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined, let's break down each task step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the query "An action for recovery of possession must be brought within one year from the time when possession was unlawfully usurped," we need to assess its truth value in relation to the provided factors and verdict. 

The relevant factor here is factor 7, which states, "An action for recovery of possession must be filed within one year from the time when a possessor was forcibly dispossessed." The query essentially rephrases this condition by using the term "unlawfully usurped" instead of "forcibly dispossessed," but both convey the idea of possession being taken away illegally or by force. 

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and comparing it with factor 7, the query is **True** because it accurately reflects the timeframe for filing an action for recovery of possession as stated in factor 7.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

Let's evaluate each factor to see if the query expresses it:

1. An action for maintenance of possession must be filed during the obstruction or within one year after the obstruction stops.
➡ The query does not entail this factor because it specifically discusses recovery of possession, not maintenance.

2. The possessed thing has been damaged due to construction work.
➡ The query does not entail this factor as it focuses on the timing of filing an action for recovery of possession, not on damage caused by construction.

3. One year has passed from the time when the construction was started.
➡ The query does not entail this factor because it discusses the timeframe for recovering possession, not the duration since construction began.

4. The construction has been completed.
➡ The query does not entail this factor as it is about the timing of an action for recovery of possession and does not mention construction completion.

5. An action for preservation of possession may be filed so long as the danger of obstruction exists.
➡ The query does not entail this factor because it specifically talks about recovering possession, not preserving it.

6. The possessed thing is likely to be damaged by the construction work.
➡ The query does not entail this factor since it's concerned with the timing for filing an action for recovery of possession, not potential damage from construction.

7. An action for recovery of possession must be filed within one year from the time when a possessor was forcibly dispossessed.
➡ **The query entails this factor** because it essentially states the same condition using slightly different wording ("unlawfully usurped" instead of "forcibly dispossessed").

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is true based on its alignment with factor 7.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict discusses conditions under which actions for maintenance, preservation, or recovery of possession may be filed, including specific timeframes and scenarios. The query's verdict focuses on the timeframe for filing an action for recovery of possession after being unlawfully dispossessed. 

Since both the article's verdict and the query's verdict pertain to rules governing the filing of possession-related actions without specifying a particular defendant or indicating they apply to different parties, we can conclude that:

• **(verdict Yes)** They refer to the same type of legal situation and thus would apply to the same kind of defendant in the context of these legal proceedings.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze the given civil legal article context, let's break it down into key factors and identify the verdict based on Article 508.

1. **Claim Extinguished by Prescription**: The claim in question has been extinguished due to prescription.
2. **Eligibility for Set-Off Prior to Extinguishment**: Before being extinguished, the claim was eligible for set-off.
3. **Obligee's Right to Use the Claim for Set-Off**: The party (obligee) who is owed a debt or performance has the right to use a claim for set-off.

Verdict: If a claim extinguished by prescription was eligible for set-off prior to its extinguishment, the obligee may use that claim for the set-off.

1. For each law case, assume that some of the factors happened. Justify whether the defedant are pledged.
2. No cases have same set of factors. Case must give a determined verdict either Yes or No.
3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 508 and the given factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the number of factors). Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
(1, 2 | Y)
In this case, a claim extinguished by prescription (Factor 1) was eligible for set-off prior to its extinguishment (Factor 2). According to Article 508, since both conditions are met, the obligee may use that claim for the set-off. Therefore, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 2:** 
(1 | N)
In this case, only the claim extinguished by prescription (Factor 1) is present. There is no information about whether it was eligible for set-off prior to its extinguishment. Since Article 508 requires both conditions to be met, the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 3:** 
(2, 3 | Y)
In this case, the claim was eligible for set-off prior to its extinguishment (Factor 2), and the obligee has the right to use a claim for set-off (Factor 3). Although the claim's extinction by prescription is not mentioned, Article 508 implies that if a claim is eligible for set-off, it can be used. Therefore, assuming the claim was extinguished, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 4:** 
(3 | N)
In this case, only the obligee's right to use a claim for set-off (Factor 3) is present. Without information about the claim being extinguished by prescription and its eligibility for set-off prior to extinction, Article 508 cannot be applied directly. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

These cases provide different combinations of factors and their corresponding verdicts based on Article 508.

Task Definition:

Task 1:

Given a set of articles, determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Task 2:

Given the query and a list of factors, assess whether the query expresses each factor. The query expresses a factor if it considers evidence within a similar situation or scenario as the factor. Justify your reasoning for all factors. Then, verify whether your justifications align with the result from Task 1.

Output format:
If the query entails a factor X, present it in the following format:

Task 3:

Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant. Represent the result as:
	•	(verdict Yes) if they refer to the same defendant.
	•	(verdict No) if they do not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that A may assert against B a set-off after Claim X has been extinguished due to prescription, given that both claims were eligible for set-off before the extinction of Claim X. According to the article's verdict, if a claim extinguished by prescription was eligible for set-off prior to its extinguishment, the obligee may use that claim for the set-off. Therefore, logically, the query is True because it aligns with the principle outlined in the article.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Claim Extinguished by Prescription**: 
➡ The query entails Claim Extinguished by Prescription, as it specifically mentions that "Claim X has been extinguished due to prescription."

2. **Eligibility for Set-Off Prior to Extinguishment**:
➡ The query entails Eligibility for Set-Off Prior to Extinguishment because it states that both claims "have become eligible for set-off" before Claim X was extinguished.

3. **Obligee's Right to Use the Claim for Set-Off**:
➡ The query entails Obligee's Right to Use the Claim for Set-Off, as it describes a scenario where A (the obligee of Claim Y) asserts a set-off against B after Claim X's extinction, implying the use of Claim X for set-off despite its extinguishment.

These justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is True based on the given factors and article's verdict.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and the article discuss scenarios where a claim extinguished by prescription can still be used for set-off, they essentially refer to the same legal principle applying to any defendant in such a situation. Therefore, the verdicts about using an extinguished claim for set-off purposes would apply to the same type of defendant (any party owed a debt or performance), which in this context is A in the query and the obligee in the article.

• (verdict Yes) 

The final answer is: $\boxed{True}$

article: (Attachment of Claim Subject to Manifestation of Intention to Restrict Assignment)
Article 466-4(1) The provisions of Article 466, paragraph (3) do not apply to an attaching obligee that has enforced compulsory execution against a claim that is subject to the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
(2)Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, if a third party such as the assignee knew or did not know due to gross negligence that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment was made, and the obligee of the assignee or other third party enforces compulsory execution against the claim referred to in that paragraph, the obligor may refuse to perform the obligation and duly assert against an attaching obligee any event that results in extinguishing the obligation such as payment to the assignor.
(Assignability of Claims)
Article 466(1) A claim may be assigned; provided, however, that this does not apply if its nature does not permit the assignment.
(2) Even if a party to a claim manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim (hereinafter referred to as the "manifestation of intention to restrict assignment"), the validity of the assignment of the claim is not impaired.
(3) In the case prescribed in the preceding paragraph, the obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party such as the assignee that knew or did not know due to gross negligence that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment was made, and may duly assert against such third party any event that results in extinguishment of the obligation such as payment to the assignor.
(4) The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the obligor does not perform the obligation, and the third party prescribed in that paragraph makes a demand to the obligor for the performance to the assignor by specifying a reasonable period of time, but the obligor does not perform the obligation within that period.
query: A special agreement to restrict assignment made by the parties with respect to a claim for deposits may not be duly asserted against an attaching obligee that has commenced compulsory execution against such claim, even if the obligee knew, or did not know due to gross negligence, of the existence of such special agreement.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The provisions of Article 466, paragraph (3) do not apply to an attaching obligee that has enforced compulsory execution against a claim that is subject to the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
2. A claim may be assigned, provided that its nature does not permit the assignment.
3. A party to a claim may manifest the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim, referred to as the "manifestation of intention to restrict assignment".
4. The validity of the assignment of a claim is not impaired even if a party manifests the intention to restrict assignment.
5. An obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party, such as an assignee, that knew or did not know due to gross negligence that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment was made.
6. The obligor may duly assert against a third party any event that results in extinguishment of the obligation, such as payment to the assignor.
7. A third party, such as an assignee, may have knowledge or grossly negligent lack of knowledge about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
8. Compulsory execution may be enforced by an obligee of the assignee or another third party against a claim subject to the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
9. The obligor's refusal to perform the obligation is contingent upon the third party's knowledge or grossly negligent lack of knowledge about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
10. A demand for performance may be made by a third party to the obligor, specifying a reasonable period of time, in cases where the obligor does not perform the obligation.

Verdict: The provisions of Article 466, paragraph (3) do not apply to an attaching obligee that has enforced compulsory execution against a claim subject to the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment, but the obligor may refuse to perform the obligation and assert events resulting in extinguishment of the obligation if certain conditions are met.

======== Generate Examples:
 I will generate 5 law cases based on the provided factors.

**Case 1:**
(<factor 2>, <factor 3>, <factor 4> | Y)
Justification: The claim can be assigned (factor 2), and a party to the claim has manifested the intention to restrict assignment (factor 3). However, the validity of the assignment is not impaired (factor 4). Since the obligor's refusal to perform the obligation is not mentioned, we assume that the defendant is pledged to perform the obligation. Verdict: Yes

**Case 2:**
(<factor 1>, <factor 5>, <factor 7> | N)
Justification: The provisions of Article 466, paragraph (3) do not apply to an attaching obligee (factor 1), and the obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party that knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment (factor 5). Additionally, the third party has knowledge or grossly negligent lack of knowledge about the manifestation (factor 7). Given these conditions, the defendant is not pledged to perform the obligation. Verdict: No

**Case 3:**
(<factor 6>, <factor 8>, <factor 9> | Y)
Justification: The obligor may assert against a third party any event that results in extinguishment of the obligation (factor 6), and compulsory execution may be enforced by an obligee of the assignee or another third party against a claim subject to the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment (factor 8). Furthermore, the obligor's refusal to perform the obligation is contingent upon the third party's knowledge or grossly negligent lack of knowledge about the manifestation (factor 9). Since these conditions are met, the defendant is pledged to perform the obligation. Verdict: Yes

**Case 4:**
(<factor 3>, <factor 4>, <factor 10> | N)
Justification: A party to the claim has manifested the intention to restrict assignment (factor 3), but the validity of the assignment is not impaired (factor 4). Additionally, a demand for performance may be made by a third party to the obligor, specifying a reasonable period of time (factor 10). Given that the obligor's refusal to perform the obligation is not mentioned, and a demand for performance can be made, we assume that the defendant is not pledged to perform the obligation. Verdict: No

**Case 5:**
(<factor 1>, <factor 2>, <factor 6> | Y)
Justification: The provisions of Article 466, paragraph (3) do not apply to an attaching obligee (factor 1), and a claim may be assigned (factor 2). Furthermore, the obligor may assert against a third party any event that results in extinguishment of the obligation (factor 6). Since these conditions are met, we assume that the defendant is pledged to perform the obligation. Verdict: Yes

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a special agreement to restrict assignment made by the parties with respect to a claim for deposits may not be duly asserted against an attaching obligee that has commenced compulsory execution against such claim, even if the obligee knew, or did not know due to gross negligence, of the existence of such special agreement. Based on the factors provided, specifically factor 1 and factor 8, it can be inferred that compulsory execution by an attaching obligee against a claim subject to manifestation of intention to restrict assignment is addressed in the article. However, the article's focus on the provisions of Article 466, paragraph (3) not applying to such an attaching obligee suggests that there are specific circumstances under which restrictions may or may not be asserted against certain parties involved in compulsory execution. Given this context and considering factor 1, it can be reasoned that the query is likely False because the article implies that certain provisions do apply differently based on the status of the obligee and their actions regarding compulsory execution.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning for all factors.

1. The provisions of Article 466, paragraph (3) do not apply to an attaching obligee that has enforced compulsory execution against a claim that is subject to the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
➡ (query entails 1) - The query discusses a scenario where an attaching obligee has commenced compulsory execution, which aligns with this factor.

2. A claim may be assigned, provided that its nature does not permit the assignment.
➡ (query does not entail 2) - The query focuses on restrictions to assignment and their assertion against an attaching obligee, rather than the assignability of claims based on their nature.

3. A party to a claim may manifest the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim, referred to as the "manifestation of intention to restrict assignment".
➡ (query entails 3) - The query mentions a special agreement to restrict assignment, which is akin to manifesting an intention to restrict assignment.

4. The validity of the assignment of a claim is not impaired even if a party manifests the intention to restrict assignment.
➡ (query does not entail 4) - The query's concern is with asserting restrictions against an attaching obligee, not with the validity of assignments despite such restrictions.

5. An obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party, such as an assignee, that knew or did not know due to gross negligence that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment was made.
➡ (query entails 5) - The query touches on the idea of knowledge or lack thereof regarding restrictions, which is relevant to an obligor's refusal to perform.

6. The obligor may duly assert against a third party any event that results in extinguishment of the obligation, such as payment to the assignor.
➡ (query does not entail 6) - While the query discusses assertion of rights, it specifically mentions asserting restrictions against an attaching obligee, not events leading to obligation extinguishment.

7. A third party, such as an assignee, may have knowledge or grossly negligent lack of knowledge about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
➡ (query entails 7) - The query explicitly mentions knowledge or gross negligence regarding a special agreement to restrict assignment.

8. Compulsory execution may be enforced by an obligee of the assignee or another third party against a claim subject to the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
➡ (query entails 8) - The scenario involves compulsory execution by an attaching obligee, aligning with this factor.

9. The obligor's refusal to perform the obligation is contingent upon the third party's knowledge or grossly negligent lack of knowledge about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
➡ (query does not entail 9) - While related to knowledge and assertion of rights, the query does not directly address the conditions under which an obligor may refuse performance based on a third party's knowledge.

10. A demand for performance may be made by a third party to the obligor, specifying a reasonable period of time, in cases where the obligor does not perform the obligation.
➡ (query does not entail 10) - The query does not discuss demands for performance or specify periods of time for such demands.

Justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is likely False because it touches on aspects related to compulsory execution and assertion of restrictions but does so in a manner that suggests specific exceptions or conditions under which certain actions can be taken, reflecting the complexity of applying article provisions to real scenarios.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict discusses an attaching obligee that has enforced compulsory execution against a claim subject to manifestation of intention to restrict assignment. The query also concerns an attaching obligee but focuses on the assertion of special agreements to restrict assignment against such an obligee in the context of compulsory execution. Given this, both verdicts apply to scenarios involving an attaching obligee.

• (verdict Yes) - Both the query's and article's verdicts refer to the same type of defendant, namely an attaching obligee involved in compulsory execution.

According to the provided factors and verdicts, a person who has intentionally or negligently infringed the rights of another is liable to compensate, unless they are a minor without sufficient intellectual capacity. This implies that minors can be liable under certain circumstances, contradicting the query's absolute statement about minors never being liable.

## Step 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.
➡ The query entails "A person has intentionally or negligently infringed the rights or legally protected interests of another person" because it discusses a minor inflicting damage, implying an infringement of rights.
➡ The query entails "The infringement results in damage to another person" as it mentions damage inflicted by the minor.
➡ The query does not directly entail "The damage includes loss or damage other than of property" since it doesn't specify the type of damage.
➡ The query does not directly entail "The infringement affects the body, liberty, or reputation of another person" or "The infringement affects the property rights of another person" as it doesn't specify how the damage was inflicted or what kind of rights were affected.
➡ The query entails "The person infringing is a minor" since it specifically mentions a minor inflicting damage.
➡ The query does not directly entail "The minor did not have sufficient intellectual capacity to appreciate their own liability for the act" because it makes a general statement about minors never being liable, without considering intellectual capacity.

## Step 3: Verify if the justifications align with the result from Task 1.
Given that the query's absolute statement about minors never being liable contradicts the nuanced stance in the articles (which suggests minors can be liable unless they lack sufficient intellectual capacity), and considering how the query entails some factors but not others, it supports the conclusion from Task 1.

## Step 4: Determine if the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.
Given that the query discusses minors and their liability (or lack thereof) in a way that contradicts the nuanced approach of the articles, which consider both the age and intellectual capacity of the minor, it suggests they do not refer to the same conditions under which a defendant is considered liable. Therefore, the verdicts apply to the situation differently based on the factors considered.

The final answer is: $\boxed{False}$

======== Generate Examples:
 I will generate 5 law cases based on the given factors.

**Case 1:**
The defendant, a person with limited capacity, entered into a contract through their legal representative. The contract was voidable due to the defendant's qualified legal capacity to act. The defendant's legal representative is seeking to rescind the contract.
Justification: According to Article 120(1), an act that is voidable on the grounds of qualified legal capacity to act may be rescinded only by the person with qualified legal capacity, including their legal representative. Therefore, the defendant's legal representative has the authority to rescind the contract.
Output: (Factor 1, Factor 3) | Y

**Case 2:**
The plaintiff and the defendant entered into a contract, but the plaintiff later discovered that they had made a mistake in understanding the terms of the contract. The plaintiff is seeking to rescind the contract due to mistake.
Justification: According to Article 120(2), an act that is voidable on the grounds of mistake may be rescinded only by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or their agent or successor. Since the plaintiff made the defective manifestation of intention, they have the right to rescind the contract.
Output: (Factor 5) | Y

**Case 3:**
The defendant was a victim of fraud and entered into a contract under duress. The defendant is seeking to rescind the contract due to fraud and duress.
Justification: According to Article 120(2), an act that is voidable on the grounds of mistake, fraud, or duress may be rescinded only by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or their agent or successor. Since the defendant was the victim of fraud and duress, they have the right to rescind the contract.
Output: (Factor 6) | Y

**Case 4:**
The plaintiff is seeking to rescind a contract on behalf of their principal, who has limited capacity and was represented by a legal representative in entering into the contract. However, the plaintiff does not have the authority to give consent to the rescission.
Justification: According to Article 120(1), an act that is voidable on the grounds of qualified legal capacity to act may be rescinded only by the person with qualified legal capacity, including their legal representative or a person who has the authority to give consent thereto. Since the plaintiff does not have the authority to give consent, they cannot rescind the contract.
Output: (Factor 1, Factor 4) | N

**Case 5:**
The defendant, a person with qualified legal capacity, entered into a contract and later discovered that their legal representative had made a mistake in understanding the terms of the contract. The defendant's legal representative is seeking to rescind the contract due to mistake.
Justification: According to Article 120(2), an act that is voidable on the grounds of mistake may be rescinded only by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or their agent or successor. Since the defendant's legal representative did not make the defective manifestation of intention, they do not have the right to rescind the contract.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query suggests that if an act can be rescinded by a person (A) who made the defective manifestation of intention due to A's mistake, then the act is also voidable by the counterparty (B). According to the information provided from Article 120, an act voidable on the grounds of mistake, fraud, or duress may be rescinded only by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or an agent or successor thereof. There is no direct indication that the counterparty (B) has the right to rescind the act based solely on A's mistake. Therefore, based on the information provided, the query seems to be False.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **An act being voidable on the grounds of qualified legal capacity to act is a relevant factor.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) because it specifically mentions mistake as the ground for voidability, not qualified legal capacity to act.

2. **The person with qualified legal capacity to act must be involved in the rescission process.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) since it discusses the scenario of a defective manifestation due to mistake, not issues related to qualified legal capacity to act.

3. **An agent or successor of the person with qualified legal capacity to act may also be involved in the rescission process.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) as it focuses on the person who made the defective manifestation and their counterpart, without mentioning agents or successors in this context.

4. **A person who has the authority to give consent to the rescission is another relevant factor.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) because it doesn't discuss the role of consent in the rescission process by a counterparty.

5. **An act being voidable on the grounds of mistake, fraud, or duress is a separate relevant factor.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) since it specifically mentions "mistake" as a ground for the defective manifestation of intention.

6. **The person who made the defective manifestation of intention must be involved in the rescission process.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as it talks about the person (A) who made the defective manifestation due to mistake.

7. **An agent or successor thereof may also be involved in the rescission process.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) since it doesn't explicitly mention agents or successors of the person who made the defective manifestation, though it implies a direct action by the counterparty.

The justifications provided align with the initial assessment that the query is False because it incorrectly assumes the counterparty's right to rescind based on the other party's mistake without clear support from the outlined factors.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

• (verdict No) The query suggests that both the person who made the defective manifestation (A) and the counterparty (B) have a role in rescinding the act, which seems to imply different defendants or parties involved in the rescission process. In contrast, the article's verdict clearly outlines specific individuals who can rescind an act based on its voidability grounds, focusing on the person who made the defective manifestation or their agents/successors, without directly addressing counterparty rights in this context. Thus, the query and the article's verdict do not apply to the same defendant in the manner suggested by the query.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case will assume a different combination of factors and provide a justified verdict.

**Case 1:**
Assuming **Contract Composition (1)** and **Cancellation Requirement (2)** occurred. A contract was formed between two parties, where one party consisted of three persons (A, B, and C). The contract was canceled by all three persons (A, B, and C).
Output: (1, 2) | Y
Justification: Since the contract composition consisted of multiple persons and the cancellation requirement was met by all persons, the defendant is pledged to the verdict.

**Case 2:**
Assuming **Right to Cancel Extinguishment Condition (3)** occurred. The right to cancel was extinguished with respect to one person (A) who was part of a party consisting of two persons (A and B).
Output: (3) | N
Justification: Although the right to cancel was extinguished for one person, it is unclear whether the cancellation requirement was met or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the defendant is pledged.

**Case 3:**
Assuming **Cancellation Requirement (2)** and **Consequence of Extinguishment (4)** occurred. A contract was canceled by all persons (A, B, and C) who constituted one party. Later, it was discovered that the right to cancel had been extinguished with respect to one person (A).
Output: (2, 4) | Y
Justification: Since the cancellation requirement was met initially and the consequence of extinguishment applies, the defendant is pledged to the verdict.

**Case 4:**
Assuming **Contract Composition (1)** and **Right to Cancel Extinguishment Condition (3)** occurred. A contract was formed between two parties, where one party consisted of two persons (A and B). The right to cancel was extinguished with respect to one person (A).
Output: (1, 3) | N
Justification: Although the contract composition consisted of multiple persons and the right to cancel was extinguished for one person, it is unclear whether the cancellation requirement was met or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the defendant is pledged.

These cases provide a range of scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors and a justified verdict.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the context of Article 544, which discusses the indivisible nature of the right to cancel in contracts involving multiple parties, we can apply this principle to the scenario described in the query. The query states that if a lessee dies and several heirs jointly succeed to the right of lease, the lessor must make a manifestation of an intention to cancel it to all of the heirs to cancel the lease contract.

Logically, this aligns with the principles outlined in Article 544 because:
- The contract composition involves multiple parties (the heirs).
- The cancellation requirement is that it may be effected only by, or against, all those persons.
- If the right to cancel is extinguished with respect to one person, it is also extinguished with respect to the other persons.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the principles of Article 544, the query is **True**. The lessor must indeed make a manifestation of an intention to cancel to all of the heirs to effectively cancel the lease contract.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Contract Composition**: The query involves a situation where several heirs jointly succeed to the right of lease, indicating a contract composition of multiple parties.
   ➡ (query entails Contract Composition)

2. **Cancellation Requirement**: The query states that the lessor must make a manifestation of an intention to cancel to all of the heirs, aligning with the requirement that cancellation may be effected only by, or against, all those persons.
   ➡ (query entails Cancellation Requirement)

3. **Right to Cancel Extinguishment Condition**: While not directly addressed in the query's scenario, the principle implied is that if the right to cancel were extinguished for one heir, it would likely affect the others due to their joint succession, though this is more about the consequence than the condition itself.
   ➡ (query entails Right to Cancel Extinguishment Condition indirectly)

4. **Consequence of Extinguishment**: The query does not explicitly address what happens if the right to cancel is extinguished for one heir, but based on Article 544, we can infer it would also be extinguished for the others.
   ➡ (query entails Consequence of Extinguishment indirectly)

The justifications provided align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query's scenario and requirements are consistent with the principles outlined in Article 544.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 544 deal with the indivisible nature of contracts involving multiple parties (in this case, heirs succeeding to a lease), and considering the necessity for all parties to be involved in the cancellation process:
• **(verdict Yes)**, they refer to the same general principle regarding defendants or parties in a contract. The query specifically applies this principle to a scenario involving heirs and a lessor, indicating that the verdicts indeed pertain to the same legal concept concerning multiple-party contracts.

   - The term "performer" refers to the individual or entity required to perform an action (in this context, likely related to making a deposit).
   - The term "obligee" refers to the party to whom the performance is due.

2. The performer's inability to ascertain the obligee must not be due to their own negligence.
   - **Negligence on the part of the performer** in ascertaining the obligee's identity is a significant factor.
   - If the performer is negligent, the provision does not apply.

**Case 1:** 
The performer was unable to ascertain the obligee due to a lack of information provided by the client. However, it was determined that the performer had taken reasonable steps to identify the obligee and was not negligent in their efforts.
Justification: Since the performer's inability to ascertain the obligee was not due to their own negligence, the preceding paragraph applies, and the defendant is pledged.
Output: (1 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
The performer failed to conduct a thorough search for the obligee, which led to their inability to ascertain the obligee's identity. It was found that the performer had been negligent in their efforts to identify the obligee.
Justification: As the performer was negligent in ascertaining the obligee, the provision does not apply, and the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (2 | N)

**Case 3:** 
The performer's inability to ascertain the obligee was due to circumstances beyond their control, such as a natural disaster destroying relevant documents. The performer had taken all reasonable steps to identify the obligee before the disaster occurred.
Justification: Given that the performer's inability to ascertain the obligee was not due to their own negligence and they had taken reasonable steps, the preceding paragraph applies, and the defendant is pledged.

 ### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False

Based on the information provided in Article 494(2), the query states that if a performer is unable to ascertain the obligee without negligence, the performer may deposit the subject matter of the performance with an official depository. This aligns with the conditions outlined in the article: the inability to identify the obligee not being due to the performer's own negligence allows for such a deposit. Therefore, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The inability to identify the obligee**: 
➡ (query entails the inability to identify the obligee)  
   The query directly mentions the performer's inability to ascertain the obligee, which is a primary condition for applying the provision.

2. **Negligence on the part of the performer**:
➡ (query entails negligence on the part of the performer)  
   The query specifies that the performer's inability to ascertain the obligee must be "without negligence," implying that negligence would alter the outcome, thus considering this factor.

Justifications for both factors align with the logical reasoning provided in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is **True**.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query’s Verdict and the Article’s Verdict Apply to the Same Defendant

Given the information, both the query's verdict and the article's verdict pertain to the conditions under which a performer can deposit the subject matter of a performance when they cannot ascertain the obligee. These conditions specifically address the scenario where the performer is not negligent in their inability to identify the obligee. Since these apply to the same set of circumstances and are directed towards the same party (the performer) in similar situations, it indicates that both verdicts refer to the **same defendant**.

 After carefully reading Article 650, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

* The mandatary has expended costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business.
* The costs were expended by the mandatary for the administration of the mandated business.
* The mandatary has borne any obligation found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business.
* The obligation was borne by the mandatary for the administration of the mandated business.
* The obligation has not yet fallen due.
* The mandatary incurs loss or damage in order to administer the mandated business.
* The loss or damage incurred by the mandatary is not due to the negligence of the mandatary.

Verdict: The mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator and any interest on the same from the day the costs were expended.
Verdict: The mandatary may demand that the mandator perform the obligation on the mandatary's behalf.
Verdict: The mandatary may require the mandator to tender reasonable security if the obligation has not yet fallen due.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 650, I will generate 5 law cases with unique combinations of factors. Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
The mandatary has expended costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business (Factor 1) and the costs were expended by the mandatary for the administration of the mandated business (Factor 2).
Justification: The mandatary is entitled to reimbursement of costs under Article 650(1). Therefore, the defendant (mandator) is pledged to reimburse the mandatary.
Output: (1, 2 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
The mandatary has borne any obligation found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business (Factor 3), but the obligation has not yet fallen due (Factor 5).
Justification: Although the mandatary has borne an obligation, it has not yet fallen due. According to Article 650(2), the mandatary may require the mandator to tender reasonable security in such cases. Therefore, the defendant (mandator) is pledged to provide reasonable security.
Output: (3, 5 | Y)

**Case 3:** 
The mandatary incurs loss or damage in order to administer the mandated business (Factor 6), but the loss or damage incurred by the mandatary is due to the negligence of the mandatary (not Factor 7).
Justification: Article 650(3) states that the mandatary may claim compensation for loss or damage not due to their own negligence. Since the loss or damage was caused by the mandatary's negligence, they are not entitled to compensation. Therefore, the defendant (mandator) is not pledged.
Output: (6 | N)

**Case 4:** 
The mandatary has expended costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business (Factor 1), and the mandatary incurs loss or damage in order to administer the mandated business (Factor 6), and the loss or damage incurred by the mandatary is not due to the negligence of the mandatary (Factor 7).
Justification: The mandatary is entitled to reimbursement of costs under Article 650(1) and compensation for loss or damage under Article 650(3). Therefore, the defendant (mandator) is pledged to reimburse the costs and provide compensation.
Output: (1, 6, 7 | Y)

**Case 5:** 
The mandatary has borne any obligation found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business (Factor 3), and the obligation was borne by the mandatary for the administration of the mandated business (Factor 4).
Justification: According to Article 650(2), the mandatary may demand that the mandator perform the obligation on the mandatary's behalf. Therefore, the defendant (mandator) is pledged to perform the obligation.
Output: (3, 4 | Y)

Note that each case has a unique combination of factors, and the justification leads to a determined verdict of either "Y" (Yes, the defendant is pledged) or "N" (No, the defendant is not pledged).

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "If the mandatary has incurred costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business, the mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandatory and any interest on the same from the day the costs were incurred."

Based on the information provided in Article 650, the statement seems to align with the verdict that "The mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator and any interest on the same from the day the costs were expended." The key difference is the term "mandatory" versus "mandator" and "incurred" versus "expended," but contextually, they appear to refer to the same roles and actions. Therefore, logically, the query seems True, assuming "mandatory" is a typographical error for "mandator" and considering the semantic similarity between "incurred" and "expended."

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The mandatary has expended costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it mentions incurring costs necessary for the administration, which aligns with expending costs for the same purpose.

2. **The costs were expended by the mandatary for the administration of the mandated business.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as it specifies that the costs are for the administration of the mandated business.

3. **The mandatary has borne any obligation found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business.**
   ❌ (query does not entail this factor) because it only talks about incurring costs, not bearing obligations.

4. **The obligation was borne by the mandatary for the administration of the mandated business.**
   ❌ (query does not entail this factor) for the same reason as above; it doesn't mention obligations.

5. **The obligation has not yet fallen due.**
   ❌ (query does not entail this factor) since it doesn't discuss the timing of obligations falling due, likely because it focuses on costs rather than obligations.

6. **The mandatary incurs loss or damage in order to administer the mandated business.**
   ❌ (query does not entail this factor) as it specifically mentions incurring costs, not loss or damage.

7. **The loss or damage incurred by the mandatary is not due to the negligence of the mandatary.**
   ❌ (query does not entail this factor) because it doesn't address the cause of any losses or damages, focusing instead on costs.

These justifications support the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is essentially True in the context provided, despite some factors not being directly addressed.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The query refers to claiming reimbursement from the "mandatory."
- Article 650's relevant verdicts refer to actions against the "mandator."

Assuming a typographical error where "mandatory" should be "mandator," both the query and the article's verdicts would apply to the same defendant, which is the mandator.

• (verdict Yes) 

This conclusion aligns with the logical reasoning provided in Task 1, considering the apparent typographical error.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors from Article 388, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** (1, 2 | N)
In this case, the land and building belong to the same owner (Factor 1), and a mortgage is created with respect to that land or building (Factor 2). However, there is no enforcement of the mortgage, and the ownership of the land and building remains the same. Since Factor 3 (enforcement of the mortgage causing different owners) is not met, it cannot be deemed that a superficies has been created.

**Case 2:** (1, 3 | Y)
In this case, the land and building initially belong to the same owner (Factor 1), but due to the enforcement of a mortgage, they now belong to different owners (Factor 3). Although no mortgage was explicitly created (Factor 2 is missing), the change in ownership meets the condition for a superficies to be deemed created.

**Case 3:** (2, 4 | N)
In this case, a mortgage is created with respect to the land or building (Factor 2), and the parties request the court to fix the rent (Factor 4). However, there is no indication that the land and building initially belonged to the same owner (Factor 1) or that the enforcement of the mortgage caused them to belong to different owners (Factor 3). Without these conditions, a superficies cannot be deemed created.

**Case 4:** (1, 2, 3 | Y)
In this case, all conditions are met: the land and building belong to the same owner (Factor 1), a mortgage is created with respect to that land or building (Factor 2), and the enforcement of that mortgage causes them to belong to different owners (Factor 3). Since all necessary factors are present, it can be deemed that a superficies has been created with respect to that building.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the information from Article 388 and the scenario described in the query, we need to assess if the creation of a statutory superficies with respect to the building on the land occurs when the building's owner (Person A) and the land's owner (also Person A initially) become different due to a mortgage execution that results in Person C becoming the new landowner.

- The initial condition is that both the land and the building belong to Person A.
- A joint mortgage for both the land and the building is created with respect to Person B.
- Upon execution of the mortgage, only the land's ownership changes to Person C, while the building's ownership remains with Person A (as the query implies the building was built on the land by Person A).

Based on Article 388, when a mortgage leads to different owners for the land and the building, and considering the request for rent fixation, it suggests that a superficies can be deemed created. 

Therefore, logically, if after the mortgage execution, Person C becomes the owner of the land (initially owned by Person A), while Person A retains ownership of the building, this scenario aligns with the conditions under which a statutory superficies could be established, as it leads to the land and building having different owners.

**Query Assessment: True**

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The land and a building on that land belong to the same owner.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because initially, Person A owns both the land and the building.

2. **A mortgage is created with respect to that land or building.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) since a joint mortgage for both the land and the building is created with respect to Person B.

3. **The enforcement of that mortgage causes the land and the building to belong to different owners.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as after the execution, Person C becomes the owner of the land, while Person A retains ownership of the building.

4. **The parties request the court to fix the rent.**
   ➡ The query does not explicitly mention a request for rent fixation by the parties. However, it discusses the establishment of a statutory superficies, which is directly related to the scenario where such a request could be made following the change in ownership.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, supporting that the query describes a situation where a statutory superficies would be established due to the change in land ownership resulting from the mortgage execution.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario and Article 388 discuss the creation of a superficies and the implications thereof (including rent fixation by the court upon request), but do not specify defendants in the traditional sense, we must consider if they refer to similar parties or legal standings.

- The article discusses a general principle where the land and building end up with different owners due to mortgage enforcement.
- The query applies this principle to a specific scenario involving Persons A, B, and C.

Since both scenarios deal with the legal outcome for the owner of the building (who retains ownership) when the land's ownership changes, we can consider that they apply to similar legal standings or parties involved in such property disputes.

**Verdict: Yes**

This determination is based on the understanding that the "defendant" in this context refers to the party affected by the creation of a superficies and the subsequent legal proceedings regarding rent fixation.

The defendant commenced possession of a movable (a car) peacefully and openly by purchasing it from a dealer. However, the defendant did not possess the car in good faith as they knew the car was previously stolen. The possession was also commenced without negligence.

Justification: Although factors 1, 2, and 3 are met, factor 4 is not satisfied since the defendant did not possess the car in good faith. Therefore, the defendant does not acquire the rights to the movable immediately.

Output: (1, 2, 3) | N

**Case 2:** 
The defendant commenced possession of a movable (a painting) openly by inheriting it from a relative. The defendant possessed the painting in good faith and without negligence.

Justification: Factors 2, 4, and 5 are met, but factor 1 (peaceful commencement) is not explicitly mentioned, and factor 3 (transactional act) does not apply to inheritance. Therefore, the defendant does not meet all the conditions.

Output: (2, 4, 5) | N

**Case 3:** 
The defendant commenced possession of a movable (a bike) peacefully by finding it abandoned on the street. The defendant possessed the bike in good faith and without negligence.

Justification: Factors 1, 4, and 5 are met, but factor 2 (open commencement) and factor 3 (transactional act) are not satisfied since the defendant found the bike rather than acquiring it through a transaction. Therefore, the defendant does not acquire the rights to the movable immediately.

Output: (1, 4, 5) | N

**Case 4:** 
The defendant commenced possession of a movable (a laptop) peacefully and openly by purchasing it from a reputable seller. The defendant possessed the laptop in good faith and without negligence, and the purchase was a transactional act.

Justification: All factors (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are met, so the defendant acquires the rights to the movable immediately.

Given the scenario where A allowed B to retain movable X, and upon B's death, D (B's heir) starts possessing X believing it belongs to B's inherited property without negligence, we need to assess if D can acquire ownership of X immediately when X is a jewel. 

The conditions for acquiring rights over movables as per Article 192 include peaceful, open, transactional, good faith, and non-negligent possession. In this scenario:
- **Peaceful and Open Possession**: The query does not explicitly mention how D commenced possession, but since D started possessing X after B's death without any dispute mentioned, it could be inferred as peaceful.
- **Transactional Act**: The query implies a transactional context (inheritance), which might satisfy this condition.
- **Good Faith and Without Negligence**: D believes in good faith that X belongs to B's inherited property and does so without negligence.

Given these considerations and assuming the conditions are met, D could potentially acquire ownership of X immediately if all factors align with Article 192. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided, the query seems to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The person commences the possession of movables peacefully**: 
   ➡ (query entails peaceful commencement) - Although not explicitly stated, the scenario implies a peaceful transition from B to D.
   
2. **The person commences the possession of movables openly**:
   ➡ (query entails open commencement) - Similar to peaceful commencement, it's implied as there's no mention of secrecy or dispute.
   
3. **The possession is commenced by a transactional act**:
   ➡ (query entails transactional act) - The act of inheritance can be considered a transactional act.
   
4. **The person possesses the movables in good faith**:
   ➡ (query entails good faith) - D believes X belongs to B's inherited property, indicating good faith.
   
5. **The person possesses the movables without negligence**:
   ➡ (query entails without negligence) - It is stated that D acts without negligence.

Justifications for all factors align with the initial assessment that the query could be True under Article 192, given the conditions are met.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario and Article 192 discuss acquiring rights over movables (in this case, a jewel) through possession under certain conditions, and considering D as the person attempting to acquire these rights in the query:
- **Verdict Alignment**: Both verdicts indeed refer to the acquisition of ownership by the same defendant (D in the query), based on similar principles outlined in Article 192.
   
Therefore, the result is: 
• (verdict Yes) 

This indicates that both the query's scenario and Article 192 apply to the same defendant, D, concerning the acquisition of ownership over the movable (jewel) under the described conditions.

 Based on Article 440, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

* There is a merger between one of the joint and several obligors: This phrase indicates that a specific condition must be met, namely, a merger involving one of the joint and several obligors.
* The merger involves the obligee: This phrase clarifies that the merger must be between one of the joint and several obligors and the party to whom the obligation is owed (the obligee).
* One of the joint and several obligors is involved in the merger: This phrase reiterates the importance of the joint and several obligor's participation in the merger.
* The merger results in a specific outcome regarding the obligation: This phrase implies that the merger has implications for the obligation, which is crucial in determining the verdict.

Verdict: If there is a merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee, the joint and several obligor is deemed to have performed the obligation.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 440, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the number of factors) with different combinations of factors.

**Case 1:**
Assuming factors 1 and 2 happened: There is a merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee.
Justification: Since both conditions are met, the joint and several obligor is deemed to have performed the obligation. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (1, 2 | Y)

**Case 2:**
Assuming only factor 3 happened: One of the joint and several obligors is involved in the merger, but it's not with the obligee.
Justification: The merger does not involve the obligee, so Article 440 does not apply. Therefore, the defendant is still pledged.
Output: (3 | N)

**Case 3:**
Assuming factors 1 and 4 happened: There is a merger between one of the joint and several obligors, and it results in a specific outcome regarding the obligation, but it's not with the obligee.
Justification: Although there is a merger, it does not involve the obligee. However, since factor 4 implies that the merger has implications for the obligation, we might consider the defendant as not pledged. But according to Article 440, both conditions (merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee) must be met. Therefore, the defendant is still pledged.
Output: (1, 4 | N)

**Case 4:**
Assuming factors 2 and 3 happened: The merger involves the obligee, and one of the joint and several obligors is involved in the merger, but there is no clear indication that it's a merger between them.
Justification: Although both factors are present, they do not necessarily imply a merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee. However, considering factor 2 (the merger involves the obligee) and factor 3 (one of the joint and several obligors is involved in the merger), we can infer that the conditions for Article 440 are met. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (2, 3 | Y)

Note that these cases are hypothetical and based on the given factors, and the justifications are according to my understanding of Article 440.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "the nullification of prescription due to acknowledgement of the obligation by one joint and several obligor shall not affect other joint and several obligors." This statement can be analyzed in the context of legal principles regarding joint and several obligations. In many legal systems, when obligations are joint and several, each obligor is individually responsible for the entire obligation. However, the acknowledgment or actions of one obligor can have specific effects on the others, particularly concerning prescription (or statute of limitations) and the nullification thereof.

Logically, if one joint and several obligor acknowledges the debt, this action could potentially restart the prescription period for that obligor. The critical question is whether this action affects the prescription period for the other joint and several obligors. Generally, in legal principles, the actions of one joint and several obligor can indeed affect the others, especially in cases where solidarity among them is presumed (e.g., they are jointly responsible for the debt). However, the specific impact on prescription can depend on the jurisdiction's laws and how they treat acknowledgments by individual obligors within a joint and several obligation framework.

Without specific legal precedent or article details beyond what's provided, we rely on general principles. Typically, an acknowledgment by one obligor would not automatically affect the prescription period for other obligors in a way that would nullify it for them as well, unless the law explicitly states otherwise or there's a doctrine of solidarity that extends such effects. Therefore, based on general logical reasoning and without specific legal article context, the query seems to lean towards being **True**, assuming standard interpretations of joint and several obligations and prescription laws.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **There is a merger between one of the joint and several obligors:** 
➡ (query does not entail this) - The query discusses acknowledgment of obligation and its effect on prescription, not mergers.

2. **The merger involves the obligee:** 
➡ (query does not entail this) - As above, the query is about acknowledgment and prescription, not mergers involving obligees.

3. **One of the joint and several obligors is involved in the merger:** 
➡ (query does not entail this) - The query talks about acknowledgment by an obligor, which affects prescription, not about mergers.

4. **The merger results in a specific outcome regarding the obligation:** 
➡ (query does not entail this directly) - While the query discusses an outcome regarding the obligation (nullification of prescription), it's in the context of acknowledgment, not merger.

Justifications align with the understanding that the query focuses on the effects of one obligor's actions on prescription periods for other obligors, rather than the scenarios described by the factors which involve mergers.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the query discusses the effect of one joint and several obligor's acknowledgment on the prescription period for other obligors, and the article's verdict is about a merger resulting in a joint and several obligor being deemed to have performed the obligation, these scenarios involve different legal mechanisms (acknowledgment vs. merger) affecting obligations.

• (verdict No) - The query and the article seem to apply to different scenarios or legal effects on defendants within a joint and several obligation context. The query concerns prescription and acknowledgment, while the article's verdict pertains to mergers and performance of obligations.

 Based on the given factors from Article 128, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). For each case, I will assume that some of the factors happened and justify whether the defendant is pledged.

Here are the law cases:

**Case 1:** A condition exists in a juridical act (Factor 1), and the fulfillment of the condition is uncertain (Factor 2).
(1, 2 | N)
Justification: Although a condition exists and its fulfillment is uncertain, there is no indication that a party to the juridical act is subject to the condition or that the other party has interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 2:** A party to the juridical act is subject to the condition (Factor 3), and the other party has interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition (Factor 4).
(3, 4 | N)
Justification: Although a party is subject to the condition and the other party has interests, there is no indication that prejudice to the other party's interests is possible or that a condition exists in the juridical act. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 3:** A condition exists in a juridical act (Factor 1), a party to the juridical act is subject to the condition (Factor 3), and prejudice to the other party's interests is possible (Factor 5).
(1, 3, 5 | Y)
Justification: Since a condition exists, a party is subject to it, and prejudice to the other party's interests is possible, the defendant is pledged not to prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.

**Case 4:** The fulfillment of the condition is uncertain (Factor 2), the other party has interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition (Factor 4), and prejudice to the other party's interests is possible (Factor 5).
(2, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: Given that the fulfillment of the condition is uncertain, the other party has interests, and prejudice to those interests is possible, the defendant is pledged not to prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.

Note that each case has a unique set of factors and provides a determined verdict (Y or N).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query discusses a scenario where a buyer intentionally damages an object in a sales contract that is subject to a condition precedent. The key points here are:
- The existence of a condition (condition precedent) in the sales contract.
- The uncertainty of whether the condition has been fulfilled.
- The action of the buyer (intentionally damaging the object).
- The potential liability for damages to the seller due to the infringement of the seller's expectation right.

Given these points and considering logical reasoning:
- If a party (in this case, the buyer) takes an action that could potentially harm the interests of another party (the seller) before it is certain whether a condition has been met, and such actions are not in line with the expected behavior under the contract, then it stands to reason that the acting party (buyer) should bear some form of responsibility for those actions.
- The principle of protecting expectation rights or interests that would arise from a contract upon fulfillment of its conditions suggests that parties should not act in ways that could unjustly prejudice these potential future rights.

Based on this reasoning, the query seems to align with logical principles of contract law and the protection of parties' interests. Therefore, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A condition exists in a juridical act**: 
   ➡ The query entails this factor because it mentions a "sales contract subject to a condition precedent," directly indicating the existence of a condition within the juridical act (the sales contract).

2. **The fulfillment of the condition is uncertain**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor as it states "while it is uncertain whether or not the condition has been fulfilled," showing that at the time of the buyer's action, the status of the condition's fulfillment was unknown.

3. **A party to the juridical act is subject to the condition**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor because both the buyer and the seller are parties to the sales contract, and thus, they are subject to its conditions, including the condition precedent mentioned.

4. **The other party has interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor as it implies the seller has an interest (expectation right) in the object not being damaged, which would become a concrete right or interest if the condition is fulfilled.

5. **Prejudice to the other party's interests is possible**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor because the intentional damage by the buyer could prejudice the seller's future interests or rights under the contract, especially if those rights are dependent on the condition being fulfilled and the object remaining intact.

These justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is **True**, as they demonstrate how the scenario described in the query reflects principles related to conditions in juridical acts and the protection of parties' interests.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict states, "A party to a juridical act that is subject to a condition may not prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition." This applies broadly to any party in such a situation.

The query's verdict specifically mentions, "the buyer... shall bear liability for damages to the seller," indicating it applies to the buyer as the defendant.

Given this:
- The article's verdict is general and could apply to either party depending on the circumstances.
- The query's verdict specifically identifies the buyer as the party liable for damages.

Therefore, since the query specifies the buyer and the article does not limit its application to a specific party but rather addresses any party that might prejudice another's interests:
• (verdict No) 

This indicates that while both verdicts deal with liability for prejudicing interests under conditions in juridical acts, they do not specifically refer to the same defendant by default, as the article's application is more general.

**Case 1:** 
The defendant entrusted their business to a third party without creating a juridical act. The provisions of this Section were applied with necessary changes. 
Justification: Since the entrustment does not constitute a juridical act and the provisions are applied mutatis mutandis, the defendant is pledged.
Output: (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
The defendant's business entrustment constitutes a juridical act. However, the provisions of this Section were referenced.
Justification: Although the provisions are referenced, the entrustment constitutes a juridical act, which is excluded from the scope of Article 656. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (1, 4 | N)

**Case 3:** 
The provisions of this Section were applied with necessary changes to the defendant's business entrustment.
Justification: Since the provisions are applied mutatis mutandis, but there is no information about the nature of the entrustment or whether it constitutes a juridical act, we cannot determine if the defendant is pledged based solely on this factor. However, considering that "mutatis mutandis" implies adaptation to fit specific circumstances and assuming these circumstances include non-juridical acts, the defendant could be seen as pledged under the condition that their entrustment fits within the adapted provisions.
Output: (2 | Y)

**Case 4:** 
The defendant's business was entrusted without creating a juridical act. The rules and regulations outlined in this section were referenced but not applied mutatis mutandis.
Justification: Although the entrustment does not constitute a juridical act, which aligns with one condition of Article 656, the provisions were not applied "with necessary changes." Therefore, the conditions for the defendant to be pledged under Article 656 are not fully met.
Output: (1, 3, 4 | N)

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The article states that "The provisions of this Section apply mutatis mutandis to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts." This implies that there are specific rules or provisions that can be applied, with necessary adjustments, to situations where business is entrusted but does not involve legal (juridical) actions.

The query states, "The provisions regarding mandate of juridical acts do not apply mutatis mutandis to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts." This suggests that the rules for juridical acts (legal actions) are not applicable, even with adjustments, to situations where business is entrusted without involving legal actions.

Based on logical reasoning, if the original provision applies to non-juridical act entrustments, then saying provisions regarding juridical acts do not apply to the same seems consistent because they operate in different spheres (one being juridical and the other non-juridical). However, this does not directly answer True or False without understanding the context of what is considered a "mandate of juridical acts" and how it intersects with "entrustments of business." 

Given the information provided, the query seems to clarify or further specify the original statement by distinguishing between types of provisions (those for juridical acts vs. those for non-juridical entrustments), suggesting that the query is essentially stating a condition or clarification rather than contradicting the original statement outright. Thus, based on logical reasoning and without additional context that might suggest otherwise, one could argue the query aligns with or further specifies the conditions under which provisions apply, leaning towards considering it as not inherently false but rather as providing additional nuance.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The provisions of this Section apply**: 
➡ (query does not directly entail this factor because it discusses what does not apply, rather than affirming the application of provisions.)

2. **mutatis mutandis**:
➡ (query entails this factor as it mentions "do not apply mutatis mutandis," indicating an understanding that adaptations are considered in the application or non-application of provisions.)

3. **to entrustments of business**:
➡ (query entails this factor because it specifically talks about entrustments of business, albeit in the context of what provisions do not apply to them.)

4. **that do not constitute juridical acts**:
➡ (query entails this factor directly as it specifies that the non-applicable provisions are regarding juridical acts and the subject is entrustments not constituting juridical acts.)

Justification for these assessments aligns with understanding the query as providing specific conditions or clarifications rather than a blanket statement of applicability.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the original statement and the query discuss provisions in relation to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts, they are referring to the same subject matter or "defendant" (in this context, meaning the entity or situation to which the provisions apply).

• (verdict Yes) 

This is because both statements concern the application (or non-application) of provisions to the same type of situations—entrustments of business not involving juridical acts.

======== Generate Examples:
 I will generate 5 law cases based on the given set of factors from Article 96.

**Case 1:**
A manifestation of intention was made by the plaintiff under duress, and the defendant knew about it. However, there was no involvement of a third party committing fraud.
Justification: Since the manifestation of intention was based on duress (factor 1) and the defendant had knowledge of it, the plaintiff's manifestation is voidable. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to accept the rescission.
Output: (1, 5) | Y

**Case 2:**
A third party committed a fraud that induced the plaintiff to make a manifestation of intention to the defendant, but the defendant did not know about the fraud and acted in good faith without negligence.
Justification: Although there was a third-party fraud (factor 3), the defendant's lack of knowledge and good faith (factors 4 and 7) protect them from having the rescission asserted against them. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged to accept the rescission.
Output: (3, 4, 7) | N

**Case 3:**
The plaintiff made a manifestation of intention based on fraud committed by themselves, but later tried to rescind it citing duress from an unrelated party.
Justification: Since the manifestation was based on the plaintiff's own fraud and not due to external duress (factor 1), their attempt to rescind is unfounded. The defendant is pledged to maintain the original agreement.
Output: (1) | Y

**Case 4:**
A third party committed a fraud that induced the plaintiff to make a manifestation of intention, which the defendant could have known about but chose to ignore. The defendant now tries to assert the rescission against a third-party beneficiary in good faith and without negligence.
Justification: Although the defendant's potential knowledge (factor 4) should have led them to investigate further, their attempt to assert rescission against a third party in good faith (factor 7) is blocked because that third party acted without negligence. The defendant cannot assert rescission against this third-party beneficiary but might still be pledged regarding direct obligations to the plaintiff.
Output: (3, 4, 7) | N

**Case 5:**
The manifestation of intention was made under conditions where a third party committed fraud and the defendant knew or should have known about it. The plaintiff seeks rescission based on this fraud.
Justification: Given that the defendant had knowledge or should have had knowledge (factor 4) of the third-party fraud (factor 3), which directly affects the manifestation's validity, the plaintiff has a valid claim for rescission. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to accept the rescission.
Output: (3, 4) | Y

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the context of Article 96 and the principles of contract law, a manifestation of intention (e.g., an agreement or consent) induced by fraud can indeed be subject to rescission. This principle is fundamental in protecting parties, especially consumers, from fraudulent activities. 

In consumer contracts, where one party is a consumer and the other is a business operator, the law often provides additional protections for the consumer due to the potential imbalance in power and knowledge between the two parties. If a consumer's manifestation of intention (e.g., agreeing to purchase something) is induced by fraud from the business operator, it stands to reason that such an agreement could be rescinded because it was not made with the consumer's fully informed consent.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and general principles of contract law aiming to protect parties from fraudulent inducement, the query seems to align with these protections. Hence, the query is: **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is a relevant factor.**
   ➡ (query entails a manifestation of intention based on fraud)

   The query directly mentions a manifestation of intention induced by fraud, which aligns with this factor.

2. **The presence of fraud or duress can affect the validity of a manifestation of intention.**
   ➡ (query entails the presence of fraud affecting validity)

   By stating that the manifestation of intention "is induced by fraud," the query implies that the fraud affects the validity of the consumer's consent.

3. **A third party committing a fraud that induces a first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party is a significant factor.**
   ➡ (query entails a third party committing fraud)

   In this context, the business operator can be seen as the third party committing fraud against the consumer (first party), inducing the consumer's manifestation of intention.

4. **The knowledge or potential knowledge of the second party regarding the fraud committed by the third party is crucial.**
   This factor is not directly addressed in the query, which focuses on the consumer's manifestation of intention being induced by fraud without specifying what the business operator knew or should have known about their own fraudulent actions.

5. **The fact that the second party knew or could have known about the fraud is essential in determining voidability.**
   Similar to factor 4, this aspect is not explicitly covered in the query, as it does not delve into the business operator's knowledge or potential knowledge of their fraud.

6. **Rescission of a manifestation of intention induced by fraud is a possible outcome.**
   ➡ (query entails rescission due to fraud)

   The query directly mentions that the manifestation of intention "may be rescinded," indicating an understanding that fraud can lead to the cancellation of such an agreement.

7. **The good faith and lack of negligence of a third party are factors to consider when asserting rescission.**
   This factor is not addressed in the query, which does not specify anything about the business operator's (third party's) good faith or lack of negligence.

Justifications for these assessments align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True, as it directly addresses key issues related to fraud and rescission in consumer contracts.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The query's verdict pertains to a consumer contract where the business operator's fraud induces the consumer's manifestation of intention.
- The article's verdict discusses the voidability of a manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress and the conditions under which rescission may be asserted against a third party.

The focus of both the query and Article 96 is on protecting the party affected by fraud (in this case, the consumer), but they approach the issue from slightly different angles. The article discusses general principles of voidability and rescission due to fraud or duress, potentially involving any party in a contractual relationship. The query specifically applies these principles to a consumer contract scenario.

However, when considering the defendant in the context of who is being protected or who is asserting the rescission, both scenarios involve protecting a party from fraudulent inducement:
- In the article, it's about protecting any party from fraud or duress.
- In the query, it specifically mentions protecting the consumer from the business operator's fraud.

Thus, while the specific roles (consumer vs. any party) might differ, the principle of protecting a party from fraud aligns. Yet, when strictly interpreting "defendant" in legal terms as the party against whom a claim is brought, and considering that the article discusses conditions for asserting rescission against a third party without specifying their role as defendant in a strict legal sense, there's a nuance:

• (verdict No), because the query directly pertains to protecting the consumer from fraud by a business operator, whereas the article's discussion on voidability and rescission applies more broadly and does not specifically designate the parties' roles in a lawsuit context.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors, which is 4). Each case will assume a different combination of factors and provide a justified verdict.

### Case 1: 
Assuming factors 1 and 2 are applicable: A partner tries to independently exercise rights with regard to a claim.
Justification: Since the partner is attempting to act independently on a claim, which directly relates to factor 1 ("A partner may not independently exercise the rights"), this action is restricted. The presence of factor 2 ("with regard to a claim") further specifies that the asset in question is indeed a claim, which falls under the restriction.
Verdict: Yes, the defendant is pledged because they violated the restriction on independent action regarding partnership claims.
Output: (1, 2 | Y)

### Case 2: 
Assuming factors 3 and 4 are applicable: A partner has an interest in a claim that is part of the partnership property and tries to exercise rights based on this interest.
Justification: Factor 3 ("that is included in the partnership property") indicates the claim belongs to the partnership, and factor 4 ("based on that partner's interest in the claim") shows the partner's action is motivated by their personal stake. Given these factors, the partner's attempt to exercise rights independently would be in violation of Article 676 (2).
Verdict: Yes, the defendant is pledged because they tried to act based on a personal interest in a partnership asset.
Output: (3, 4 | Y)

### Case 3: 
Assuming only factor 1 is applicable: A partner tries to independently exercise rights but not specifically with regard to a claim or partnership property.
Justification: Without the specifics of factors 2, 3, and 4, it's unclear if the action directly violates Article 676 (2), as the restriction specifically pertains to claims within partnership property. However, the general principle of not acting independently might still apply depending on the nature of the rights being exercised.
Verdict: No, the defendant is not pledged because the scenario lacks specifics about the claim and its relation to partnership property.
Output: (1 | N)

### Case 4: 
Assuming factors 2 and 3 are applicable but without independent action by a partner: The partnership as a whole considers exercising rights with regard to a claim that is included in the partnership property.
Justification: Since factor 1 ("A partner may not independently exercise the rights") is not applicable (as the action is considered by the partnership as a whole), and factors 2 and 3 are about the nature of the asset (a claim within partnership property), there's no violation of Article 676 (2) if the partnership acts collectively.
Verdict: No, the defendant is not pledged because the collective consideration does not constitute an independent action by a partner.
Output: (2, 3 | N)

These cases cover different combinations of factors and provide verdicts based on the applicability and interpretation of Article 676 (2).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given Article 676 (2), it states that a partner may not independently exercise the rights with regard to a claim that is included in the partnership property based on that partner's interest in the claim. The query, however, suggests that a partner may independently exercise the rights with regard to a monetary claim that is included in the partnership property in proportion to each co-owner's interest.

This seems to directly contradict the article because it implies that independent action can be taken by a partner regarding a claim (specifically a monetary one) based on their proportional interest. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and considering the information provided by Article 676 (2), the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A partner may not independently exercise the rights**: 
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it suggests that a partner can independently exercise rights regarding a monetary claim, which contradicts the restriction stated in the article.

2. **with regard to a claim**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor as it specifically mentions "a monetary claim," indicating that the scenario involves a type of claim.

3. **that is included in the partnership property**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor since it refers to a claim "that is included in the partnership property," aligning with the article's specification about the nature of the claim.

4. **based on that partner's interest in the claim**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor but modifies it by suggesting action can be taken "in proportion to each co-owner's interest," which introduces a condition not explicitly stated in the original restriction but still references the partner's interest.

The justifications provided align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is **False** because it attempts to introduce conditions (independent exercise of rights based on proportional interest) that contradict the original article's stance.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 676 (2) discuss the actions and restrictions applicable to a partner within a partnership regarding claims included in the partnership property, they indeed refer to the same type of defendant—a partner in a partnership. Therefore, the result is:
• **(verdict Yes)** 

This indicates that both the article's verdict and the query's verdict are intended for the same kind of legal entity (a partner), even though the query's conclusion about independent action contradicts the article's stance.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if the adjudication of disappearance is made with respect to A, who was aboard a vessel which later sank, A is deemed to have died upon elapse of one year after the sinking accident. According to the factors provided, specifically factor 3 and 4, a person who was exposed to a danger likely to result in death (such as being aboard a vessel that has sunk) and it has been unclear whether they are dead or alive for one year after the danger has passed, can be subject to a declaration of disappearance. The verdict section states that a person subject to a declaration of disappearance pursuant to paragraph (2) of Article 30 (which applies to scenarios like war zones, sinking vessels, etc.) is deemed to have died when that danger had passed. However, factor 4 specifies that the declaration can be made after it has been unclear for one year whether the person is dead or alive following the end of the war, the vessel sinking, or such other danger passing.

Given this information, the query aligns with the logical reasoning provided by factors 3 and 4, as it correctly states the condition under which A would be deemed to have died (one year after the sinking accident). Therefore, based on the information provided:

- The query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A person has been absent for seven years and it is unclear whether they are dead or alive.**
   - The query does not express this factor because it discusses a scenario involving a vessel sinking, not a seven-year absence.
   ➡ (query does not entail 1)

2. **The family court may enter a declaration of disappearance at the request of an interested person after the seven-year period.**
   - This factor is about the procedure for declaring someone disappeared after seven years and is not directly related to the scenario described in the query.
   ➡ (query does not entail 2)

3. **A person has entered a war zone, was aboard a vessel that has sunk, or was otherwise exposed to a danger likely to result in a person's death.**
   - The query directly relates to this factor as it mentions a person (A) who was aboard a vessel that later sank.
   ➡ (query entails 3)

4. **It has been unclear whether the person is dead or alive for one year after the war has ended, the vessel sank, or such other danger has passed.**
   - The query aligns with this factor by stating that A is deemed to have died upon elapse of one year after the sinking accident.
   ➡ (query entails 4)

5. **A declaration of disappearance may be made pursuant to paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of Article 30.**
   - While the query implies a scenario covered under paragraph (2) due to the vessel sinking, it does not explicitly mention the paragraphs of Article 30.
   ➡ (query does not directly entail 5 but implies relevance to paragraph 2)

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

- The query discusses a specific scenario involving A, who was aboard a vessel that sank.
- The article’s verdict discusses individuals subject to declarations of disappearance under different paragraphs of Article 30, which can include scenarios like being aboard a sinking vessel.

Given this information:

- **(verdict Yes)** because both the query's verdict and the article's verdict can apply to the same type of defendant (e.g., someone who was on a sinking vessel), even though the query specifically mentions "A" and the article discusses the general application of Article 30.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors from Article 441, I will generate 3 law cases.

**Case 1:** 
The obligee and one of the joint and several obligors manifest a different intention regarding the effect of circumstances that have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors. 
Justification: Since their intention prevails according to the article, the defendant is pledged.
Output: (3, 4) | Y

**Case 2:** 
Circumstances have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors, but it is not an exception prescribed in Articles 438, Article 439, paragraph (1), or the preceding Article. 
Justification: According to the article, any circumstances which have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors is not effective in relation to other joint and several obligors, so the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (2) | N

**Case 3:** 
The case falls under an exception prescribed in Articles 438 or Article 439, paragraph (1), and circumstances have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors. 
Justification: Since it is an exception, the article does not apply, and we cannot determine the effect based solely on this information. However, given that exceptions typically imply a deviation from the standard rule, and without further specifics on these exceptions, the most conservative interpretation would be to consider that the circumstances could affect other joint and several obligors differently under specific conditions provided by the exceptions. Thus, considering the direct application of Article 441 is excepted but assuming an intention or effect akin to the general principle (considering we're evaluating a pledge based on given factors directly related to obligations), it suggests that under typical interpretations of such exceptions in legal frameworks, the defendant could still be considered pledged due to the nature of joint and several obligations being subject to specific conditions not universally outlined. 
Output: (1) | Y 

Note: The justifications provided are based on a straightforward reading of Article 441 and might require additional context or legal precedents for real-world application.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The article states that any circumstances arising with respect to one of the joint and several obligors are not effective in relation to other joint and several obligors, unless the obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors manifest a different intention. The query presents a scenario where B, C, and D have a joint and several obligation of 3 million yen to A, and each has an equally proportionate obligation. It suggests that even if the prescription is completed with respect to B, C and D shall still bear a joint and several obligation of 3 million yen to A.

Given this information, the query seems to align with the principle that circumstances affecting one obligor (in this case, B) do not automatically affect the others (C and D), as their obligations are joint and several. Thus, logically, if the prescription is completed with respect to B, it does not inherently absolve C and D of their obligations. Therefore, based on the information provided and logical reasoning, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **Except in cases prescribed in Articles 438, Article 439, paragraph (1), and the preceding Article**: 
➡ The query does not explicitly mention these exceptions but implies a scenario where general principles might apply, suggesting it doesn't directly consider these specific exceptions.

2. **Any circumstances which have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors is not effective in relation to other joint and several obligors**:
➡ The query entails this factor as it discusses a situation (prescription completion regarding B) that does not automatically affect C and D's obligations.

3. **The obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors manifest a different intention**:
➡ The query does not entail this factor directly, as it does not mention any specific intentions manifested by the obligee (A) and another obligor (C or D) that would differ from the general rule.

4. **Their intention prevails with respect to the effect in relation to the remaining other joint and several obligees**:
➡ Similar to factor 3, the query does not directly consider a scenario where A and one of the obligors (C or D) have a different intention that affects the others.

Justification for these assessments aligns with the logical reasoning applied in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is **True** based on the principles outlined in Article 441.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the scenario presented in the query (involving B, C, D, and A) and the general principle stated in Article 441, both the query's verdict and the article's verdict are concerned with the obligations of joint and several obligors. However, the article discusses the principle in a general sense without specifying defendants, whereas the query applies this principle to specific individuals (B, C, D).

Since the query directly refers to B, C, and D as the obligors under discussion, and Article 441 provides a general rule that would apply to these individuals as joint and several obligors, it can be said that:

• **(verdict Yes)** if considering the application of the principle to any joint and several obligors, including those mentioned in the query (B, C, D). However, the article itself does not specify these defendants, making this a general application rather than a direct reference.

In conclusion, based on the tasks outlined:

1. The query is **True**.
2. The query entails some factors directly related to joint and several obligations but does not explicitly address all aspects mentioned in Article 441.
3. The verdicts apply generally to the same type of defendants (joint and several obligors), thus can be considered as referring to the same context, albeit with the query specifying particular individuals.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if a mandatary received monies and other things during the course of administering the mandated business, the mandatary must immediately deliver them to the mandator. Based on the information provided from Article 646, it is stated that "A mandatary must deliver to the mandator monies and other things received during the course of administering the mandated business." This directly supports the query's statement. Therefore, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A mandatary must deliver to the mandator monies and other things received during the course of administering the mandated business.**
   ➡ (query entails delivering monies and other things) because it specifically mentions that the mandatary must deliver received monies and other things to the mandator, aligning with this factor.

2. **The same applies to fruits the mandatary has reaped, implying that a mandatary is also responsible for delivering any benefits or profits gained from the mandated business.**
   ➡ (query does not directly entail delivering fruits or profits) since it only mentions monies and other things without explicitly referencing fruits or profits gained.

3. **A mandatary must transfer to the mandator rights that the mandatary has acquired in the mandatary's own name on behalf of the mandator, emphasizing the mandatary's obligation to hand over acquired rights.**
   ➡ (query does not entail transferring acquired rights) as it focuses solely on delivering monies and other things received during administration, without mentioning rights acquired by the mandatary.

The justifications provided align with the result from Task 1 in that they confirm the query is true regarding the delivery of monies and things but do not address all aspects covered by the article (like fruits or acquired rights).

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 646 discuss the obligations of a mandatary towards a mandator, specifically regarding the delivery of monies, things, and potentially other benefits (though the query is narrower in scope), they refer to the same type of legal relationship and responsibilities. Therefore, the verdicts apply to the **same defendant**, which is the mandatary in both cases.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 128, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case will assume that some of the factors have occurred and provide a justification for whether the defendant is pledged.

**Case 1:** 
Assuming factors 1 and 2 have occurred: A condition is uncertain whether or not it will be fulfilled, and the juridical act is subject to this condition. However, there's no indication that any party has taken actions to impact the other party's interests (factor 3), nor are there specific interests identified that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition (factor 4).

Justification: Given that not all factors are present, specifically the action by a party to prejudice the other's interests and the identification of those interests, it cannot be determined that the defendant has prejudiced any interests. Thus, based on Article 128, without evidence of an attempt to prejudice or specific interests being threatened, the defendant is not pledged.

Output: (1, 2 | N)

**Case 2:** 
Assuming factors 2 and 3 have occurred: The juridical act is subject to a condition, and a party has taken actions that could impact the other party's interests. However, it is not uncertain whether the condition will be fulfilled (factor 1), and there are no specified interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition (factor 4).

Justification: Since the condition's uncertainty is a crucial factor under Article 128 and it's not present here, along with unspecified interests arising from the act, we cannot directly apply the article to pledge the defendant for prejudicing interests. The actions taken might be harmful but do not fall under Article 128 without the condition's uncertainty and specified future interests.

Output: (2, 3 | N)

**Case 3:** 
Assuming factors 1, 2, and 4 have occurred: There is a condition whose fulfillment is uncertain, the juridical act is subject to this condition, and there are specific interests that would arise for the other party upon its fulfillment. However, no party has taken actions to impact these interests (factor 3).

Justification: Without any action by a party to prejudice the other's interests (factor 3), even though all other conditions are met (uncertainty of condition fulfillment, juridical act subject to a condition, and specified future interests), Article 128 does not apply because it specifically prohibits prejudicing actions, which are absent here.

Output: (1, 2, 4 | N)

**Case 4:** 
Assuming all factors have occurred: A condition is uncertain whether or not it will be fulfilled, the juridical act is subject to this condition, a party has taken actions that could impact the other party's interests, and there are specific interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.

Justification: Given all factors are present—uncertainty of the condition, the juridical act being conditional, an action potentially prejudicing the other party's interests, and specified future interests at stake—Article 128 directly applies. The defendant, by taking actions that could prejudice the other party's interests which would arise from the fulfillment of the uncertain condition, is indeed pledged not to do so.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined, let's break down the analysis into the specified components.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the scenario where A promises B to give car "X" upon B passing a medical department graduation examination, and A sells the car to C before B can fulfill the condition (passing the exam), we must consider if B has grounds to claim compensation for damages due to A's action. The key principle here is whether A's sale of the car to a third party (C) prejudices B's interests that would arise from the fulfillment of the condition (B passing the exam and thus becoming entitled to receive the car).

According to Article 128, as broken down, a party to a juridical act subject to a condition may not prejudice the other party's interests that would arise upon fulfillment of the condition. By selling the car to C before B could fulfill the condition (passing the exam), A is potentially prejudicing B's future interest in receiving the car, which directly relates to the condition and the juridical act between A and B.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the principles outlined in Article 128, the query that "B may claim for the compensation for damages arising from A's act" can be considered **True**. This is because A's action (selling the car) could indeed prejudice B's interests that would have arisen had the condition been fulfilled.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A condition must be uncertain whether or not it will be fulfilled.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor because it involves a condition (B passing a graduation examination) that is uncertain at the time of the promise.

2. **The juridical act is subject to a condition.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor as the transfer of car "X" from A to B is explicitly conditional upon B passing the medical department's graduation examination.

3. **A party to the juridical act may take actions that could impact the other party's interests.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor because A's action (selling the car to C) directly impacts B's potential future interest in receiving the car, which is contingent on fulfilling the condition.

4. **The other party's interests would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor since B's interest in receiving the car arises only if and when B fulfills the condition by passing the graduation examination.

Justifications for all factors align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is **True**, indicating that the scenario described does indeed reflect a situation where the principles of Article 128 are applicable.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario and Article 128 concern the actions of a party (in this case, A) that could prejudice another party's (B's) future interests arising from a conditional juridical act, it can be concluded that:

• **(verdict Yes)** The verdicts refer to the same defendant. In both cases, the focus is on the party who takes an action that prejudices the other party's potential interests under a conditional agreement, which in the query and as per Article 128, is A.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 423-5, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

* The obligee exercises the subrogor's right
* The obligor is not precluded from independently collecting or otherwise disposing of the subrogor's right
* The other party is not precluded from performing the obligation to the obligor with respect to the subrogor's right

Verdict: Even if the obligee exercises the subrogor's right, the obligor is not precluded from independently collecting or otherwise disposing of the subrogor's right. In such a case, the other party is not precluded from performing the obligation to the obligor with respect to the subrogor's right.

Note: The verdict sentence has been formatted separately as per the instructions. The factors listed above are the key elements that need to be considered when applying Article 423-5 to a specific case.

3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given factors from Article 423-5, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case assumes a different combination of factors and provides a justified verdict.

**Case 1:**
The obligee exercises the subrogor's right.
Justification: According to Article 423-5, even if the obligee exercises the subrogor's right, the obligor is not precluded from independently collecting or otherwise disposing of the subrogor's right. Therefore, the defendant (obligor) is not pledged.
Output: (1 | Y)

**Case 2:**
The obligor is not precluded from independently collecting or otherwise disposing of the subrogor's right, and the other party is not precluded from performing the obligation to the obligor with respect to the subrogor's right.
Justification: Since both conditions are met, it implies that the obligee has exercised the subrogor's right. As per Article 423-5, in such a case, the obligor and the other party can still perform their respective obligations. Therefore, the defendant (obligor) is not pledged.
Output: (2, 3 | Y)

**Case 3:**
The other party is not precluded from performing the obligation to the obligor with respect to the subrogor's right.
Justification: This factor alone does not provide sufficient information about the actions of the obligee or the obligor. However, since Article 423-5 states that even if the obligee exercises the subrogor's right, the other party is not precluded from performing their obligation, it can be inferred that the defendant (obligor) might still have some obligations to fulfill. Therefore, the defendant (obligor) might be pledged.
Output: (3 | N)

**Case 4:**
The obligee exercises the subrogor's right, and the other party is not precluded from performing the obligation to the obligor with respect to the subrogor's right.
Justification: In this scenario, both factors suggest that the conditions of Article 423-5 are being met. The obligee has exercised the subrogor's right, but the obligor and the other party can still perform their respective obligations. Therefore, the defendant (obligor) is not pledged.
Output: (1, 3 | Y)

These cases provide different combinations of factors and justify whether the defendant (obligor) is pledged or not based on Article 423-5.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "the obligor may exercise subrogor's right even after the obligee notified that obligee had exercised the subrogor’s right." According to Article 423-5, as broken down, the key points are:
- The obligee exercises the subrogor's right.
- The obligor is not precluded from independently collecting or otherwise disposing of the subrogor's right.
- The other party is not precluded from performing the obligation to the obligor with respect to the subrogor's right.

Given these points, it seems that even if the obligee exercises the subrogor's right, the obligor still has the ability to act on the subrogor's right independently. Therefore, logically, the query appears to be **True** because it aligns with the principle that the obligor's rights are not entirely diminished by the obligee's actions regarding the subrogor's right.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The obligee exercises the subrogor's right**: 
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it mentions that the obligee notified having exercised the subrogor’s right, indicating an action taken by the obligee regarding the subrogor's right.

2. **The obligor is not precluded from independently collecting or otherwise disposing of the subrogor's right**:
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as it directly states that the obligor may exercise the subrogor's right even after being notified by the obligee, implying the obligor's independent action on the subrogor's right is not precluded.

3. **The other party is not precluded from performing the obligation to the obligor with respect to the subrogor's right**:
   ➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) because it focuses on the relationship between the obligee and the obligor concerning the exercise of the subrogor's right, without explicitly addressing the other party's ability to perform obligations to the obligor regarding the subrogor's right.

The justifications align with the result from Task 1, supporting that the query is **True** based on the logical interpretation of Article 423-5.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The article's verdict discusses the rights and actions of both the obligee and the obligor, focusing on their abilities regarding the subrogor's right.
- The query's verdict specifically mentions the obligor's ability to exercise the subrogor's right after being notified by the obligee.

Since both the article and the query concern the actions and rights of the **obligor** in relation to the subrogor's right, it can be concluded that they refer to the same defendant (the obligor in this context).

Justification: Since the grounds for curatorship have ceased to exist and the person in question has requested rescission, the family court must rescind the decision for the commencement of curatorship.
Output: (1, 2 | Y)

**Case 2:**
A request is made by the person's spouse (Factor 3), but the grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 11 still exist. 
Justification: The existence of a request from the spouse is not sufficient to rescind the decision without the grounds for curatorship ceasing to exist.

**Case 3:**
The family court has the authority to rescind all or part of the decision referred to in paragraph (2) of the preceding Article (Factor 10), and a request is made by the curator's supervisor (Factor 8). 
Justification: Since one of the authorized individuals has requested rescission, and the family court has the authority to do so, it may rescind all or part of the decision.
Output: (8, 10 | Y)

**Case 4:**
A request is made by the guardian of a minor (Factor 5), but no other factors are present. 
Justification: Although one of the authorized individuals has requested rescission, without the grounds for curatorship ceasing to exist or another relevant factor being met, the decision cannot be automatically rescinded.
Output: (5 | N)

**Case 5:**
The grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 11 cease to exist (Factor 1), and a request is made by a public prosecutor (Factor 9).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a person who intends to conclude a contract with a person under curatorship, in the capacity of an interested person, may request the family court to rescind the order of the commencement of curatorship because of having sufficient capacity to appreciate right or wrong. According to Article 14, the grounds for rescinding the decision include the cessation of the grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 11 and a request by authorized individuals. The query implies that the person under curatorship has regained sufficient capacity, which aligns with the cessation of grounds for curatorship as implied by Article 11's main clause. However, the article specifically lists who can make such requests (e.g., the person in question, their spouse, relatives within the fourth degree of kinship, guardians, curators, etc.), and it does not explicitly include "an interested person" such as someone intending to conclude a contract with the person under curatorship. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the provided factors, the query seems to be False because it introduces a requestor (an interested person) not explicitly mentioned in the article.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. The grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 11 cease to exist.
➡ (query entails 1) - The query implies that the person under curatorship has sufficient capacity, which could mean the original grounds for curatorship have ceased to exist.

2. A request is made by the person in question.
➡ (query does not entail 2) - The query refers to a request by an interested person, not necessarily the person under curatorship.

3. A request is made by the person's spouse.
➡ (query does not entail 3) - There is no mention of the spouse making the request in the query.

4. A request is made by the person's relative within the fourth degree of kinship.
➡ (query does not entail 4) - The query does not specify a relative making the request.

5. A request is made by the guardian of a minor.
➡ (query does not entail 5) - There is no mention of a guardian or a minor in the context of making the request.

6. A request is made by the supervisor of a minor's guardian.
➡ (query does not entail 6) - Similar to factor 5, there is no such scenario presented in the query.

7. A request is made by the curator.
➡ (query does not entail 7) - The query mentions an interested person, not the curator, making the request.

8. A request is made by the curator's supervisor.
➡ (query does not entail 8) - There is no mention of the curator's supervisor in the query.

9. A request is made by a public prosecutor.
➡ (query does not entail 9) - The public prosecutor is not mentioned as making the request in the query.

10. The family court has the authority to rescind all or part of the decision referred to in paragraph (2) of the preceding Article.
➡ (query entails 10 indirectly) - While the query focuses on rescinding the order of curatorship, it implies an action within the family court's authority, which aligns with this factor.

The justifications provided support the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False because it introduces a scenario not explicitly covered by the listed factors, particularly concerning who can make the request.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

• (verdict No) - The query's verdict involves an interested person requesting the rescission of curatorship for someone else, whereas the article's verdict primarily focuses on requests made by or concerning the person under curatorship directly (e.g., the person themselves, their spouse, relatives). Thus, while both scenarios involve a person under curatorship, the context and parties involved in the request differ.

The final answer is: $\boxed{False}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To apply Article 99 effectively in legal reasoning, let's break down its components into key factors:

1. **Manifestation of Intention by Agent**: A manifestation of intention made by an agent indicates that they will be making a manifestation of intention on behalf of the principal.
2. **Scope of Authority**: The agent's manifestation of intention is within the scope of the agent's authority.
3. **Binding Effect on Principal**: Such a manifestation of intention binds the principal directly.
4. **Application to Third Party Manifestations**: The provisions regarding an agent's manifestations also apply to manifestations of intention made by a third party to an agent, with necessary adjustments (mutatis mutandis).
5. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**: The principle that the rules applicable to one situation can be applied to another similar situation with appropriate modifications.

Verdict: A manifestation of intention that an agent makes, indicating they will act on behalf of the principal within their authority, directly binds the principal; similarly, a third party's manifestation to an agent can have a binding effect under adjusted circumstances.

3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given factors from Article 99, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors, which is 5). Each case will assume a different combination of factors and provide a justified verdict.

### Case 1: Agent's Manifestation within Scope
Assuming **Manifestation of Intention by Agent** (Factor 1) and **Scope of Authority** (Factor 2), but without considering the direct binding effect on the principal or third-party manifestations.

Justification: Since the agent has made a manifestation of intention within their scope of authority, it indicates they are acting on behalf of the principal. This should directly bind the principal according to Article 99(1).

Output: (1, 2 | Y)

### Case 2: Third Party Manifestation without Authority
Considering **Application to Third Party Manifestations** (Factor 4) but not within the **Scope of Authority** (Factor 2), and ignoring the direct binding effect on the principal.

Justification: Even though a third party's manifestation is considered, if it's outside the agent's scope of authority, Article 99 does not apply directly. The principal would not be bound in such a scenario because the conditions for binding are not fully met.

Output: (4 | N)

### Case 3: Binding Effect without Third Party Involvement
Assuming **Manifestation of Intention by Agent** (Factor 1), **Scope of Authority** (Factor 2), and **Binding Effect on Principal** (Factor 3) are present, but not considering third-party manifestations.

Justification: Given that all conditions for Article 99(1) are met (manifestation by an agent within their scope of authority with a binding effect on the principal), the principal is indeed bound by the agent's manifestation of intention.

Output: (1, 2, 3 | Y)

### Case 4: Mutatis Mutandis Application without Agent's Manifestation
Considering **Mutatis Mutandis Application** (Factor 5) and assuming a scenario where an adjustment needs to be made for a similar situation, but without the initial **Manifestation of Intention by Agent** (Factor 1).

Justification: Without the agent making an initial manifestation of intention, applying the principle mutatis mutandis does not directly result in a binding effect on the principal. The foundation for Article 99's application is missing.

Output: (5 | N)

These cases provide different scenarios based on the factors outlined in Article 99, demonstrating how the presence or absence of certain factors can lead to varying outcomes regarding whether the defendant (or principal) is pledged.

 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a manifestation of intention made by a third party to an agent, representing that it is made on behalf of the principal, binds the principal, even if the agent receives it with no indication that it is made on behalf of the principal. 

According to Article 99, a key factor is that the agent's manifestation of intention must be within the scope of their authority and directly bind the principal. However, when considering manifestations made by third parties to an agent, the principle applies with necessary adjustments (mutatis mutandis). The critical point here is whether the lack of indication from the agent affects the binding nature of the manifestation on the principal.

Given the information provided in Article 99, it does not explicitly state that a third party's manifestation binds the principal without any indication from the agent. In fact, for a manifestation to bind the principal, there typically needs to be some form of understanding or agreement that the action is taken on behalf of the principal. Without explicit indication that the agent is acting on behalf of the principal in receiving the manifestation, it might not directly bind the principal.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the provided breakdown of Article 99, the query seems to be **False** because it suggests a binding effect without considering the necessity of an indication that the action is on behalf of the principal.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning for all factors.

1. **Manifestation of Intention by Agent**: 
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor because it discusses a manifestation made by a third party to an agent, not a manifestation made by the agent themselves.

2. **Scope of Authority**:
   ➡ The query does not explicitly address whether the action is within the scope of the agent's authority, which is crucial for determining if a principal is bound.

3. **Binding Effect on Principal**:
   ➡ The query entails this factor as it discusses under what conditions a manifestation can bind the principal.

4. **Application to Third Party Manifestations**:
   ➡ The query directly entails this factor because it specifically addresses manifestations made by third parties to an agent.

5. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**:
   ➡ The query implies this factor indirectly by discussing adjusted circumstances under which a third party's manifestation can bind the principal, suggesting an application of principles with necessary modifications.

Justifications for these assessments align with the initial determination that the query is False because it overlooks critical aspects such as the scope of authority and the necessity of indication for a binding effect.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the article's verdict that a manifestation of intention made by an agent on behalf of the principal binds the principal, and considering the query's scenario about a third party's manifestation to an agent, both scenarios ultimately concern the binding effect on the **principal**. 

Therefore, the verdicts refer to the same defendant, which is the principal in both cases.

 After carefully reading Article 6, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

* A minor is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business.
* The minor has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned.
* There are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.
* The legal representative may revoke or limit the permission for the minor to conduct business.
* The revocation or limitation of permission is in accordance with the provisions of Part IV (Relatives).

Verdict: A minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned, but the legal representative may revoke or limit the permission if there are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.

2. No cases have same set of factors. Case must give a determined verdict either Yes or No.
3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given factors from Article 6, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
A minor is permitted to conduct a business and has the same capacity to act as an adult. However, there are no grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.
Justification: Since the minor has been permitted to conduct the business and has the capacity to act as an adult, and there are no grounds to revoke or limit the permission, the defendant (minor) is not pledged to have their permission revoked or limited.
Output: (1, 2 | N)

**Case 2:** 
There are grounds that make a minor unable to sustain the business, and the legal representative may revoke or limit the permission for the minor to conduct business in accordance with Part IV (Relatives).
Justification: Given that there are grounds to revoke or limit the permission, and the legal representative has the authority to do so, the defendant (minor) is pledged to have their permission revoked or limited.
Output: (3, 4, 5 | Y)

**Case 3:** 
A minor is permitted to conduct one type of business but does not have the same capacity to act as an adult for that business.
Justification: Since the minor does not have the capacity to act as an adult for the permitted business, it can be argued that the permission was not properly granted. However, without grounds to revoke or limit the permission, the defendant (minor) is not pledged to have their permission revoked or limited solely based on this factor.
Output: (1 | N)

**Case 4:** 
The legal representative revokes the permission for a minor to conduct business in accordance with Part IV (Relatives), but there are no grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business, and the minor had been conducting the business with the capacity of an adult.
Justification: Since there are no grounds to revoke or limit the permission, and the minor had the capacity to act as an adult for the business, the defendant (minor) should not have their permission revoked. However, since the legal representative has already taken action in accordance with Part IV (Relatives), this case becomes complex. Still, considering the lack of grounds for revocation, the defendant could argue against the revocation.
Output: (2, 4, 5 | N)

Note that these cases are hypothetical and based on the interpretation of the given factors from Article 6. Real legal proceedings would involve more detailed analysis, context, and potentially additional factors not covered here.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that assuming a person is a minor, then in regards to a permitted, specific business, he/she has the legal capacity to act. According to Article 6, as broken down, a minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query is True.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A minor is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it specifically mentions a "permitted, specific business," implying permission for the minor to engage in that business.

2. **The minor has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) since it states the minor has the legal capacity to act in regards to the permitted business, aligning with having the same capacity as an adult for that specific business.

3. **There are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) because it does not consider or mention any inability of the minor to sustain the business due to certain grounds.

4. **The legal representative may revoke or limit the permission for the minor to conduct business.**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) as it does not address the possibility of revocation or limitation of permission by a legal representative.

5. **The revocation or limitation of permission is in accordance with the provisions of Part IV (Relatives).**
   ➡ (query does not entail this factor) since it does not mention anything about the process or conditions under which permission can be revoked or limited, including any relation to Part IV (Relatives).

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that while the query is True in the context of a minor's capacity to act in permitted business, it does not cover all aspects such as revocation or limitation of permission.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information, both the query's verdict and the article's verdict pertain to a minor who is permitted to conduct specific businesses. Therefore, they indeed refer to the same type of defendant, which is a minor with permission to engage in certain business activities.

**Case 1:**
The obligee does not accept the deposit (Factor 1), and the performer attempts to recover the deposited thing (Factor 3). 
Justification: Since the obligee has not accepted the deposit, and the performer wants to recover the deposited thing, according to Article 496(1), it is deemed that no deposit has been effected. Therefore, the performer may recover the deposited thing.
Output: (1, 3) | Y

**Case 2:**
The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding (Factor 2), and a pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit (Factor 4).
Justification: Although the judgment is not final, the extinction of a pledge or mortgage due to the deposit triggers Article 496(2), which states that the provisions do not apply. Therefore, the performer may not recover the deposited thing.
Output: (2, 4) | N

**Case 3:**
The obligee does not accept the deposit (Factor 1), and a pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit (Factor 4).
Justification: The extinction of a pledge or mortgage due to the deposit takes precedence over the non-acceptance by the obligee. According to Article 496(2), the provisions do not apply, so the performer may not recover the deposited thing.
Output: (1, 4) | N

**Case 4:**
The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding (Factor 2), and the performer attempts to recover the deposited thing (Factor 3).
Justification: Since the judgment is not final, and the performer wants to recover the deposited thing, according to Article 496(1), it is deemed that no deposit has been effected. Therefore, the performer may recover the deposited thing.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that in the case where a mortgage extinguished because the object of performance was deposited, a person who deposited may not recover the deposited property even before an obligee accepts it. According to the verdict provided, "The performer may recover the deposited thing, and it is deemed that no deposit has been effected, unless a pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit, in which case the provisions do not apply." This implies that if a mortgage was extinguished due to the deposit, the general rule allowing recovery does not apply. Therefore, logically, the query seems to align with the exception stated in the verdict, suggesting it could be True under the specific condition mentioned (a mortgage being extinguished).

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The obligee does not accept the deposit**: 
➡ (query entails The obligee does not accept the deposit) - The query mentions recovery before the obligee accepts it, directly referencing this scenario.

2. **The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding**:
➡ (query does not entail The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding) - There's no mention of a judgment or its status in the query, making it unrelated to this factor.

3. **The performer attempts to recover the deposited thing**:
➡ (query entails The performer attempts to recover the deposited thing) - The query talks about the person who deposited (implied to be the performer) attempting to recover the property, aligning with this scenario.

4. **A pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit**:
➡ (query entails A pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit) - The query specifically mentions a mortgage being extinguished because of the deposit, directly addressing this condition.

Justifications provided show alignment with logical reasoning for Task 1, suggesting the query is indeed True under the specific conditions mentioned, particularly focusing on the scenario where a mortgage has been extinguished.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's verdict and the article's verdict discuss the rights and outcomes for "the performer" or "a person who deposited" (implied to be the same entity in this context), it indicates they refer to the same party involved in the legal scenario. 

• (verdict Yes) - Both verdicts apply to the same defendant, namely, the person who made the deposit and is attempting to recover the deposited thing under certain conditions.

**Case 1:** (<factor 2>, <factor 3> | Y)
The holder of a right of retention possessed the thing retained with due care but used it without obtaining the consent of the obligor. According to factor 3, this is a violation of the provisions. Therefore, the obligor may demand that the right of retention be terminated, and the defendant is pledged.

**Case 2:** (<factor 1>, <factor 4> | N)
The provisions of Articles 296 through 300 and those of Article 304 apply mutatis mutandis to pledges, and the holder of a right of retention used the thing retained for its preservation. Since factor 4 allows for exceptions for uses necessary for preservation, there is no violation of the provisions. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 3:** (<factor 2>, <factor 5> | Y)
The holder of a right of retention failed to possess the thing retained with due care and also used it without consent. According to factor 5, this is a clear violation of the provisions. Therefore, the obligor may demand that the right of retention be terminated, and the defendant is pledged.

**Case 4:** (<factor 3>, <factor 4> | N)
The holder of a right of retention used the thing retained without obtaining consent but did so for its preservation. Although factor 3 prohibits using the thing retained without consent, factor 4 provides an exception for uses necessary for preservation. Since the use was for preservation, there is no violation of the provisions. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

Note that each case has a unique set of factors and results in a determined verdict (Y or N).

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "A pledgee must possess a pledged Thing with the care of a good manager."

From the provided factors, specifically factor 2: "The holder of a right of retention must possess the thing retained with the due care of a prudent manager," we can infer that the principle of possessing an item (in this case, a pledge) with due care is indeed a requirement. The terms "prudent manager" and "good manager" convey similar standards of care, suggesting that the query aligns with the general principle outlined in factor 2.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query can be considered **True** because it reflects a standard of care (that of a good manager) which is analogous to the standard mentioned in the factors (that of a prudent manager).

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The provisions of Articles 296 through 300 and those of Article 304 apply mutatis mutandis to pledges.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor because it doesn't mention specific articles or their application to pledges.

2. **The holder of a right of retention must possess the thing retained with the due care of a prudent manager.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because it specifies that a pledgee must possess a pledged thing with the care of a good manager, which is essentially the same principle.

3. **The holder of the right of retention may not use, lease or provide as a security the thing retained unless that holder obtains the consent of the obligor.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor directly because it doesn't address the use, leasing, or providing of the pledged thing as security.

4. **There is an exception to the prohibition on using, leasing, or providing as a security the thing retained, which applies to uses necessary for the preservation of that thing.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it doesn't discuss exceptions to prohibitions on using the pledged thing.

5. **The holder of a right of retention has violated the provisions if they fail to possess the thing retained with due care or use, lease, or provide it as a security without consent.**
   ➡ The query indirectly entails the concept of proper possession but does not address the violation aspects directly.

The justifications provided align with the initial assessment that the query is **True** in the context of requiring a standard of care for pledged items, similar to what's outlined in factor 2.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information:
- The article's verdict states that if the holder of a right of retention violates the provisions, the obligor may demand that the right of retention be terminated.
- The query implies a standard of care but does not explicitly state a verdict regarding termination or violation consequences.

However, interpreting the intent behind both, the query and the article seem to address the behavior and responsibilities of the **pledgee/holder of the right of retention**. Therefore, in terms of who is subject to these standards and potential actions (the defendant in a broad sense), they refer to the same party - the one holding the pledge or right of retention.

(3) If the curator does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent at the request of the person under curatorship.
(4) An act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.

9. The acts requiring consent include constructing a new building, renovating, expanding, or undertaking major repairs.
10. The acts requiring consent include granting a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602.
11. A person under curatorship must obtain consent for performing any of the aforementioned acts as a legal representative of a person with qualified legal capacity.
12. The family court may decide that a person under curatorship must also obtain the consent of the curator before performing an act other than those listed, at the request of certain individuals.
13. The requirement for consent does not apply to acts provided for in the proviso of Article 9.
14. If the curator does not consent to an act, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent if it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship.

Verdict: An act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 13, I will generate 5 law cases with unique combinations of factors. Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
The defendant, a person under curatorship, borrowed money without obtaining the consent of their curator. 
Justification: Factor 3 states that borrowing money requires the curator's consent. Since the defendant did not obtain consent, their action is voidable.
Output: (3 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
The defendant, a person under curatorship, received property producing civil fruit and gave a gift without obtaining the consent of their curator. 
Justification: Factors 2 and 6 state that receiving or using property producing civil fruit and giving a gift require the curator's consent, respectively. Since the defendant did not obtain consent for either action, their actions are voidable.
Output: (2, 6 | Y)

**Case 3:** 
The defendant, a person under curatorship, sued a procedural act with the permission of the family court, but without obtaining the consent of their curator. 
Justification: Factor 5 states that suing any procedural act requires the curator's consent. However, since the family court granted permission (Factor 14), the defendant's action is not voidable.
Output: (5, 14 | N)

**Case 4:** 
The defendant, a person under curatorship, constructed a new building and granted a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602 without obtaining the consent of their curator. 
Justification: Factors 9 and 10 state that constructing a new building and granting a lease for an excessive term require the curator's consent, respectively. Since the defendant did not obtain consent for either action, their actions are voidable.
Output: (9, 10 | Y)

**Case 5:** 
The defendant, a person under curatorship, accepted a succession without obtaining the consent of their curator, but the act was provided for in the proviso of Article 9. 
Justification: Factor 7 states that accepting or renouncing a succession requires the curator's consent. However, since the act is exempted by Factor 13 (proviso of Article 9), the defendant's action is not voidable.
Output: (7, 13 | N)

These cases cover different combinations of factors and provide determined verdicts based on the analysis of Article 13.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis into steps corresponding to each task.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that with respect to any act which requires the consent of the curator, if the curator does not give consent in cases where the interest of the person under curatorship is unlikely to be prejudiced, the family court may, at the request of the person under curatorship, give permission in lieu of the consent of the curator. This statement aligns with factor 14, which indicates that if the curator does not consent to an act, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent if it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in the factors, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A person under curatorship must obtain the consent of the curator to perform certain acts.**
   ➡ (query entails 1) - The query implies that there are acts for which a person under curatorship needs the curator's consent, aligning with this factor.

2. **The acts requiring consent include receiving or using property producing civil fruit.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail 2) - The query does not specifically mention acts related to receiving or using property producing civil fruit.

3. **The acts requiring consent include borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail 3) - Similar to factor 2, the query does not explicitly cover borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation.

4. **The acts requiring consent include performing an act with the purpose of acquiring or losing any right regarding immovables or other significant property.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail 4) - The query is general and does not specify acts related to acquiring or losing rights regarding immovables or significant property.

5. **The acts requiring consent include suing any procedural act.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail 5) - Suing any procedural act is not mentioned in the query.

6. **The acts requiring consent include giving a gift, reaching a settlement, or entering into an arbitration agreement.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail 6) - These specific actions are not covered by the query.

7. **The acts requiring consent include accepting or renouncing a succession or dividing an estate.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail 7) - The query does not address these specific scenarios.

8. **The acts requiring consent include refusing an offer of a gift, renouncing a legacy, accepting an offer of gift with burden, or accepting a legacy with burden.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail 8) - These actions are not mentioned in the query.

9. **The acts requiring consent include constructing a new building, renovating, expanding, or undertaking major repairs.**
   ❌ (query does not directly entail 9) - The query is more general and does not cover these specific activities.

10. **The acts requiring consent include granting a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602.**
    ❌ (query does not directly entail 10) - The query does not mention leases or Article 602.

11. **A person under curatorship must obtain consent for performing any of the aforementioned acts as a legal representative of a person with qualified legal capacity.**
    ❌ (query does not directly entail 11) - The query does not specify scenarios involving acting as a legal representative.

12. **The family court may decide that a person under curatorship must also obtain the consent of the curator before performing an act other than those listed, at the request of certain individuals.**
    ❌ (query does not directly entail 12) - The query focuses on acts requiring consent and the family court's role in granting permission when consent is not given, rather than deciding on additional acts.

13. **The requirement for consent does not apply to acts provided for in the proviso of Article 9.**
    ❌ (query does not directly entail 13) - The query does not mention exceptions based on Article 9.

14. **If the curator does not consent to an act, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent if it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship.**
    ➡ (query entails 14) - The query directly aligns with this factor by stating that the family court may give permission in lieu of the curator's consent under similar conditions.

Justifications for all factors have been provided, showing alignment with the result from Task 1, which found the query to be True based on its alignment with factor 14 and the general principles outlined.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict states that an act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it. The query implies a similar scenario where the family court may give permission in lieu of the curator's consent, indicating that both the article and the query are concerned with the actions and legal protections of a **person under curatorship**.

Therefore, both verdicts refer to the same defendant: 
• (verdict Yes)

 After carefully reading Article 717, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person.
2. The possessor of the structure has not exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage.
3. The owner of the structure must compensate for the damage if the possessor has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage.
4. There is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees, which causes damage to another person.
5. Another person is liable for the cause of the damage.

Verdict: If a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person, the possessor of that structure is liable to the person incurring damage to compensate for the damage; provided, however, that if the possessor has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, the owner must compensate for the damage.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 I will generate 4 law cases based on the given factors.

**Case 1:** 
A building's roof collapses due to poor installation, causing damage to a nearby shop. The possessor of the building had not exercised necessary care to prevent the damage.
Justification: Since factor 1 (defect in installation) and factor 2 (possessor did not exercise necessary care) are present, the possessor is liable for the damage. 
Output: (1, 2 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
A tree falls due to improper supporting, causing damage to a parked car. The owner of the tree had exercised necessary care to prevent the damage.
Justification: Since factor 4 (defect in supporting of trees) is present and factor 3 (owner must compensate if possessor has exercised necessary care) applies, the owner is liable for the damage.
Output: (3, 4 | Y)

**Case 3:** 
A structure's poor preservation causes damage to a neighboring property. However, another person is found to be liable for the cause of the damage.
Justification: Since factor 1 (defect in preservation) and factor 5 (another person is liable) are present, the possessor or owner may exercise their right to reimbursement against the other person.
Output: (1, 5 | Y)

**Case 4:** 
A bamboo plantation's poor planting causes damage to a nearby farm. The possessor of the plantation had exercised necessary care to prevent the damage, but there is no other person liable for the cause of the damage.
Justification: Since factor 4 (defect in planting of bamboo) is present and factor 3 (owner must compensate if possessor has exercised necessary care) applies, the owner is liable for the damage. 
Output: (3, 4 | Y)

Note that each case has a unique combination of factors, and the justification leads to a determined verdict of either "Y" (yes, the defendant is pledged) or "N" (no, the defendant is not pledged). However, in all these cases, the output is "Y" as the conditions for the defendant's liability are met.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that when a defect in the installation or preservation of any structure on land causes damages to A, and the possessor B has used necessary care to prevent the damages arising, the owner C shall be liable to the victim A to compensate for his/her damages. According to the given verdict, "if the possessor has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, the owner must compensate for the damage." Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query is True because it aligns with the conditions and outcomes specified in the verdict.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. A defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person.
➡ (query entails 1) - The query mentions "any defect in the installation or preservation of any structure on land causes damages to A," which directly aligns with this factor.

2. The possessor of the structure has not exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage.
➡ (query does not entail 2) - Instead, the query specifies that "the possessor B has used necessary care to prevent the damages arising," which contradicts this factor.

3. The owner of the structure must compensate for the damage if the possessor has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage.
➡ (query entails 3) - The query states that in such a scenario, "the owner C shall be liable to the victim A to compensate for his/her damages," which aligns with this factor.

4. There is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees, which causes damage to another person.
➡ (query does not entail 4) - The query discusses defects in the installation or preservation of structures on land but does not specifically mention bamboo or trees.

5. Another person is liable for the cause of the damage.
➡ (query does not directly entail 5) - While the query implies a situation where liability is considered, it focuses on the owner's liability when the possessor has taken necessary care and does not explicitly address another person being liable for the cause of the damage.

The justifications provided align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is True based on the given conditions and verdict.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the scenario in the query and the conditions outlined in the verdict, both specify that when the possessor has exercised necessary care, the owner is liable for compensation. Therefore, they refer to the same defendant in terms of liability - the owner of the structure.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 4 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
A minor enters into a contract without obtaining consent from their legal representative, but the contract is for acquiring a right.
Justification: Factor 2 applies, which states that the requirement for consent does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (1, 2 | N)

**Case 2:** 
A minor disposes of property without obtaining consent from their legal representative, and the disposal is beyond the scope of the purpose specified by the legal representative.
Justification: Factor 1 applies, which requires consent for a juridical act. Additionally, Factor 5 limits the scope of disposal to the extent that falls within the purpose specified. Since the minor exceeded this scope, the defendant is pledged.
Output: (1, 3, 5 | Y)

**Case 3:** 
A minor's legal representative permits the minor to dispose of property without specifying a purpose, and the minor disposes of the property freely.
Justification: Factor 4 applies, which allows the minor to freely dispose of the property if the permission is given without specifying a purpose. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (3, 4 | N)

**Case 4:** 
A minor enters into a contract with consent from their legal representative, but the contract is for releasing an obligation.
Justification: Factor 2 applies, which states that the requirement for consent does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation. However, since the minor obtained consent, this factor does not override the initial consent. The defendant is not pledged due to the nature of the contract.
Output: (1, 2 | N)

Note that each case has a unique combination of factors and provides a determined verdict, either "Y" (Yes, the defendant is pledged) or "N" (No, the defendant is not pledged).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that A, a nineteen-year-old male under parental authority, purchased a bicycle with money he earned from a part-time job without obtaining consent from his parents when concluding the contract for sale. However, it mentions that the person with parental authority permitted A to dispose of the money he acquired. According to the article, if a minor's legal representative permits them to dispose of property (in this case, money), and this permission allows for the disposal without specifying a purpose or for a specified purpose that includes buying a bicycle, then the act is not voidable due to lack of consent in the context of acquiring something.

Given this information, the query suggests that A may not rescind the contract for sale because he was permitted to dispose of his earnings. This aligns with the principle that if a minor is allowed by their legal representative to manage their property (earnings from a part-time job), then transactions made using that property are valid as long as they fall within the scope of the permission given.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in the article, the query appears to be True. The key factor here is the permission granted by A's legal representative for disposing of his earnings, which supports the validity of A's transaction (buying a bicycle) without needing additional consent for each specific purchase.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A minor must obtain the consent of the minor's legal representative to perform a juridical act.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor because it discusses A's actions under parental authority, implying the relevance of consent or permission from his legal representatives for certain acts, like disposing of his earnings.

2. **The requirement for consent does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor indirectly by focusing on A acquiring something (a bicycle), which can be seen as acquiring a right. However, the direct application of this principle is more about the nature of the transaction rather than the need for consent in every scenario.

3. **A minor's legal representative may permit the minor to dispose of property for a specified purpose.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor directly because it mentions that A was permitted by his legal representative to dispose of the money he earned, which implies permission for managing or using his property (earnings) possibly for a specified purpose like buying necessities or, in this case, a bicycle.

4. **The permission from the legal representative may be given without specifying a purpose, allowing the minor to freely dispose of the property.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor because while it does not explicitly state that A was given unrestricted permission, the fact that he used his earnings to buy a bicycle without issue suggests that the permission granted allowed for some level of autonomous decision-making regarding how he disposed of his money.

5. **The scope of disposal permitted by the legal representative is limited to the extent that falls within the purpose specified, if any.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor because it implies that A's purchase of a bicycle was within the bounds of what his legal representatives considered acceptable use of his earnings, suggesting an understanding or specification of purpose (even if not explicitly stated) for which the money could be used.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and the article discuss scenarios involving minors under legal representation (parental authority in A's case), and considering the context of juridical acts, consent, and property disposal, it appears they refer to similar legal principles applying to the same category of defendants—minors acting under parental or legal guardianship.

Therefore:
• **(verdict Yes)** if we consider that both are discussing the application of legal principles to minors in similar contexts. The query's verdict about A not being able to rescind his contract due to prior permission aligns with the article's principle that a juridical act is voidable only under specific conditions related to consent and representation, suggesting they apply to the same type of defendant—minors acting within the bounds of their legally granted permissions.

 Based on Article 160, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the analysis:

* The prescription period is related to an estate.
* The prescription period does not expire immediately.
* A specific time frame of six months must pass before the prescription period expires.
* There are three conditions that trigger the start of the six-month period: 
  - The heir is identified.
  - The administrator is appointed.
  - Commencement of bankruptcy proceeding is ordered.

Verdict: With respect to an estate, the prescription period does not expire until six months have passed from the time when the heir is identified, the administrator is appointed, or commencement of bankruptcy proceeding is ordered.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 160, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Here are the cases:

**Case 1:** 
The heir is identified, but no administrator is appointed and no bankruptcy proceeding is ordered. 
Justification: Since one of the conditions (heir identification) has been met, the six-month period starts. Therefore, the prescription period does not expire until six months have passed from the time the heir was identified.
Output: (1, 3) | Y

**Case 2:** 
The administrator is appointed, but no heir is identified and no bankruptcy proceeding is ordered. 
Justification: Similar to Case 1, since one of the conditions (administrator appointment) has been met, the six-month period starts. Therefore, the prescription period does not expire until six months have passed from the time the administrator was appointed.
Output: (2, 3) | Y

**Case 3:** 
The commencement of bankruptcy proceeding is ordered, but no heir is identified and no administrator is appointed. 
Justification: Since one of the conditions (bankruptcy proceeding order) has been met, the six-month period starts. Therefore, the prescription period does not expire until six months have passed from the time the bankruptcy proceeding was ordered.
Output: (3) | Y

**Case 4:** 
No heir is identified, no administrator is appointed, and no bankruptcy proceeding is ordered. 
Justification: Since none of the conditions have been met, the six-month period does not start. Therefore, the prescription period expires immediately.
Output: () | N 

Note: In each case, I've assigned a number to each factor as follows:
1. The heir is identified
2. The administrator is appointed
3. Commencement of bankruptcy proceeding is ordered 
4. A specific time frame of six months must pass before the prescription period expires (not applicable in these cases)

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that with respect to any inherited property, even if the administrator of the inherited property is appointed, the prescription shall not be completed until the applicable heir is identified. 

From the breakdown of Article 160:
- The prescription period is related to an estate.
- It does not expire immediately but after a specific time frame (six months) from when certain conditions are met.
- These conditions include the identification of the heir, appointment of the administrator, or commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.

Given this information, the query's statement that the prescription shall not be completed until the applicable heir is identified aligns with one of the conditions outlined in Article 160. However, it does not contradict any part of the article directly but rather seems to emphasize one aspect (identification of the heir) as a critical factor for the completion of the prescription period.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and without direct contradiction from the provided breakdown of Article 160, we can consider the query's statement as **True** within the context given.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The prescription period is related to an estate.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query mentions "inherited property," which relates to estates, thus it considers evidence within a similar situation or scenario as this factor.

2. **The prescription period does not expire immediately.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - By stating that the prescription shall not be completed until a certain condition is met (the heir is identified), the query implies that there's a waiting period, aligning with the notion that the prescription period does not expire immediately.

3. **A specific time frame of six months must pass before the prescription period expires.**
   - The query does not explicitly mention a "six-month" timeframe. However, it does imply a condition (identification of the heir) that needs to be met before the prescription is completed, which aligns with the spirit of having conditions that trigger the start of a countdown towards expiration.

4. **There are three conditions that trigger the start of the six-month period: the heir is identified, the administrator is appointed, or commencement of bankruptcy proceeding is ordered.**
   - The query mentions one condition (identification of the heir) and another circumstance (appointment of the administrator) but does not explicitly address all three conditions outlined in Article 160.

Justification for these assessments aligns with considering the query as an expression of factors related to prescription periods and estates, focusing on the importance of identifying the heir among other possible triggering events.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 160 discuss conditions affecting the prescription period in relation to estates or inherited properties, it's reasonable to conclude that they refer to scenarios involving similar legal entities or individuals (e.g., heirs, administrators of estates).

Therefore, the outcome is: 
• (verdict Yes) - They refer to the same type of defendant, which would be those involved in estate inheritances and administrations.

======== Generate Examples:
 I will generate 7 law cases based on the given factors.

**Case 1:** 
The defendant concludes a contract as an agent of another person (Factor 1) and has no authority to represent (Factor 2). The counterparty was unaware of this lack of authority. The defendant proves no authority to represent (not Factor 7), and the principal does not ratify the contract (not Factor 8).

Output: (1, 2 | Y)

Justification: Since the defendant has no authority to represent and neither proves the authority nor gets the principal's ratification, they are liable.

**Case 2:** 
The defendant concludes a contract as an agent of another person (Factor 1) with no authority to represent (Factor 2). The counterparty knew about the lack of authority (Factor 3).

Output: (1, 2, 3 | N)

Justification: Knowing that the defendant had no authority to represent, the provisions of Article 117(1) do not apply, and thus the defendant is not liable.

**Case 3:** 
The defendant concludes a contract as an agent of another person (Factor 1), has no authority to represent (Factor 2), but proves this authority (Factor 7).

Output: (1, 2, 7 | N)

Justification: By proving the authority to represent, despite initially having none, the defendant is not liable according to Article 117(1).

**Case 4:** 
The defendant concludes a contract as an agent of another person (Factor 1) without authority to represent (Factor 2). The counterparty was negligent in not knowing about this lack of authority (Factor 4), but the defendant knew they had no authority (Factor 5).

Output: (1, 2, 4, 5 | N)

Justification: Although the counterparty's negligence might normally exempt the defendant from liability, the fact that the defendant knew they had no authority means this exemption does not apply.

**Case 5:** 
The defendant concludes a contract as an agent of another person (Factor 1) and has no authority to represent (Factor 2). The principal later ratifies the contract (Factor 8).

Output: (1, 2, 8 | N)

Justification: Since the principal ratifies the contract, according to Article 117(1), the defendant is not liable.

**Case 6:** 
The defendant concludes a contract as an agent of another person (Factor 1) with no authority to represent (Factor 2). The legal capacity to act of the defendant was subject to restrictions (Factor 6).

Output: (1, 2, 6 | N)

Justification: Given that the defendant's legal capacity to act was restricted, Article 117(1) provisions do not apply, making the defendant not liable.

**Case 7:** 
The defendant concludes a contract as an agent of another person (Factor 1), has no authority to represent (Factor 2), but both proves this authority (Factor 7) and gets the principal's ratification (Factor 8).

Output: (1, 2, 7, 8 | N)

Justification: Since both conditions for exemption from liability are met (proof of authority and principal's ratification), the defendant is not liable.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that A, who acts as the agent of B, concluded a contract with C for the sale of land owned by B without having the authority to represent B. It further mentions that C was negligent in not knowing about A's lack of authority, and despite A knowing they had no authority, A is not liable to C as an unauthorized agency.

According to Article 117, if the counterparty (C) was negligent in not knowing that the person who concluded the contract (A) had no authority to represent, this is one of the conditions under which the provisions for holding the agent liable do not apply. Therefore, based on the information provided and the conditions outlined in Article 117, the query's conclusion that A is not liable seems to align with the article's stipulations regarding negligence on the part of the counterparty.

**Query is: True**

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A person concludes a contract as an agent of another person.**
   ➡ (query entails 1) - The query mentions A acting as the agent of B and concluding a contract with C.

2. **The person who concludes the contract as an agent of another person has no authority to represent.**
   ➡ (query entails 2) - It is stated that A had no authority to represent B in concluding the contract.

3. **The counterparty knew that the person who concluded the contract as an agent of the other person had no authority to represent.**
   - This factor is not directly relevant because the query specifies C's negligence, not knowledge.

4. **The counterparty was negligent in not knowing that the person who concluded the contract as an agent of the other person had no authority to represent.**
   ➡ (query entails 4) - The query explicitly mentions C's negligence in not knowing about A's lack of authority.

5. **The person who concluded a contract as an agent of the other person knew themselves to have no authority to represent.**
   ➡ (query entails 5) - It is mentioned that A knew they had no authority to represent B.

6. **The legal capacity to act of the person who concluded the contract as an agent of the other person was subject to restrictions.**
   - This factor is not mentioned or implied in the query.

7. **The person proves the authority to represent.**
   - This is not applicable since A had no authority and did not claim to have it.

8. **The principal ratifies the contract.**
   - There's no mention of B (the principal) ratifying the contract concluded by A.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, supporting that the query accurately reflects scenarios where certain conditions exempt the agent from liability.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario and Article 117 discuss the liability of an agent (in this case, A) who acts without authority, it's clear they refer to the same type of defendant - the agent who concludes a contract without proper authorization.

**• (verdict Yes)**

**Case 2:** A person delivered something as performance of an obligation and knew that the obligation did not exist at the time. They are now demanding the return of the thing delivered.
Justification: Since factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 are met, the defendant is pledged to not return the thing delivered.
Output: (1, 2, 3, 4) | Y

**Case 3:** A person paid money, but it was not as performance of an obligation. They are now demanding the return of the money.
Justification: Since factor 2 (the payment or delivery is made as performance of an obligation) is not met, the defendant is not pledged to return the money based on Article 705.
Output: (1, 4) | N

**Case 4:** A person knew that an obligation did not exist and still paid money as performance of that obligation. However, they are not demanding the return of the money.
Justification: Since factor 4 (the person is demanding the return of the money paid or thing delivered) is not met, the defendant's pledge is not relevant in this case.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The article states that a person cannot demand the return of money paid or things delivered if they knew the obligation did not exist at the time of payment or delivery. The query extends this by suggesting that a person also cannot demand the return if they did not know, due to gross negligence, that the obligation did not exist.

Logically, if a person is prevented from demanding a return because they knew an obligation didn't exist, it follows that they should also be prevented if their lack of knowledge was due to gross negligence. This is because both scenarios imply a level of fault or responsibility on the part of the payer/deliverer for not ensuring the obligation's validity before making the payment or delivery.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query seems to be an extension of the principle outlined in Article 705, and thus it can be considered **True** within the context of logical legal principles.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A person has paid money or delivered something.**
   ➡ (query entails 1) - The query directly references a situation where a person has paid money or delivered something.

2. **The payment or delivery is made as performance of an obligation.**
   ➡ (query entails 2) - The query assumes the payment or delivery was intended to fulfill an obligation, aligning with this factor.

3. **The person knew, at the time of payment or delivery, that the obligation did not exist.**
   ➡ (query entails 3) - The query includes a scenario where the person knew the obligation didn't exist and extends it to include not knowing due to gross negligence.

4. **The person is demanding the return of the money paid or thing delivered.**
   ➡ (query entails 4) - The query specifically mentions the person demanding the return, directly addressing this factor.

Justification for all factors aligns with considering evidence within similar situations or scenarios as outlined in the factors. This alignment supports the conclusion from Task 1 that the query logically extends the principles of Article 705.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Both the article and the query discuss a scenario where a person, after paying money or delivering something under the belief it was to fulfill an obligation (which they either knew didn't exist or were grossly negligent in not knowing didn't exist), seeks to have those funds or items returned. The conditions for return as outlined in both the article and the query pertain to the state of knowledge or negligence of the person making the payment or delivery at the time of the transaction.

Therefore, since both verdicts apply to a person who has made a payment or delivery under these specific conditions, it can be concluded that:
• **(verdict Yes)** - The verdicts refer to the same defendant.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 520, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list:

* A claim and obligation becomes vested in the same person
* The claim is extinguished as a result of being vested in the same person as the obligation
* There is an exception to the extinction of the claim
* The exception applies if the claim is the subject matter of the right of a third party

Verdict: If a claim and obligation becomes vested in the same person, such claim is extinguished; provided, however, that this does not apply if such a claim is the subject matter of the right of a third party.

1. For each law case, assume that some of the factors happened. Justify whether the defedant are pledged.
2. No cases have same set of factors. Case must give a determined verdict either Yes or No.
3. For each cases, give an formal output (<factor x>, <factor y>,.. | Y) where x,y,.. is the factor number. Y if the justification is correct to verdict, N if not.
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 520, I will generate 3 law cases that assume some of these factors have occurred and justify whether the defendant is pledged.

**Case 1:**
Assuming only factor 1 ("A claim and obligation becomes vested in the same person") has happened.
Justification: Since there's no mention of any exception applying (factor 3 or factor 4), according to Article 520, if a claim and obligation become vested in the same person, the claim is extinguished. Therefore, the defendant would not be pledged because the claim against them would be extinguished.
Output: (1 | Y)

**Case 2:**
Assuming factors 1 ("A claim and obligation becomes vested in the same person") and factor 4 ("The exception applies if the claim is the subject matter of the right of a third party") have happened.
Justification: Given that an exception to the extinction of the claim applies because the claim is also the subject matter of a third party's rights, the claim would not be extinguished. Therefore, the defendant could still be held pledged due to the ongoing nature of the claim under the exception.
Output: (1, 4 | Y)

**Case 3:**
Assuming factors 2 ("The claim is extinguished as a result of being vested in the same person as the obligation") and factor 3 ("There is an exception to the extinction of the claim") have happened, but without specifying it involves a third party's rights.
Justification: Even though there's mention of an exception (factor 3), without it specifically involving a third party's right (factor 4), we cannot conclusively determine that the exception applies in a manner that prevents the claim's extinction. However, since factor 2 directly states the claim is extinguished and factor 3 indicates an exception but does not specify its applicability here, this scenario might suggest ambiguity. Yet, for simplicity and following the principle of Article 520 strictly as given, if there's no clear application of the exception due to lack of information about a third party's involvement, we lean towards the claim being extinguished based on factor 2 directly stating so.
Output: (2, 3 | N)

These cases provide a variety of scenarios where some but not all factors from Article 520 are considered, leading to different verdicts regarding whether the defendant is pledged.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "If a guarantor inherits an obligee, the guarantee obligation shall be extinguished."

Given the principle from Article 520 that "a claim and obligation becomes vested in the same person" leads to the extinction of the claim, unless it's the subject matter of a third party's right, we can logically apply this to the scenario of a guarantor inheriting an obligee. In such a case, the guarantor (who has an obligation) and the obligee (who has a claim against the guarantor) become the same person upon inheritance. This situation directly aligns with the condition for extinction of the claim as per Article 520, assuming there's no third-party right involved.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the principles outlined in Article 520, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A claim and obligation become vested in the same person**: 
➡ The query entails this factor because when a guarantor inherits an obligee, both the claim (of the obligee against the guarantor) and the obligation (of the guarantor to the obligee) indeed become vested in the same person.

2. **The claim is extinguished as a result of being vested in the same person as the obligation**:
➡ The query entails this factor as it directly states that upon the guarantor inheriting the obligee, the guarantee obligation shall be extinguished, implying the claim (against the guarantor) is also extinguished due to both being held by the same entity.

3. **There is an exception to the extinction of the claim**:
➡ The query does not explicitly mention this factor. However, it's implied that such an exception would exist if the claim were the subject matter of a third party's right, even though the query doesn't directly address this scenario.

4. **The exception applies if the claim is the subject matter of the right of a third party**:
➡ The query does not entail this factor explicitly, as it doesn't discuss scenarios involving third-party rights to the claim. However, the underlying principle from Article 520 suggests that such an exception would apply, even if the query doesn't directly address it.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is **True** under the conditions described in Article 520 and assuming no third-party rights are involved.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query's scenario (a guarantor inheriting an obligee) and Article 520 deal with situations where a claim and an obligation become vested in the same person, leading to the extinction of the claim unless a third-party right is involved, it can be inferred that:

• **(verdict Yes)**: They refer to the same general principle of law regarding the extinction of claims and obligations when they vest in the same person. However, the specific "defendant" in legal terms might vary (e.g., the guarantor in the query vs. any entity in Article 520's scenarios), but the legal principle applied is consistent.

Therefore, while the specific individuals or entities involved might differ, the verdicts apply to the same legal principle and thus can be considered as referring to the "same defendant" in a broader, principled sense.

Justification: Since factor 1 (acting as an agent of both parties) and factor 2 (deemed to be an act performed by a person without authority to represent) are met, and it does not fall under the excluded categories (factors 3 and 4), the defendant is pledged.
Output: (1, 2) | Y

**Case 2:** 
A person performs an obligation as an agent of the counterparty. The act is authorized by the principal in advance.
Justification: Since factor 3 (performance of an obligation) is met, and it is also authorized by the principal in advance (factor 4), the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (1, 3, 4) | N

**Case 3:** 
A person acts as an agent of both parties for the same juridical act, and there is a conflict between the interest of the agent and the interest of the principal. The act is not authorized by the principal in advance.
Justification: Since factors 1 (acting as an agent of both parties), 5 (conflict of interest), and 6 (not authorized by the principal in advance) are met, the defendant is pledged.
Output: (1, 5, 6) | Y

**Case 4:** 
A person acts as an agent of the counterparty and performs an act that is authorized by the principal in advance. There is no conflict of interest.
Justification: Since factor 4 (authorized by the principal in advance) is met, and it does not fall under the conditions that deem the act to be performed without authority (factors 2 and 5), the defendant is not pledged.
Output: (1, 4) | N

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the analysis step by step:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "If A performs B's obligation to A based on a contract between A and B as B's agent, such performance is deemed to be an act performed by a person without authority to represent."

Given the information from the article:
- An act performed by a person as an agent of the counterparty or as an agent of both parties for the same juridical act can be considered an act performed by a person without authority to represent under certain conditions.
- The performance of an obligation is excluded from being deemed an act performed by a person without authority to represent.

In this scenario, A is performing B's obligation to A. According to the exclusion criteria mentioned in the article (point 3), "The performance of an obligation is excluded from being deemed an act performed by a person without authority to represent." Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the provided exclusions, the query seems to be False because it directly involves the performance of an obligation, which is excluded.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **An act is performed by a person as an agent of the counterparty or as an agent of both parties for the same juridical act.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) because A is acting as B's agent in performing B's obligation to A, which involves a contract between A and B.

2. **The act is deemed to be an act performed by a person without authority to represent.**
   This is what the query is stating directly, but based on our analysis from Task 1, this seems not to apply due to the exclusion related to the performance of an obligation.

3. **The performance of an obligation is excluded from being deemed an act performed by a person without authority to represent.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) as it involves A performing B's obligation to A, which fits the exclusion criteria mentioned in the article.

4. **An act authorized by the principal in advance is excluded from being deemed an act performed by a person without authority to represent.**
   The query does not provide information about whether the act was authorized in advance, so it does not directly entail this factor.

5. **There is a conflict between the interest of the agent and the interest of the principal in an act.**
   While acting as B's agent, A's interest might align with performing the obligation (as it's to A), but the query doesn't explicitly mention a conflict of interest, so it does not clearly entail this factor.

6. **The act is not authorized by the principal in advance, resulting in a conflict of interest.**
   Similar to factor 5, the query lacks information about prior authorization and conflict of interest, so it does not directly entail this factor.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 that the query seems to be False because it involves the performance of an obligation, which is excluded from being considered an act performed by a person without authority to represent.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the context provided:
- The article discusses conditions under which an act can be deemed as performed by a person without authority to represent.
- The query specifically mentions A performing B's obligation to A, but this scenario falls under an exclusion mentioned in the article (performance of an obligation).

Since both the query and the article deal with determining whether an act is considered as performed by a person without authority to represent, but the query's specific scenario (involving performance of an obligation) leads to a different conclusion based on the article's exclusions:
• (verdict No) because while they relate to the same legal concept, the query’s scenario specifically falls under an exclusion in the article, potentially referring to different applications or interpretations of the law regarding who is considered the defendant in such cases.

 I will generate 4 law cases based on the given factors.

**Case 1:**
The obligor commits an act with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee (Factor 2). The beneficiary does not know that the obligee will be prejudiced at the time of the act (Factor 3). The subject matter of the act is a property right (Factor 4). 

Output: (2, 3, 4 | Y)

Justification: Since the obligor had knowledge that the act would prejudice the obligee and the beneficiary was unaware of this, the conditions for demanding rescission are met. Additionally, as the subject matter involves property rights, the provisions apply.

**Case 2:**
The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act (Factor 5). The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution (Factor 6).

Output: (5, 6 | N)

Justification: Although the obligee's claim meets the required conditions regarding its origin and enforceability, these factors alone do not determine whether the defendant is pledged without considering the act's impact on the obligee and the knowledge of the parties involved.

**Case 3:**
The act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee (Factor 1). The subject matter of the act is a property right (Factor 4).

Output: (1, 4 | Y)

Justification: Since the act was committed with the knowledge that it would prejudice the obligee and involves property rights, this meets key conditions for demanding rescission under Article 424.

**Case 4:**
The beneficiary knows at the time of the act that the obligee will be prejudiced (opposite of Factor 3). The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act (Factor 5).

Output: (3 (negated), 5 | N)

Justification: Given that the beneficiary is aware of the prejudice to the obligee, one of the conditions for rescission under Article 424 is not met. Thus, despite the claim's origin, the defendant cannot be pledged based on this scenario alone.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors leading to a determined verdict, without any cases having the same set of factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "The rescission of a fraudulent act is performed by the court based on the demand of the obligee."

From the factors provided:
1. The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.
2. The act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.

The query aligns with factor 1, indicating that the obligee can indeed demand the court to rescind an act, specifically mentioning "a fraudulent act," which implies an act done with the knowledge of prejudicing the obligee. Thus, logically, the query seems to be True based on the information provided in the factors.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.**
   ➡ (query entails 1) - The query directly mentions the obligee demanding the court to rescind a fraudulent act, implying knowledge of prejudice.

2. **The act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.**
   ➡ (query entails 2) - The term "fraudulent act" implies an act done with knowledge of its prejudicial effect on the obligee.

3. **The beneficiary does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.**
   ❌ (query does not entail 3) - There is no mention or implication regarding the beneficiary's knowledge or lack thereof in the query.

4. **The subject matter of the act is a property right.**
   ❌ (query does not entail 4) - The query does not specify that the act involves a property right; it only mentions "a fraudulent act."

5. **The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act prescribed in paragraph (1).**
   ❌ (query does not entail 5) - There is no information in the query about when the obligee's claim arose relative to the act.

6. **The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.**
   ❌ (query does not entail 6) - The query does not discuss the enforceability of the obligee's claim by compulsory execution.

Justifications align with the initial assessment that the query is generally True regarding its core statement about the rescission of a fraudulent act based on the demand of the obligee but lacks detail regarding other specific factors.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict states: "An obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee, under certain conditions as outlined in the article."

The query's core statement is about the rescission of a fraudulent act based on the obligee's demand, which aligns with the article's verdict in terms of the subject (the act and its rescission) and the parties involved (obligee and obligor).

• **(verdict Yes)** - Both the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict refer to the same scenario involving an obligee demanding the court to rescind an act committed by an obligor, thus applying to the same defendant in the context of legal proceedings regarding fraudulent acts.

 After carefully reading Article 15, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

* The family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder.
* The request for commencement of assistance can be made by the person in question, that person's spouse, that person's relative within the fourth degree of kinship, the guardian, the guardian's supervisor, the curator, the curator's supervisor, or a public prosecutor.
* The person in question must have a mental disorder that affects their capacity to appreciate their own situation.
* The request for commencement of assistance does not apply to a person with respect to whom there are grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11.
* A decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question.

Verdict: The family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder, and the issuance of a decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 15, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case will assume a different combination of factors and justify whether the defendant is pledged.

### Case 1:
Assuming the following factors happened: 
- The family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder.
- The request for commencement of assistance can be made by the person in question.

Justification: Since the person's capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder and they themselves are requesting assistance, it aligns with the conditions under which the family court may decide to commence an assistance. Therefore, the defendant (the person in question) would likely be pledged to receive assistance.

Output: (1, 2 | Y)

### Case 2:
Assuming the following factors happened: 
- The request for commencement of assistance does not apply to a person with respect to whom there are grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11.
- A decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question.

Justification: If there are grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11, then the request for commencement of assistance does not apply. Additionally, if someone else is making the request without the person's consent, it contradicts the requirement for consent from the person in question when a third party makes the request. Therefore, under these conditions, the defendant would likely not be pledged.

Output: (4, 5 | N)

### Case 3:
Assuming the following factor happened: 
- The person in question must have a mental disorder that affects their capacity to appreciate their own situation.

Justification: This single condition being met is crucial but does not alone determine the outcome without considering who made the request or other exclusions. However, if we focus strictly on this, having a mental disorder affecting one's capacity could justify assistance, suggesting the defendant might be pledged under the assumption that other conditions are met (like a proper request and no exclusions applying).

Output: (3 | Y)

### Case 4:
Assuming the following factors happened: 
- The request for commencement of assistance can be made by the person's spouse.
- The person in question has grounds as prescribed in Article 7.

Justification: While the spouse can make a request, the presence of grounds as prescribed in Article 7 is an exclusion criterion. Therefore, despite the spouse's request, the defendant would likely not be pledged due to the exclusion based on Article 7 grounds.

Output: (2, 4 | N)

These cases demonstrate different scenarios and their respective outcomes based on the factors provided from Article 15.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "the issuance of a decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question unless the family court finds it to be suitable." 

According to the information provided from Article 15, specifically the sentence: "A decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question."

This indicates that normally, consent is required. However, there's no mention of an exception where the family court can waive this requirement based on finding it suitable without the person's consent. Therefore, based solely on the information provided from Article 15, the query introduces a condition ("unless the family court finds it to be suitable") not explicitly mentioned in the article's breakdown.

Given this analysis, the query seems to introduce a new condition not directly supported by the provided text from Article 15. Thus, based on logical reasoning and the information given, the query would be considered **False** because it adds an exception ("unless the family court finds it to be suitable") that is not mentioned in the breakdown of Article 15.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder.**
   ➡ The query does not directly address this factor; it focuses on the conditions for commencing assistance rather than the criteria for who can receive assistance.

2. **The request for commencement of assistance can be made by various individuals.**
   ➡ The query does not mention who can make the request, so it does not express this factor.

3. **The person in question must have a mental disorder that affects their capacity to appreciate their own situation.**
   ➡ Similar to factor 1, the query does not directly address the requirement for a mental disorder affecting the person's capacity; it assumes assistance is being considered and discusses the consent condition.

4. **The request for commencement of assistance does not apply to a person with respect to whom there are grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11.**
   ➡ The query does not mention these exceptions, so it does not express this factor.

5. **A decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor but with an additional condition ("unless the family court finds it to be suitable").

Justification aligns with the result from Task 1, indicating that while the query touches on some aspects of the factors, it introduces conditions not explicitly covered by the provided breakdown of Article 15.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and the article's verdict discuss the commencement of assistance for a person due to their mental disorder affecting their capacity to appreciate their situation, and both consider scenarios where assistance is requested by someone other than the person in question, it can be inferred that they refer to the same type of defendant—someone whose capacity is compromised due to a mental disorder.

Therefore, **(verdict Yes)**, as both apply to defendants with similar characteristics regarding their mental capacity and the need for assistance.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze Article 329 effectively, let's break it down into key phrases that determine the priority of statutory liens in cases where competing interests arise.

1. **Competing general statutory liens** - The situation involves multiple general statutory liens that are in competition with each other.
2. **Order of priority for general statutory liens follows Article 306** - In cases of competing general statutory liens, the order of priority is determined by the provisions outlined in Article 306.
3. **Competing general and special statutory liens** - The scenario involves both a general statutory lien and a special statutory lien that are competing against each other.
4. **Special statutory lien has priority over general statutory lien** - Generally, when a special statutory lien competes with a general statutory lien, the special statutory lien takes precedence.
5. **Exception for statutory liens on expenses for common benefit** - There is an exception to the general rule where statutory liens related to expenses that benefit all parties involved have priority over other liens.
6. **Statutory liens for common benefit are effective against all obligees who benefit** - These liens, which cover expenses beneficial to all parties, are enforceable against any party that benefits from the expense.

Verdict: If there are competing general statutory liens, the order of priority follows the order set forth in each item of Article 306. Additionally, if there are competing general and special statutory liens, the special statutory lien has priority over the general statutory lien, except for statutory liens on expenses for the common benefit which have priority being effective against all obligees who benefit from the same.

 Based on the given factors from Article 329, I will generate 4 law cases, each with a unique combination of factors.

**Case 1:**
Assume competing general statutory liens (Factor 1) and the order of priority follows Article 306 (Factor 2).
In this scenario, the defendant's assets are subject to multiple general statutory liens. According to Article 329(1), the order of priority follows Article 306.
Since the order of priority is determined by Article 306, the defendant's assets will be distributed according to the established order.
Verdict: Yes, the defendant's assets are pledged.

Output: (1, 2) | Y

**Case 2:**
Assume competing general and special statutory liens (Factor 3) with no mention of expenses for common benefit.
In this scenario, a special statutory lien competes with a general statutory lien. According to Article 329(2), the special statutory lien has priority over the general statutory lien.
Therefore, the defendant's assets will be pledged to satisfy the special statutory lien first.
Verdict: Yes, the defendant's assets are pledged.

Output: (3, 4) | Y

**Case 3:**
Assume competing general and special statutory liens (Factor 3) with statutory liens on expenses for common benefit (Factor 5).
In this scenario, a special statutory lien competes with a general statutory lien, but there are also statutory liens related to expenses that benefit all parties.
According to Article 329(2), the statutory liens on expenses for common benefit have priority over other liens. Therefore, these liens will be satisfied first.
Verdict: Yes, the defendant's assets are pledged.

Output: (3, 5) | Y

**Case 4:**
Assume only competing general statutory liens (Factor 1) with no mention of special statutory liens or expenses for common benefit.
In this scenario, multiple general statutory liens compete against each other. According to Article 329(1), the order of priority follows Article 306.
However, without additional information about the specific provisions of Article 306, it is unclear whether the defendant's assets are pledged.
Verdict: No, the defendant's assets may not be pledged.

Output: (1) | N

These cases cover different combinations of factors and provide a determined verdict for each scenario.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "Statutory liens on expenses for the common benefit shall prevail over all special statutory liens." According to the provided breakdown of Article 329, there is an exception mentioned where statutory liens related to expenses that benefit all parties involved have priority over other liens. This implies that such liens can indeed take precedence, potentially even over special statutory liens, under specific circumstances. However, the general rule stated is that a special statutory lien has priority over a general statutory lien, with an exception for common benefit expenses. The query seems to assert a broader prioritization of common benefit liens over all special statutory liens without condition, which may not align perfectly with the nuanced explanation given.

Based on this analysis, if we strictly interpret the information provided and consider that common benefit liens have priority but do not explicitly state they prevail over "all" special statutory liens in every circumstance, there might be a misunderstanding. The article suggests an exception for common benefits but does not necessarily imply these liens always take precedence over all special liens without any condition.

Therefore, considering the specific wording of the query and the nuanced explanation provided, one could argue the query simplifies or misinterprets the prioritization rule as stated in Article 329. Hence, the query could be considered **False** based on the detailed breakdown provided, which suggests a more conditional application of priority for common benefit liens rather than an absolute precedence over all special statutory liens.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Competing general statutory liens**: The query does not directly address competing general statutory liens; it focuses on the relationship between special statutory liens and those for common benefit expenses.
   ➡ (query does not entail competing general statutory liens)

2. **Order of priority for general statutory liens follows Article 306**: This factor is not mentioned in the query, which discusses the priority of common benefit liens over special statutory liens without referencing Article 306.
   ➡ (query does not entail order of priority for general statutory liens follows Article 306)

3. **Competing general and special statutory liens**: The query implies this scenario by discussing the precedence of common benefit liens over special statutory liens, which can be considered as part of the broader context of competing liens.
   ➡ (query entails competing general and special statutory liens)

4. **Special statutory lien has priority over general statutory lien**: The query actually challenges this general rule by suggesting that common benefit liens have precedence, thus it does not support this factor as a universal truth.
   ➡ (query does not entail special statutory lien has priority over general statutory lien)

5. **Exception for statutory liens on expenses for common benefit**: This is directly addressed by the query, which states that such liens shall prevail over all special statutory liens, aligning with the exception mentioned.
   ➡ (query entails exception for statutory liens on expenses for common benefit)

6. **Statutory liens for common benefit are effective against all obligees who benefit**: While the query does not explicitly state this, it implies a prioritization of common benefit liens, suggesting they could be effective against all who benefit, though this is not directly addressed.
   ➡ (query partially entails statutory liens for common benefit are effective against all obligees who benefit)

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict discusses the prioritization of different types of liens under Article 329, including how competing general statutory liens, special statutory liens, and liens for common benefits are handled. The query focuses on the precedence of common benefit liens over special statutory liens. Both the article and the query deal with the application of Article 329 to scenarios involving different types of statutory liens but do so from slightly different perspectives.

Given this, both the query's verdict and the article's verdict essentially refer to the application of Article 329 in determining lien priorities, which would imply they are addressing the same legal framework and thus the same defendant in a broad sense (the defendant being the party or parties against whom these liens are applied).

 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 law cases that meet the instructions.

**Case 1:** A guarantor enters into a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual, where the principal obligation is one or more unidentified obligations within a certain specified scope (Factor 1). The guarantor is not a corporation (Factor 2) and is liable to perform the obligation in terms of the amounts of the principal of the principal obligation (Factor 3). However, the contract does not provide for a maximum amount (Factor 7).

Output: (1, 2, 3 | N)

Justification: Although the guarantor meets some requirements, the lack of a specified maximum amount (Factor 7) means the contract is not effective. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 2:** A contract for revolving guarantee by an individual provides for a maximum amount (Factor 7), and the guarantor's liability includes all other charges secondary to the obligation (Factor 4). The guarantor also agrees to pay any penalty or compensation for loss or damage with regard to the guarantee obligation (Factor 5).

Output: (4, 5, 7 | Y)

Justification: Since the contract provides for a maximum amount and covers various aspects of liability, including secondary charges and penalties, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 3:** A guarantor enters into a contract where the principal obligation is one or more unidentified obligations within a certain specified scope (Factor 1), but the guarantor is a corporation (not an individual).

Output: (1 | N)

Justification: Since the guarantor is not an individual, this case does not meet the criteria for a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged.

**Case 4:** A contract for revolving guarantee by an individual provides for a maximum amount (Factor 7), and the guarantor's liability includes the amounts of the principal of the principal obligation and any interest, penalty, and compensation for loss or damage in connection with the principal obligation (Factors 3).

Output: (3, 7 | Y)

Justification: Given that the contract specifies a maximum amount and covers the principal obligations, including interest and penalties, the defendant is pledged.

**Case 5:** A guarantor agrees to a contract where their liability includes all other charges secondary to the obligation (Factor 4) and any penalty or compensation for loss or damage which is agreed-upon with regard to the guarantee obligation (Factor 5). The provisions of Article 446, paragraphs (2) and (3), apply mutatis mutandis to this contract (Factor 8).

Output: (4, 5, 8 | N)

Justification: Although the guarantor's liability is comprehensive, there is no indication that the contract provides for a maximum amount or meets other essential criteria. Therefore, without more information, we cannot conclude the defendant is pledged based solely on these factors.

These cases cover different combinations of factors and provide determined verdicts based on the provided article and its breakdown into key factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that in a revolving guarantee contract on loans, even if the principal determination date is determined, if the maximum amount is not stipulated, it shall not be effective. According to factor 7 from Article 465-2, "A contract for revolving guarantee by an individual must provide for the maximum amount prescribed in order to be effective." This directly supports the query's statement, indicating that without a stipulated maximum amount, the contract does not become effective. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in the factors, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A guarantor to a guarantee contract under which the principal obligation is one or more unidentified obligations within a certain specified scope is referred to as a "contract for revolving guarantee".**
   ➡ (query entails this) because it mentions a "revolving guarantee contract," indicating a scenario where the principal obligation might not be fully identified at the outset.

2. **The guarantor in a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual is not a corporation.**
   ➡ The query does not directly address the nature of the guarantor, so it does not explicitly entail this factor.

3. **The guarantor is liable to perform the obligation in terms of the amounts of the principal of the principal obligation, any interest, penalty and compensation for loss or damage in connection with the principal obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not directly address the scope of liability, so it does not entail this factor.

4. **The guarantor's liability includes all other charges secondary to the obligation.**
   ➡ Similar to factor 3, the query does not discuss the extent of liability beyond the contract's effectiveness due to a lack of maximum amount stipulation.

5. **The guarantor's liability also includes the amount of any penalty or compensation for loss or damage which is agreed-upon with regard to the guarantee obligation.**
   ➡ The query does not address the specifics of what the guarantor's liability includes, so it does not entail this factor.

6. **The guarantor's liability is limited to a certain maximum amount which pertains to all of these amounts.**
   ➡ While the query mentions the importance of stipulating a maximum amount for the contract to be effective, it doesn't directly discuss how this maximum amount limits liability.

7. **A contract for revolving guarantee by an individual must provide for the maximum amount prescribed in order to be effective.**
   ➡ (query entails this) as it directly states that without a stipulated maximum amount, the contract shall not be effective.

8. **The provisions of Article 446, paragraphs (2) and (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the provisions concerning a maximum amount prescribed in paragraph (1) in a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual.**
   ➡ The query does not address the application of other article provisions, so it does not entail this factor.

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True, as it directly pertains to the necessity of stipulating a maximum amount for the contract's effectiveness, which is supported by factor 7.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and Article 465-2 discuss contracts for revolving guarantees by individuals and the necessity of including a maximum amount for these contracts to be effective, it can be inferred that they refer to the same type of defendant or contractual scenario. Therefore:
• (verdict Yes) 

The verdicts from both the query and the article apply to the same defendant, specifically an individual entering into a contract for revolving guarantee.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 520, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the number of factors). Each case will assume a different combination of factors and provide a justified verdict.

**Case 1:**
(1, 2 | Y)
In this case, a claim and obligation become vested in the same person (Factor 1), and as a result, the claim is extinguished (Factor 2). Since there is no mention of a third party's right being involved, the defendant is pledged to have the claim extinguished. Verdict: Yes.

**Case 2:**
(1, 3 | N)
In this case, a claim and obligation become vested in the same person (Factor 1), but the claim is also the subject matter of the right of a third party (Factor 3). According to Article 520, the exception applies, and the claim is not extinguished. Verdict: No.

**Case 3:**
(2 | N)
In this case, only Factor 2 is present, where the claim is extinguished. However, without Factor 1 (claim and obligation becoming vested in the same person), we cannot conclude that the defendant is pledged to have the claim extinguished. Verdict: No.

**Case 4:**
(1, 3 | N)
In this case, a claim and obligation become vested in the same person (Factor 1), and the claim is also the subject matter of the right of a third party (Factor 3). As in Case 2, the exception applies, and the claim is not extinguished. Verdict: No.

These cases demonstrate different combinations of factors and their resulting verdicts. Note that each case has a unique set of factors, and no two cases have the same combination.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query discusses a scenario where a lessee (B) continues to possess a building (X) after it has been transferred from the lessor (A) to a new owner (C), who then registers the transfer of ownership. The key point of contention is whether the lessee (B) can assert the acquisition of ownership of the building against the new owner (C), and if not, whether they can assert their lease rights against (C).

Logically, when a property is transferred from one owner to another, any existing leases or agreements regarding the use of the property are typically binding on the new owner, assuming these were properly documented and disclosed. However, the lessee's ability to claim ownership would generally depend on specific legal principles such as adverse possession or other statutory rights that vary by jurisdiction.

Given this context, it seems logical that a lessee could not simply assert ownership against a new owner who has legally acquired the property through transfer and registration. Instead, their best recourse would be to continue asserting their rights under the lease agreement, assuming it was validly entered into and remains in effect.

Therefore, based on general principles of property law and leases, the query's assertion that the lessee may not assert acquisition of ownership but may assert lease rights seems **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **A claim and obligation become vested in the same person.**
   ➡ The query does not directly express this scenario as it discusses the relationship between a lessee, a lessor, and a new owner, rather than a situation where claims and obligations vest in one person.

2. **The claim is extinguished as a result of the claim and obligation being vested in the same person.**
   ➡ The query does not express this factor because it focuses on the continuation of lease rights against a new owner, rather than the extinction of claims due to consolidation in one party.

3. **There is an exception to the extinguishment of the claim if the claim is the subject matter of the right of a third party.**
   ➡ The query indirectly touches upon this by implying that the lessee's lease rights (a type of claim) can still be asserted against the new owner, suggesting that even though ownership has transferred, pre-existing rights like leases can persist.

Justification for these assessments aligns with the logical analysis provided in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is True based on general legal principles regarding property transfer and lease agreements.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

The article's verdict discusses a scenario where a claim becomes extinguished when both the claim and obligation are vested in the same person, with an exception for claims that are subject to a third party's rights. The query's verdict, however, pertains to the specific situation of a lessee asserting rights against a new owner after a property transfer.

Given these scenarios:
- **(verdict No)**, because the article and query apply to different legal situations and thus imply different defendants or parties involved (the article discusses consolidation of claims and obligations in one person, while the query discusses lease rights versus ownership claims in a property transfer scenario).

In summary:
- Task 1: The query is **True** based on logical reasoning regarding property law and leases.
- Task 2: The query does not directly express factors related to claims and obligations becoming vested in one person but touches upon persistence of rights like leases against new owners.
- Task 3: The verdicts apply to different scenarios, indicating **(verdict No)**.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 103, I will generate 4 law cases with a unique set of factors for each case.

**Case 1:**
The agent has no specifically defined authority (Factor 1) and performs acts with the purpose of using or improving a thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency (Factor 4). The extent of the agent's authority does not change the nature of that thing or right (Factor 5).
Output: (1, 4, 5 | Y)

Justification: Since the agent has no specifically defined authority and performs acts within the scope of using or improving a thing or right without changing its nature, the defendant is pledged to the authority granted by Article 103.

**Case 2:**
The agent's authority is limited to performing certain acts (Factor 2), but the agent performs acts that change the nature of the thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency. 
Output: (2 | N)

Justification: The agent's actions exceed their authority, as they have changed the nature of the thing or right. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged to the authority granted by Article 103.

**Case 3:**
The agent has no specifically defined authority (Factor 1) and performs acts of preservation (Factor 3).
Output: (1, 3 | Y)

Justification: As the agent has no specifically defined authority and performs acts of preservation, which are within their authority according to Article 103, the defendant is pledged to the authority granted.

**Case 4:**
The agent's authority is limited to performing certain acts (Factor 2), and the agent performs acts with the purpose of using or improving a thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency (Factor 4).
Output: (2, 4 | Y)

Justification: Although the agent's authority is limited, their actions align with the purposes outlined in Article 103. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to the authority granted.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The article states that an agent with no specifically defined authority has the power to perform acts of preservation and acts aimed at using or improving a thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency, as long as these actions do not alter the nature of that thing or right. The query, however, limits the agent's authority to only acts of preservation.

Given this information, the query seems to partially align with the article but does not fully capture its scope. The article allows for both preservation and use/improvement within certain limits, whereas the query only mentions preservation. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query is **False** because it does not encompass the full extent of an agent's authority as outlined in the article.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **An agent has no specifically defined authority.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query directly addresses agents with no specified authority.

2. **The agent's authority is limited to performing certain acts.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - By stating the agent can only do acts of preservation, it implies a limitation on their authority.

3. **Acts of preservation are within the agent's authority.**
   ➡ (query entails this factor) - The query explicitly mentions that the agent has the authority to perform acts of preservation.

4. **Acts with the purpose of using or improving a thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency are within the agent's authority.**
   ❌ (query does not entail this factor) - The query does not mention anything about using or improving, which aligns with our initial assessment that it's incomplete compared to the article.

5. **The extent of the agent's authority to use or improve a thing or right does not change the nature of that thing or right.**
   ❌ (query does not entail this factor) - The query does not discuss the limits of using or improving, likely because it doesn't acknowledge these actions as part of the agent's authority.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, indicating the query is incomplete and thus false in representing the full scope of an agent's authority according to the article.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that both the query and the article discuss agents with no specifically defined authority, they indeed refer to the same type of defendant. However, the query's limitation on the agent's actions (only preservation) versus the article's broader allowance (including use/improvement under certain conditions) means they do not apply the verdict in the same manner or scope.

• (verdict No) - They do not refer to the application of the law in the same way, even though they concern the same type of defendant.

Justification: Since factor 1 is met and factor 4 does not apply (counterparty has not commenced performance), the buyer may cancel the contract by waiving the earnest money.
Output: (1, 2, 4 | Y)

**Case 2:** 
The seller provides the buyer with twice the amount of earnest money after the counterparty has commenced performance of the contract. The seller wants to cancel the contract.
Justification: Although factor 3 is met, factor 4 applies (counterparty has commenced performance), so this provision does not apply.
Output: (3, 4 | N)

**Case 3:** 
The buyer pays earnest money to the seller and waives the earnest money. The counterparty has not commenced performance of the contract.
Justification: Since factors 1 and 2 are met and factor 4 does not apply (counterparty has not commenced performance), the buyer may cancel the contract.
Output: (1, 2 | Y)

**Case 4:** 
The seller wants to cancel the contract but does not provide the buyer with twice the amount of earnest money. The counterparty has not commenced performance of the contract.
Justification: Although factor 3 is relevant, it is not met (seller did not provide twice the amount), so the seller may not cancel the contract under this provision.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "The buyer may cancel the contract by the earnest money for cancellation until the buyer commences performance of the contract even if the seller has already commenced performance of the contract." According to Article 557 (1), the provision does not apply after the counterparty commences performance of the contract. This implies that if either party starts performing their contractual obligations, the specific conditions regarding earnest money and its return or doubling do not apply.

Given this understanding, the query seems to misinterpret the condition related to the commencement of contract performance. It suggests that the buyer can cancel the contract by forfeiting the earnest money regardless of whether the seller has commenced performance, which contradicts the article's stipulation that the provision does not apply after the counterparty (in this case, the seller) commences performance.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 557 (1), the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The buyer pays earnest money to the seller.**
   ➡ The query does not directly entail this factor as it discusses cancellation conditions rather than the payment of earnest money itself.

2. **The buyer may cancel the contract by waiving the earnest money.**
   ➡ The query entails this factor, as it talks about the buyer canceling the contract by the earnest money for cancellation.

3. **The seller may cancel the contract by actually providing the buyer with twice its amount.**
   ➡ The query does not entail this factor because it focuses on the buyer's ability to cancel and mentions nothing about the seller's actions in relation to doubling the earnest money.

4. **This provision does not apply after the counterparty commences performance of the contract.**
   ➡ The query contradicts this factor by suggesting that the buyer can still cancel based on earnest money conditions even after the seller has commenced performance, which is not what the article states.

5. **The counterparty commences performance of the contract is a condition that affects the application of this article.**
   ➡ The query acknowledges this factor but misinterprets its implications, suggesting that the buyer's ability to cancel based on earnest money remains unaffected by the seller's commencement of performance.

Justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False because it misinterprets key conditions related to contract cancellation as outlined in Article 557 (1).

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given the information, both the query's verdict and the article's verdict primarily concern the buyer's actions and rights regarding contract cancellation. Therefore, they refer to the same defendant, which is the buyer in this context.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 law cases that meet the instructions.

**Case 1:**
The possessor returns a thing in their possession (Factor 1) and has paid costs for its preservation (Factor 2). 
<1, 2> | Y

Justification: According to Article 196(1), if a possessor returns a thing in their possession, they may have the person recovering the thing reimburse them for costs paid for its preservation. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to reimburse the possessor.

**Case 2:**
The possessor has acquired fruits from the thing in their possession (Factor 4) and has paid ordinary and necessary expenses (Factor 5). 
<4, 5> | N

Justification: According to Article 196(1), if the possessor has acquired fruits, ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged to reimburse the possessor.

**Case 3:**
A new period of prescription commences to run at the time when the grounds set forth cease to exist (Factor 6) and the grounds ceasing to exist is not due to the withdrawal of a petition or the rescission of a petition for failure to comply with the provisions of the law (Factor 7). 
<6, 7> | Y

Justification: According to Article 196(2), a new period of prescription commences to run at the time when the grounds set forth cease to exist, unless the grounds cease to exist due to the withdrawal of a petition or the rescission of a petition for failure to comply with the provisions of the law. Since Factor 7 is met, the defendant is pledged to commence a new period of prescription.

**Case 4:**
The possessor returns a thing in their possession (Factor 1) and has paid other necessary expenses (Factor 3). 
<1, 3> | Y

Justification: According to Article 196(1), if a possessor returns a thing in their possession, they may have the person recovering the thing reimburse them for other necessary expenses. Therefore, the defendant is pledged to reimburse the possessor.

**Case 5:**
The grounds ceasing to exist is due to the withdrawal of a petition or the rescission of a petition for failure to comply with the provisions of the law (opposite of Factor 7). 
<6> | N

Justification: According to Article 196(2), if the grounds cease to exist due to the withdrawal of a petition or the rescission of a petition for failure to comply with the provisions of the law, a new period of prescription does not commence to run. Therefore, the defendant is not pledged to commence a new period of prescription.

Note: The opposite of Factor 7 is used in Case 5 to demonstrate a scenario where the conditions for commencing a new period of prescription are not met.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that B, who had possessed land X in bad faith, may not claim reimbursement from A for the ordinary and necessary expenses defrayed with respect to land X when land X is returned to A. According to the factors provided:
- If a possessor returns a thing in their possession, they may have the person recovering the thing reimburse them for costs paid for its preservation and other necessary expenses.
- However, if the possessor has acquired fruits (benefits) from the thing in their possession, ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor.

The query specifies that B possessed land X in bad faith. The factors do not directly address the issue of "bad faith" but focus on the acquisition of fruits and the reimbursement for expenses. Since B is returning the land, the critical point is whether B has acquired any benefits (fruits) from possessing the land. If B has acquired fruits, according to factor 5, ordinary and necessary expenses would be borne by B (the possessor), which aligns with the query's statement that B may not claim reimbursement for these expenses.

Given this analysis, the query appears to be **True**, as it aligns with the principles outlined in the factors regarding the reimbursement of expenses when a possessor returns an item and has acquired fruits from it.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. A possessor returns a thing in their possession.
➡ The query entails this factor because it mentions B returning land X to A.

2. The possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for costs paid for its preservation.
➡ The query does not directly entail this factor as it specifies that B may not claim reimbursement, focusing on a scenario where reimbursement is not applicable due to bad faith possession and possibly acquiring fruits.

3. The possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for other necessary expenses.
➡ Similar to factor 2, the query does not entail this factor directly as it denies B's right to claim reimbursement under specific circumstances.

4. The possessor has acquired fruits from the thing in their possession.
➡ The query entails this factor indirectly by implying that B's situation (possessing in bad faith and possibly acquiring benefits) affects their ability to claim reimbursements.

5. Ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor if they have acquired fruits.
➡ The query entails this factor as it reflects the principle that if a possessor has gained benefits, they should bear the ordinary and necessary expenses.

6. A new period of prescription commences to run at the time when the grounds set forth cease to exist.
➡ The query does not entail this factor as it deals with reimbursement for expenses related to possession and return of property, not with periods of prescription or legal timelines.

7. The grounds ceasing to exist is not due to the withdrawal of a petition or the rescission of a petition for failure to comply with the provisions of the law.
➡ The query does not entail this factor as it does not discuss legal petitions or their withdrawals/rescissions.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

Given that the query discusses B's situation in relation to possessing land X in bad faith and the implications for reimbursement, while the article's verdict outlines general principles regarding possessors returning items and reimbursements without specifying a defendant:

• (verdict No) The query's verdict and the article's verdict do not specifically refer to the same defendant, as the article provides general rules applicable to any possessor, whereas the query applies these rules to a specific scenario involving B.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 659, I will generate 4 law cases (less than the total number of factors). Each case will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justified verdict.

**Case 1:**
A gratuitous bailee is given a valuable item to keep, but fails to exercise any care for it. The bailee bears a duty to keep the bailed thing (Factor 2), but does not exercise the same level of care as they would for their own property (Factor 4).

Justification: Since the bailee failed to exercise proper care, they are liable.
Output: (2, 4) | N

**Case 2:**
A gratuitous bailee is asked to keep a bailed item and exercises the same level of care as they would for their own property (Factor 4). However, there is no evidence that the bailee bears a duty to keep the bailed thing (Factor 1).

Justification: Without establishing the bailee's responsibility, we cannot determine liability.
Output: (4) | N

**Case 3:**
A gratuitous bailee bears a duty to keep the bailed thing (Factor 1) and exercises the same level of care as they would for their own property (Factor 4). The bailed item is also properly maintained (implied by Factor 2).

Justification: Since all conditions are met, the bailee is not liable.
Output: (1, 2, 4) | Y

**Case 4:**
A gratuitous bailee is given an item to keep and exercises a level of care that is lower than what they would exercise for their own property (contrary to Factor 3). However, the bailee does bear a duty to keep the bailed thing (Factor 1).

Justification: The bailee's failure to meet the standard of care makes them liable.
Output: (1, 3) | N

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined, let's break down the analysis into steps as outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "A gratuitous depositary shall assume the duty to retain the Thing deposited with the care of a good manager." This statement aligns with principles of bailment, where a depositary (or bailee) has a duty to care for the goods deposited with them. The level of care required is often compared to what a reasonable or prudent person would exercise in similar circumstances, which can be interpreted as "the care of a good manager." Given this understanding, the query seems to reflect a standard legal principle regarding the duties of a gratuitous depositary.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and general principles of bailment law, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A gratuitous bailee bears a duty**: 
➡ (query entails a gratuitous bailee bearing a duty) - The query specifies that a gratuitous depositary shall assume a duty, which directly aligns with this factor.

2. **To keep the bailed thing**:
➡ (query entails keeping the bailed thing) - The query mentions retaining the Thing deposited, which is synonymous with keeping the bailed thing.

3. **While exercising the same level of care**:
➡ (query entails exercising a level of care) - The query specifies "with the care of a good manager," implying a standard of care, though it doesn't explicitly state it's the same level as one would for their own property.

4. **That the bailee would exercise for their own property**:
➡ (query does not directly entail this factor) - The query refers to "the care of a good manager" rather than comparing it directly to the care one would give their own property.

Justification: The query aligns closely with the principles outlined in the factors, except for the specific comparison to the care one would exercise for their own property. However, the essence of responsible caretaking is preserved through the reference to a "good manager's" care.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant.

- The article discusses a "gratuitous bailee," while the query refers to a "gratuitous depositary." Both terms essentially describe an individual who receives goods or property from another without payment, with the understanding that they will be returned or cared for.
- Despite the slight difference in terminology (bailee vs. depositary), both roles imply a similar relationship and set of responsibilities towards the bailed or deposited item.

Given this analysis, it's reasonable to conclude that:
• **(verdict Yes)** - The query’s verdict and the article’s verdict apply to the same defendant, as both are concerned with the duties of an individual receiving goods without payment, regardless of whether they're termed a bailee or depositary.

(ii) if the seller unequivocally manifests the intention to refuse to cure the non-conformity of performance;
(iii) if, due to the nature of the contract or a manifestation of intention by the parties, the purpose of the contract is unable to be achieved unless the performance is carried out at a specific time on a specific date or within a certain period of time, and the seller fails to cure the non-conformity of the performance at the time or before the period expires; or
(iv) beyond the cases set forth in the preceding items, it is obvious that the seller is unlikely to cure the non-conformity of the performance even if the buyer makes the demand referred to in the preceding paragraph.
(3) If the non-conformity referred to in paragraph (1) is due to grounds attributable to the buyer, the buyer may not request a reduction of the price under the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs.
