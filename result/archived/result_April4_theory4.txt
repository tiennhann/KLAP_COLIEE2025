article: (Assignability of Claims)
Article 466 (2) Even if a party to a claim manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim (hereinafter referred to as the "manifestation of intention to restrict assignment"), the validity of the assignment of the claim is not impaired.
(3) In the case prescribed in the preceding paragraph, the obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party such as the assignee that knew or did not know due to gross negligence that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment was made, and may duly assert against such third party any event that results in extinguishment of the obligation such as payment to the assignor.
(4) The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the obligor does not perform the obligation, and the third party prescribed in that paragraph makes a demand to the obligor for the performance to the assignor by specifying a reasonable period of time, but the obligor does not perform the obligation within that period.
query: Claim X, the claim of the payment of the sales price of A against B, has a special agreement prohibiting the assignment, but C acquired Claim X while knowing the existence of the special agreement prohibiting the assignment. C made a demand to B for the performance to C by specifying a reasonable period of time, but B did not perform the obligation within that period. In this case, B may not refuse to perform the obligation to C based on the special agreement prohibiting the assignment.

(i) receiving or using any property producing civil fruit;
(ii) borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation;
(iii) performing an act with the purpose of acquiring or losing any right regarding immovables or other significant property;
(iv) suing any procedural act;
(v) giving a gift, reaching a settlement, or entering into an arbitration agreement (meaning an arbitration agreement as provided in Article 2, paragraph (1) of the Arbitration Act (Act No. 138 of 2003));
(vi) accepting or renouncing a succession or dividing an estate;
(vii) refusing an offer of a gift, renouncing a legacy, accepting an offer of gift with burden, or accepting a legacy with burden;
(viii) constructing a new building, renovating, expanding, or undertaking major repairs;
(ix) granting a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602; or
(x) performing any of the acts set forth in the preceding items as a legal representative of a person with qualified legal capacity (meaning a minor, adult ward, or person under curatorship or a person under assistance who is subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1); the same applies hereinafter).
(2) At the request of a person as referred to in the main clause of Article 11
or the curator or curator's supervisor, the family court may decide that the person under curatorship must also obtain the consent of the curator before performing an act other than those set forth in each of the items of the preceding paragraph;provided, however, that this does not apply to an act provided for in the proviso to Article 9.
(3) If the curator does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent at the request of the person under curatorship.
(4) An act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.
query: With respect to any act which requires the consent of the curator, if the curator does not give consent in cases where the interest of the person under curatorship is unlikely to be prejudiced, the family court may, at the request of the person under curatorship, give permission in lieu of the consent of the curator.

article: Article 13
(1) A person under curatorship must obtain the consent of the curator in order to perform any of the following acts;provided, however, that this does not apply to an act provided for in the proviso of Article 9:
(i) receiving or using any property producing civil fruit;
(ii) borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation;
(iii) performing an act with the purpose of acquiring or losing any right regarding immovables or other significant property;
(iv) suing any procedural act;
(v) giving a gift, reaching a settlement, or entering into an arbitration agreement (meaning an arbitration agreement as provided in Article 2, paragraph (1) of the Arbitration Act (Act No. 138 of 2003));
(vi) accepting or renouncing a succession or dividing an estate;
(vii) refusing an offer of a gift, renouncing a legacy, accepting an offer of gift with burden, or accepting a legacy with burden;
(viii) constructing a new building, renovating, expanding, or undertaking major repairs;
(ix) granting a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602; or
(x) performing any of the acts set forth in the preceding items as a legal representative of a person with qualified legal capacity (meaning a minor, adult ward, or person under curatorship or a person under assistance who is subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1); the same applies hereinafter).
(2) At the request of a person as referred to in the main clause of Article 11
or the curator or curator's supervisor, the family court may decide that the person under curatorship must also obtain the consent of the curator before performing an act other than those set forth in each of the items of the preceding paragraph;provided, however, that this does not apply to an act provided for in the proviso to Article 9.
(3) If the curator does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent at the request of the person under curatorship.
(4) An act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.
query: With respect to any act which requires the consent of the curator, if the curator does not give consent in cases where the interest of the person under curatorship is unlikely to be prejudiced, the person under curatorship may make a claim to the family court for a permission in lieu of the consent of the curator.
