2. The employee inflicts damage on a third party with respect to the execution of that business.
3. The employer exercised reasonable care in appointing the employee.
4. The employer exercised reasonable care in supervising the business.
5. The damage could not have been avoided even if the employer had exercised reasonable care.
6. A person supervises a business on behalf of the employer.
7. The employer or supervisor has the right to reimbursement against the employee.

Verdict: A person that employs another person for a business undertaking is liable to compensate for damage inflicted on a third party by that person's employees, unless the exceptions apply.
Verdict: A person that supervises a business on behalf of the employer also has the liability referred to in the preceding paragraph. 
Verdict: The provisions of the preceding two paragraphs do not preclude the employer or supervisor from exercising their right to reimbursement against the employee.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze the given civil legal article context, let's break down the text into key factors and verdicts based on the instructions:

1. **The subject matter of the claim is to be determined by a choice being made from among more than one performance** - This condition sets the scenario in which the right to choose becomes relevant.
2. **The right to choose belongs to the obligor** - Identifies who has the authority to make the choice when there are multiple performances possible.
3. **The right to choose is exercised by manifesting the intention to the counterparty** - Specifies how the choice must be communicated or made known.
4. **The manifestation of intention may not be withdrawn without the consent of the counterparty** - Outlines a condition under which a change in the initial choice can be made.

Verdict: The obligor has the right to choose among more than one performance, and this choice is finalized upon manifestation of intention to the counterparty unless the counterparty consents to a withdrawal of that intention.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 406 and 407, I will generate four legal case scenarios corresponding to each factor. Here they are:

(1 | N)
Justification: If only the first factor occurs ("The subject matter of the claim is to be determined by a choice being made from among more than one performance"), without any further action or specification on who has the right to choose or how this choice is exercised, it does not inherently obligate the defendant. The mere existence of multiple performances does not establish an obligation without further context.

(2 | Y)
Justification: If only the second factor occurs ("The right to choose belongs to the obligor"), this implies that there's an established relationship where one party (the obligor) has a defined role with respect to making choices. This scenario suggests that the obligor is indeed in a position of responsibility and thus can be considered obligated, as they have the authority to make decisions regarding performances.

(3 | N)
Justification: If only the third factor occurs ("The right to choose is exercised by manifesting the intention to the counterparty"), without specifying who has this right or the context of multiple performances, it doesn't necessarily establish an obligation. The act of manifestation could be a necessary step but isn't sufficient on its own to determine obligation without knowing who is making the choice and why.

(4 | Y)
Justification: If only the fourth factor occurs ("The manifestation of intention may not be withdrawn without the consent of the counterparty"), this implies that there has been a prior commitment or decision made (manifestation of intention) which now binds the parties in some way. The fact that withdrawal requires consent indicates an established obligation, as it suggests that one party's actions have consequences for the other, thereby creating a form of legal bond.

And to fulfill the requirement of using combinations of factors without repeating any combination:

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: When both the subject matter is to be determined by choice among multiple performances and the right to choose belongs to the obligor, this clearly outlines a scenario where the defendant (as the obligor) has both the responsibility and the authority to make a decision. Thus, they are obligated to exercise this choice.

(1, 3 | N)
Justification: Even if there's a subject matter to be determined by choice among multiple performances and the right to choose is exercised by manifesting intention, without specifying who has this right, it does not directly imply an obligation on the defendant. The method of exercising the choice (manifestation) doesn't itself establish the defendant's role or responsibility.

(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: If there are multiple performances from which to choose and the manifestation of intention may not be withdrawn without consent, this suggests that once a choice is made and communicated (and thus becomes binding due to the requirement for consent to withdraw), the defendant is indeed obligated. The combination of factors implies a commitment has been entered into.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: When the right to choose belongs to the obligor and this right is exercised by manifesting intention to the counterparty, it clearly establishes that the obligor (defendant) has both the authority and the method to fulfill their obligation. Thus, they are obligated to make a choice.

(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: If the right to choose belongs to the obligor and the manifestation of intention may not be withdrawn without consent, this implies that the defendant's choices are binding under certain conditions (requirement for consent to withdraw). This scenario suggests an obligation because the defendant's decisions have legal consequences.

(3, 4 | N)
Justification: Even with the method of exercising choice (manifestation of intention) and the condition that such manifestation may not be withdrawn without consent, if it's unclear who has this right or in what context (multiple performances), it doesn't directly establish an obligation on the defendant. The focus here is more on the mechanics and implications of making a choice rather than establishing the defendant's role.

(1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: When all factors regarding the subject matter being determined by choice, the obligor having the right to choose, and this right being exercised through manifestation of intention are present, it establishes a clear scenario where the defendant (as the obligor) has both the authority, the responsibility, and the method to fulfill their obligation. Thus, they are obligated.

(1, 2, 4 | Y)
Justification: This combination includes multiple performances, the obligor's right to choose, and the binding nature of manifestations of intention (requiring consent for withdrawal). It clearly outlines a scenario where the defendant is not only responsible for making a choice but also bound by the implications of that choice, thereby establishing an obligation.

(1, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: Even without specifying who has the right to choose, when there are multiple performances, a method for exercising this choice (manifestation), and a condition that makes this manifestation binding (requirement for consent to withdraw), it suggests a structured decision-making process with legal implications. This structure implies an obligation on the part of the defendant to engage with this process.

(2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: When the right to choose belongs to the obligor, and this is exercised through manifestation of intention which cannot be withdrawn without consent, it establishes a clear obligation on the defendant. They have the authority, the method, and are bound by their decisions.

(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: With all factors present, including multiple performances, the obligor's right to choose, the method of manifestation for exercising this choice, and the binding nature of such manifestations, it leaves no doubt that the defendant is obligated. All aspects necessary to establish a legal obligation are covered in this scenario.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if the obligor of an alternative obligation manifests the intention to exercise the right to choose, the manifestation may not be withdrawn without the consent of the obligee even before the due date of the obligation. According to Article 407(2), "The manifestation of intention referred to in the preceding paragraph may not be withdrawn without the consent of the counterparty." This directly supports the query's statement, as it does not specify any conditions related to the timing (such as before or after the due date) under which the withdrawal can be made, only that consent from the counterparty is required. Therefore, logically, the query is True.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The subject matter of the claim is to be determined by a choice being made from among more than one performance**: The query implies this scenario by mentioning "an alternative obligation," which involves choosing among more than one performance.
   - (query entails 1)

2. **The right to choose belongs to the obligor**: The query mentions "the obligor... manifests the intention to exercise the right to choose," indicating that the obligor has this right.
   - (query entails 2)

3. **The right to choose is exercised by manifesting the intention to the counterparty**: The query states "the obligor... manifests the intention," which aligns with exercising the right to choose by manifestation.
   - (query entails 3)

4. **The manifestation of intention may not be withdrawn without the consent of the counterparty**: This is directly stated in the query, emphasizing that withdrawal requires consent.
   - (query entails 4)

These justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query accurately reflects the conditions and processes outlined in the articles.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query discusses the obligor's right to choose and the conditions under which this choice can be withdrawn. It does not directly state that the defendant is obligated but rather outlines a scenario within an obligation context. However, since it talks about the obligations and rights within an alternative obligation without specifying a defendant or implying a legal case against someone, we must consider if it implies an obligation in a broader sense.

Given the context provided, the query seems to explain a principle of obligation rather than determining a specific defendant's obligations in a legal dispute. Therefore, based on the information given and the nature of the task:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 619, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

* The lessee continues to make use or take the profits of the thing after the expiration of the term of the lease.
* The lessor knows about the lessee's continued use or profit-taking and raises no objection.
* A further lease is entered into under conditions identical to those of the previous lease, as presumed by the circumstances.
* Each party has the right to give a notice of termination pursuant to the provisions of Article 617 in cases where a further lease is presumed.
* One of the parties provided security for the previous lease.
* The term of the lease has expired, leading to the extinguishment of the security provided, except in certain cases.
* A security deposit prescribed in Article 622-2, paragraph (1) is exempt from extinguishment upon expiration of the term.

Verdict: If a lessee continues to make use or take the profits of the thing after the expiration of the term of the lease and a lessor that knows of the same raises no objection, it is presumed that a further lease is entered into under conditions identical to those of the previous lease.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 619, I will generate 7 unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of the factors has occurred and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, the lessee continues to make use or take the profits of the thing after the expiration of the term of the lease (factor 1), and the lessor knows about this continued use or profit-taking and raises no objection (factor 2). Given these factors, it is presumed that a further lease is entered into under conditions identical to those of the previous lease. Therefore, the defendant (lessee) is legally obligated to adhere to the terms of the presumed new lease.

2. (3, 5 | N)
Here, a further lease is entered into under conditions identical to those of the previous lease, as presumed by the circumstances (factor 3), and one of the parties provided security for the previous lease (factor 5). Although there's a presumed new lease, the provision of security for the previous lease does not automatically obligate the defendant in the context of the new lease without considering the terms of the security. Since the scenario doesn't specify that the security is still applicable or that its conditions are breached, we cannot conclude the defendant is obligated based solely on these factors.

3. (4, 6 | Y)
In this scenario, each party has the right to give a notice of termination pursuant to the provisions of Article 617 in cases where a further lease is presumed (factor 4), and the term of the lease has expired, leading to the extinguishment of the security provided, except in certain cases (factor 6). The expiration of the lease term and the potential for giving notice of termination imply that the parties are still bound by contractual obligations, at least until a notice is given. Thus, the defendant is legally obligated to consider these terms and potentially take action regarding the lease's status.

4. (1, 5 | N)
This case involves the lessee continuing to make use or take the profits of the thing after the expiration of the term of the lease (factor 1), and one of the parties provided security for the previous lease (factor 5). While the continued use suggests an ongoing interest in the property, the provision of security alone does not obligate the defendant without evidence that the terms of the security are being violated or that a new lease has been implicitly agreed upon. Therefore, based on these factors alone, we cannot determine a legal obligation.

5. (2, 7 | Y)
Here, the lessor knows about the lessee's continued use or profit-taking and raises no objection (factor 2), and a security deposit prescribed in Article 622-2, paragraph (1) is exempt from extinguishment upon expiration of the term (factor 7). The lessor's lack of objection implies tacit agreement to the continued use, potentially suggesting an ongoing lease arrangement. Moreover, the exemption of the security deposit from extinguishment indicates that some form of financial obligation or guarantee continues, thereby obligating the defendant.

6. (3, 4 | Y)
In this case, a further lease is entered into under conditions identical to those of the previous lease, as presumed by the circumstances (factor 3), and each party has the right to give a notice of termination pursuant to the provisions of Article 617 in cases where a further lease is presumed (factor 4). The presumption of a new lease with identical conditions, coupled with the ability to terminate, places the defendant under legal obligations as defined by the original lease agreement and the relevant article.

7. (6, 7 | N)
This scenario involves the term of the lease having expired, leading to the extinguishment of the security provided, except in certain cases (factor 6), and a security deposit prescribed in Article 622-2, paragraph (1) is exempt from extinguishment upon expiration of the term (factor 7). While the security deposit remains in effect, the expiration of the lease and the general extinguishment of security suggest that most obligations related to the original lease's security provisions are ended. Without evidence of a new agreement or violation of terms related to the security deposit, we cannot conclude the defendant is obligated based solely on these factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the articles. Here is the list of factors:

* Two or more movable properties with different owners can no longer be separated without damage due to accession.
* The movable properties are united by accession.
* It is not possible to separate the movables without damage.
* Excessive expense is required to separate the movables.
* The distinction of principal and accessory cannot be made between the movables united by accession.
* The price current at the time of the accession is used to determine proportion of co-ownership.

Verdict: If two or more movable properties with different owners can no longer be separated without damage due to accession, the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property. 
Verdict: If the distinction of principal and accessory cannot be made between the movables united by accession, the owner of each movable property co-owns the composite thing in proportion to the respective price current at the time of the accession.
Verdict: The same applies if excessive expense is required to separate the movables, implying that the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate six legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, two or more movable properties with different owners can no longer be separated without damage due to accession. According to Article 243, if this condition is met, the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
In this scenario, the movable properties are united by accession, and it is not possible to separate the movables without damage. Since the properties cannot be separated without damage, Article 243 applies, stating that the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property. Hence, the defendant is legally obligated.

3. (4 | Y)
Here, excessive expense is required to separate the movables. As stated in Article 243, "The same applies if excessive expense is required to separate the movables," implying that the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property. Thus, the defendant is legally obligated.

4. (5 | N)
In this case, the distinction of principal and accessory cannot be made between the movables united by accession. According to Article 244, if this condition is met, the owner of each movable property co-owns the composite thing in proportion to the respective price current at the time of the accession. Since there is no clear principal owner, the defendant's obligation is not determinate, and therefore, they are not legally obligated.

5. (1, 4 | Y)
In this scenario, two or more movable properties with different owners can no longer be separated without damage due to accession, and excessive expense is required to separate the movables. Both conditions support the application of Article 243, which states that the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property. Consequently, the defendant is legally obligated.

6. (2, 5, 6 | Y)
In this case, the movable properties are united by accession, the distinction of principal and accessory cannot be made between the movables united by accession, and the price current at the time of the accession is used to determine proportion of co-ownership. Article 244 applies, stating that the owner of each movable property co-owns the composite thing in proportion to the respective price current at the time of the accession. Since the defendant's share can be determined based on the price current at the time of accession, they are legally obligated to respect the co-ownership arrangement.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if two or more movables with different owners are so joined to each other that they can no longer be separated without damaging the same, the owner of secondary movable shall co-own the composite thing in proportion to the respective price current at the time of the accession. According to Article 243 and Article 244, when movables cannot be separated without damage or excessive expense is required for separation, the ownership belongs to the principal movable's owner unless the distinction between principal and accessory cannot be made, leading to co-ownership based on proportionate value.

However, the query suggests that in a scenario where separation would cause damage (implying either it's not possible to separate without damage or excessive expense is required), the secondary movable's owner co-owns the composite thing. This interpretation seems to align partially with Article 244 when it talks about co-ownership in proportion to price, but it doesn't correctly capture the nuance that such a situation (where distinction between principal and accessory cannot be made) leads to co-ownership.

Given this analysis, the query seems to misinterpret or oversimplify the conditions under which co-ownership is determined based on the price current at the time of accession. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query appears to be False because it does not accurately reflect the conditions outlined in Articles 243 and 244 for determining ownership or co-ownership.

## Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **Two or more movable properties with different owners can no longer be separated without damage due to accession**: The query mentions movables joined so they cannot be separated without damaging, which aligns with this scenario.
   - (query entails 1)

2. **The movable properties are united by accession**: This is implied in the query as it discusses movables "so joined to each other."
   - (query entails 2)

3. **It is not possible to separate the movables without damage**: The query directly mentions this condition.
   - (query entails 3)

4. **Excessive expense is required to separate the movables**: While implied in the broader context of accession, the query does not explicitly mention excessive expense as a factor for determining co-ownership.
   - (query does not entail 4)

5. **The distinction of principal and accessory cannot be made between the movables united by accession**: The query implies this scenario because it talks about co-ownership without specifying how to determine principal vs. accessory.
   - (query entails 5)

6. **The price current at the time of the accession is used to determine proportion of co-ownership**: The query mentions that co-ownership is in proportion to the respective price current at the time of accession, aligning with this factor.
   - (query entails 6)

These assessments show that while the query touches on several key factors, its implications and the specific scenario it describes do not perfectly align with the articles' stipulations for determining ownership or co-ownership. This misalignment supports the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False.

## Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query discusses a hypothetical scenario of movables joined by accession and suggests an outcome regarding co-ownership but does not directly imply any obligation on a defendant's part to take or refrain from taking a specific action. It seems more focused on describing a property law principle rather than imposing obligations.
- pledged(0)

The final answer is: $\boxed{False}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 I have carefully read Article 189. Here's the breakdown of the text into sentences or phrases, each representing a factor used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

1. A possessor in good faith acquires fruits derived from the thing under possession, which means that **a possessor in good faith** has certain rights to **fruits derived from the thing under possession**.
2. The concept of **good faith** is crucial in determining the possessor's rights and obligations.
3. A **possessor in good faith** is initially assumed to have legitimate possession of the thing, which affects their entitlement to **fruits derived from the thing**.
4. An **action on the title** that legally supports the possession can be filed against a possessor in good faith, which may impact their status as a possessor.
5. The timing of when the **action is filed** is significant in determining the possessor's status and potential liability.

Verdict: If a possessor in good faith is defeated in an action on the title that legally supports the possession, that possessor is deemed to be a possessor in bad faith as from the time when the action is filed.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 189, I will generate five unique legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 is present, which states that a possessor in good faith acquires fruits derived from the thing under possession. However, there is no indication of an action being filed or the possessor being defeated, so the defendant's status as a possessor in good faith remains unchanged, and they are not obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2 (concept of good faith) and 3 (possessor in good faith is initially assumed to have legitimate possession) are present. Although these factors highlight the importance of good faith, there is no mention of an action being filed or the possessor's status being challenged. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 4 (an action on the title that legally supports the possession can be filed) is present. The fact that an action has been filed implies that the defendant's possession is being challenged, and they may be deemed a possessor in bad faith if defeated. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 (possessor in good faith acquires fruits derived from the thing under possession) and 5 (the timing of when the action is filed is significant) are present. If an action is filed, challenging the possessor's title, and the defendant is deemed to have acquired fruits in bad faith from the time the action was filed, they may be obligated to return those fruits or face other consequences.

(2, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2 (concept of good faith), 4 (an action on the title that legally supports the possession can be filed), and 5 (the timing of when the action is filed is significant) are present. Given that an action has been filed, challenging the defendant's possession, and the concept of good faith is crucial in determining their rights and obligations, the defendant's status as a possessor in good faith may be revoked from the time the action was filed. Therefore, they are obligated to face the consequences of being deemed a possessor in bad faith.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that if a possessor in good faith is defeated in an action on the title, they shall be deemed to be a possessor in bad faith as from the time when such action was brought. According to Article 189(2), "If a possessor in good faith is defeated in an action on the title that legally supports the possession, that possessor is deemed to be a possessor in bad faith as from the time when the action is filed." This directly aligns with the query's statement. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided by Article 189, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **A possessor in good faith has certain rights to fruits derived from the thing under possession**: The query does not directly mention the rights to fruits but focuses on the change of status due to an action being filed. Thus, (query entails 1) is False.

2. **The concept of good faith is crucial in determining the possessor's rights and obligations**: The query implies a change from good faith to bad faith upon being defeated in an action, which means it considers the concept of good faith. Therefore, (query entails 2).

3. **A possessor in good faith is initially assumed to have legitimate possession of the thing, which affects their entitlement to fruits derived from the thing**: Similar to factor 1, this aspect about initial assumption and entitlement to fruits is not directly mentioned in the query. Hence, (query entails 3) is False.

4. **An action on the title that legally supports the possession can be filed against a possessor in good faith, which may impact their status as a possessor**: The query explicitly mentions being defeated in an action on the title, indicating it considers this factor. Therefore, (query entails 4).

5. **The timing of when the action is filed is significant in determining the possessor's status and potential liability**: The query states "as from the time when such action was brought," highlighting the importance of the timing of the action being filed. Thus, (query entails 5).

Justifications for factors 2, 4, and 5 align with the result from Task 1 that the query is True.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query suggests a change in status from good faith to bad faith upon being defeated in an action. This change can imply obligations or liabilities for the defendant that were not present before, especially concerning the fruits derived from the thing under possession and potential compensation for any damages caused during their period of possession. Therefore, the query does determine the defendant obligated to some extent based on the change in status and its implications. Hence, **pledged(1)**.

In summary:
- The query is True.
- (query entails 2), (query entails 4), (query entails 5)
- pledged(1)

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

* Two persons bear an obligation to each other that has the same kind of purpose
* Both obligations are due
* The nature of the obligation does not permit such a set-off
* A party manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off
* The manifestation of the intention may be duly asserted against a third party
* The third party knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the manifestation of the intention

Verdict: Each obligor may be relieved from the obligation by setting off the value of that obligation against the corresponding amount of the obligation of the other obligor.
======== Generate Examples:
 I'll generate six legal case scenarios based on the given factors. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only the factor "Two persons bear an obligation to each other that has the same kind of purpose" is present. Although this is a necessary condition for set-off, it is not sufficient on its own to determine the defendant's obligation. However, since the article implies that set-off is allowed when obligations have the same kind of purpose, and no other factors are present to restrict or prohibit set-off, we can infer that the defendant is obligated.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the factor "Both obligations are due" is present. This factor alone does not provide sufficient information to determine the defendant's obligation, as it only addresses the timing of the obligations. Without knowing more about the nature or purpose of the obligations, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(3 | N)
Justification: Here, only the factor "The nature of the obligation does not permit such a set-off" is present. This factor explicitly states that set-off is not allowed, which means the defendant is not obligated to relieve the other party's obligation through set-off.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, both factors "Two persons bear an obligation to each other that has the same kind of purpose" and "Both obligations are due" are present. Since both necessary conditions for set-off are met (same purpose and due obligations), we can conclude that the defendant is obligated to allow set-off.

(4 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the factor "A party manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off" is present. This factor indicates that one party has expressed a desire to limit or prevent set-off. Although this manifestation may not be enforceable against third parties without their knowledge or gross negligence, it still suggests that the defendant is not obligated to allow set-off.

(4, 5, 6 | N)
Justification: Here, all factors related to prohibiting or restricting set-off are present: "A party manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off", "The manifestation of the intention may be duly asserted against a third party", and "The third party knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the manifestation of the intention". Given that the manifestation is enforceable against the third party, we can conclude that the defendant is not obligated to allow set-off.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 **Task 1:**
Based on logical reasoning, the query is **True**. The article states that a manifestation of intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off may be duly asserted against a third party if the third party knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the manifestation. This aligns with the query's statement that a special agreement to prohibit a set-off can be asserted against an assignee who knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the existence of such an agreement.

**Task 2:**
Assessing whether the query expresses each factor:

1. **Two persons bear an obligation to each other that has the same kind of purpose**: The query does not directly mention this condition, but it implies a scenario where there's an obligation (a claim) involved. However, it doesn't explicitly state that both parties have obligations of the same kind of purpose. Thus, it does not clearly express this factor.
   - (query entails 1) is False.

2. **Both obligations are due**: The query does not mention anything about the obligations being due. Therefore, it does not express this factor.
   - (query entails 2) is False.

3. **The nature of the obligation does not permit such a set-off**: This factor is not mentioned in the query, which focuses on agreements to prohibit set-offs rather than the inherent nature of the obligations themselves.
   - (query entails 3) is False.

4. **A party manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off**: The query directly mentions "a special agreement to prohibit a set-off," which can be seen as a manifestation of such an intention.
   - (query entails 4) is True.

5. **The manifestation of the intention may be duly asserted against a third party**: The query states that this agreement "may be duly asserted against the assignee," aligning with this factor.
   - (query entails 5) is True.

6. **The third party knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the manifestation of the intention**: The query specifies that the assignee must have known or not known due to gross negligence about the special agreement, directly expressing this factor.
   - (query entails 6) is True.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query's truthfulness is supported by its alignment with specific factors mentioned in the article.

**Task 3:**
The query does not determine whether the defendant is obligated. It discusses conditions under which a special agreement regarding set-offs can be asserted against an assignee but does not conclude on the obligation status of any party.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 702, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

* A manager has incurred beneficial expenses for a principal.
* The manager may claim reimbursement of those costs from the principal.
* A manager has incurred beneficial obligations on behalf of the principal.
* The provisions of Article 650, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis to beneficial obligations incurred by a manager.
* A manager has engaged in benevolent intervention in another's business against the will of the principal.
* The provisions of the preceding two paragraphs apply mutatis mutandis to benevolent intervention, solely to the extent currently enriched.

Verdict: If a manager has incurred beneficial expenses or obligations for a principal, the manager may claim reimbursement of those costs from the principal, and if the manager has engaged in benevolent intervention against the will of the principal, the provisions apply mutatis mutandis to the extent currently enriched.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 702, I will generate six legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1 | Y)
Justification: The manager has incurred beneficial expenses for the principal, which directly triggers the right to claim reimbursement according to Article 702(1). Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

2. (2 | Y)
Justification: Although factor 2 stands alone, it implies that a condition for reimbursement exists, suggesting an obligation if the context of incurring beneficial expenses is considered implicitly. Thus, based on the structure of the article, the defendant would be obligated to reimburse, given the manager's right to claim reimbursement is acknowledged.

3. (3 | Y)
Justification: This factor indicates that the manager has incurred beneficial obligations on behalf of the principal. Article 702(2) applies mutatis mutandis, implying a legal basis for the manager to seek compensation or resolution regarding these obligations, hence indicating an obligation.

4. (4 | Y)
Justification: The application of Article 650, paragraph (2), mutatis mutandis to beneficial obligations implies there's a recognized legal framework for handling such situations, suggesting that the defendant would have obligations under this scenario, especially considering the manager's actions on behalf of the principal.

5. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: Combining factors of incurring beneficial expenses and obligations for the principal strengthens the case for the defendant being obligated. Both scenarios individually support reimbursement or compensation; together, they solidify the legal basis for such claims.

6. (5, 6 | N)
Justification: Although the manager engaged in benevolent intervention against the will of the principal, and the provisions apply mutatis mutandis to the extent currently enriched, this scenario does not directly imply a straightforward obligation for reimbursement or compensation without considering the specific extent of enrichment. Given the conditional nature ("solely to the extent currently enriched") and the absence of explicit beneficial expenses or obligations incurred with the principal's consent, it suggests a more nuanced situation where the defendant might not be obligated in the same manner as other scenarios.

Note: The interpretation aims to apply the factors within the context provided by Article 702, considering both the literal meaning of the text and the logical implications for legal obligations.

 Based on Article 356, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences to determine the relevant factors:

1. The pledgee of immovables has certain rights regarding the subject matter of a pledge.
2. The pledgee may use the immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge.
3. The pledgee may profit from the immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge.
4. The use and profit from the immovables must be in line with the way the relevant immovables are used.

Verdict: The pledgee of immovables may use and profit from the immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge in line with the way the relevant immovables are used.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 356, I will generate four legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of these factors.

1. (1 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 1 is present: The pledgee of immovables has certain rights regarding the subject matter of a pledge. However, without any specific actions like use or profit, or consideration of how the immovables are used, it's not enough to determine an obligation solely based on having rights.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
Here, factors 2 and 3 are present: The pledgee may use the immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge, and the pledgee may profit from the immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge. Given these actions (use and profit), it indicates an active engagement with the pledged property, suggesting an obligation.

3. (4 | N)
In this case, only factor 4 is considered: The use and profit from the immovables must be in line with the way the relevant immovables are used. Without any actual use or profit occurring (factors 2 and 3), or recognition of rights (factor 1), it's insufficient to establish an obligation based solely on a requirement for how use should occur.

4. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
In this comprehensive scenario, all factors are present: The pledgee has certain rights, may use and profit from the immovables, and does so in line with their typical use. This combination clearly outlines a situation where the pledgee is actively engaged with the property in a manner consistent with its intended or normal use, thereby indicating an obligation.

These scenarios cover different combinations of factors without repetition, providing a clear verdict for each based on the occurrence of specific conditions outlined in Article 356.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that a pledgee of immovable property may use and receive profits from the immovable property that is the subject matter of a pledge, in accordance with the method of its use, but may not collect fruits derived by the real property. 

Article 356 indicates that the pledgee of immovables may use and profit from the immovables in line with their usual use. This implies that as long as the use and profiting are consistent with how the immovable is typically used, the pledgee has certain rights.

However, the query introduces a distinction by stating that the pledgee "may not collect fruits derived by the real property," which could be interpreted as limiting the types of profits that can be received. The original article does not explicitly address what happens to fruits or natural increases from the immovable property, suggesting an ambiguity or potential restriction not directly covered by Article 356.

Given this analysis, without explicit information on how "fruits derived by the real property" are treated under Article 356, we might consider the query as introducing a specific condition (regarding fruits) not explicitly mentioned in the article. Thus, based solely on the information provided and focusing strictly on the use and profit as per typical usage, the core of the query aligns with the article's general principle but introduces an unaddressed aspect regarding "fruits."

Therefore, considering only the information given and without additional context about how Article 356 treats fruits or natural increases from immovables, we might lean towards a cautious interpretation that does not directly contradict the article but also recognizes an unresolved aspect.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The pledgee of immovables has certain rights regarding the subject matter of a pledge.**
   - (query entails 1) The query indeed suggests the pledgee has rights, specifically to use and receive profits from the immovable property.

2. **The pledgee may use the immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge.**
   - (query entails 2) The query explicitly states this right, in accordance with the method of its use.

3. **The pledgee may profit from the immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge.**
   - (query entails 3) However, it introduces a limitation regarding "fruits derived by the real property," which suggests a nuanced view on what profiting means in this context.

4. **The use and profit from the immovables must be in line with the way the relevant immovables are used.**
   - (query entails 4) The query aligns with this, stating that use and profit should be "in accordance with the method of its use."

Justifications align with the initial analysis, indicating the query generally supports the principles outlined but introduces a distinction not explicitly covered by Article 356.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query outlines specific rights and limitations for the pledgee regarding immovable property. It suggests that while there are rights to use and profit from the property in its typical manner, there might be restrictions on collecting certain types of profits (like fruits derived by the real property). This implies a level of obligation or responsibility for the pledgee to act within these bounds.

Given this interpretation, we could represent the situation as **pledged(1)** because the query does imply obligations or responsibilities for how the pledgee interacts with the immovable property, even if it introduces nuances not directly addressed by Article 356.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 400, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

* The subject matter of a claim is the delivery of a specific thing
* The obligor must retain the thing 
* The retention of the thing must be with the due care of a prudent manager
* The due care of a prudent manager is determined in light of the contract 
* The due care of a prudent manager is determined in light of other sources of claims 
* The due care of a prudent manager is determined in light of the common sense in the transaction
* The retention of the thing must be until the delivery

Verdict: If the subject matter of a claim is the delivery of a specific thing, the obligor must retain the thing with the due care of a prudent manager, which is determined in light of the contract or other sources of claims and the common sense in the transaction, until the delivery.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 400, I have generated 7 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: The subject matter of a claim being the delivery of a specific thing is only one factor, and by itself, it does not create an obligation for the defendant to retain the thing.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Although the obligor must retain the thing (factor 2) and with due care of a prudent manager (factor 3), without considering the contract or other sources of claims, the common sense in the transaction, or the requirement to retain until delivery, the defendant's obligation is not clearly established.

(4 | N)
Justification: The due care of a prudent manager being determined in light of the contract (factor 4) is only one aspect of determining the obligor's duty. Without considering other factors, such as the subject matter of the claim or the retention of the thing, the defendant's obligation remains uncertain.

(5 | N)
Justification: Similarly, the due care of a prudent manager being determined in light of other sources of claims (factor 5) is insufficient on its own to establish the defendant's obligation, as it does not consider the contract, common sense, or retention requirements.

(6 | N)
Justification: The due care of a prudent manager being determined in light of the common sense in the transaction (factor 6) is also an isolated factor that does not provide enough context to determine the defendant's obligation.

(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 | Y)
Justification: When all factors are present, including the subject matter of the claim being the delivery of a specific thing (factor 1), the obligor retaining the thing (factor 2), with due care of a prudent manager (factor 3), determined in light of the contract (factor 4), other sources of claims (factor 5), common sense in the transaction (factor 6), and retention until delivery (factor 7), the defendant is clearly obligated to retain the thing.

(1, 2, 7 | Y)
Justification: Even with a subset of factors, including the subject matter of the claim being the delivery of a specific thing (factor 1), the obligor retaining the thing (factor 2), and retention until delivery (factor 7), the defendant can still be considered obligated, as these factors collectively establish a clear duty to retain the thing.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "A donor shall assume a duty to retain the subject matter exercising care identical to that he/she exercises for his/her own property until the completion of such delivery." This statement aligns with the principle outlined in Article 400, which requires the obligor to retain a thing (in this case, the subject matter of a claim) with the due care of a prudent manager. The query essentially specifies that the level of care should be similar to what one would exercise for their own property, which can be considered a form of "due care" as it implies taking reasonable and prudent steps to protect the item.

Given this analysis, the query seems to reflect a principle similar to that in Article 400, suggesting that the statement could be considered True in the context provided.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

1. **The subject matter of a claim is the delivery of a specific thing**: The query mentions "the subject matter" without specifying it's about the delivery of a specific thing, but it implies a focus on retaining something until delivery, which aligns with this concept. (query entails 1)

2. **The obligor must retain the thing**: The query directly states that the donor shall assume a duty to retain the subject matter, which aligns with this requirement. (query entails 2)

3. **The retention of the thing must be with the due care of a prudent manager**: While not using the exact phrase "due care of a prudent manager," the query suggests exercising care identical to that for one's own property, which can be seen as equivalent or similar in intent. (query entails 3)

4. **The due care of a prudent manager is determined in light of the contract**: The query does not explicitly mention determining care based on the contract. It focuses more on the level of care rather than where that standard comes from. (query does not entail 4)

5. **The due care of a prudent manager is determined in light of other sources of claims**: Similar to factor 4, the query does not discuss other sources of claims as a basis for determining due care. (query does not entail 5)

6. **The due care of a prudent manager is determined in light of the common sense in the transaction**: The implication that one should exercise care similar to what they would for their own property could be seen as related to common sense, but it's not explicitly tied to the specific transaction's context. (query does not entail 6)

7. **The retention of the thing must be until the delivery**: The query states "until the completion of such delivery," which directly aligns with this requirement. (query entails 7)

Justifications provided support that the query generally aligns with the principles outlined in Article 400, particularly concerning the duty to retain and the standard of care, though it does not explicitly address all factors like contract or other sources.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query implies a duty on the part of the donor (who could be considered the defendant in a case where delivery is at issue) to retain the subject matter with a certain level of care until delivery. This suggests an obligation on the defendant's part, as they are expected to fulfill this duty.

Therefore, pledged(1). 

In summary:
- The query can be considered True based on logical reasoning.
- The query entails factors 1, 2, 3, and 7 but does not explicitly entail factors 4, 5, and 6.
- The defendant is determined to be obligated, as indicated by pledged(1).

9. The obligor must reimburse the obligee for benefits received from being released from an obligation if the obligor benefits from such release.

Verdict: 
The mandatary may claim remuneration under specific conditions, and the obligee's rights regarding counter-performance depend on the circumstances surrounding the impossibility of performance.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 9 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The provisions of Articles 646 through 648, Article 649, and Article 650, paragraphs (1) and (2) apply mutatis mutandis to bailments. This implies that the defendant, as a mandatary in a bailment, is subject to these provisions and may be obligated to perform certain duties.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator (factor 2). Additionally, the mandatary is to receive remuneration only after having performed the mandated business (factor 3). Since there are no special agreements and the defendant has not yet performed the mandated business, they cannot claim remuneration and are not obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: If the remuneration is specified with reference to period, the provisions of Article 624, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis. This implies that the defendant's remuneration is tied to a specific period, and they may be obligated to perform certain duties during that time.

(5 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandatary is no longer able to perform the mandated business due to grounds not attributable to the mandator. Since the defendant is in this situation, they are obligated to receive proportional remuneration.

(6 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandate is terminated during the course of performance. As the defendant's mandate has been terminated, they are obligated to receive proportional remuneration.

(7 | N)
Justification: If the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, the obligee has a specific right regarding counter-performance. However, this does not necessarily imply that the defendant is obligated, as the impossibility may be beyond their control.

(8 | Y)
Justification: If the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, the obligee may not refuse to complete counter-performance. As the defendant is the obligee in this scenario, they are obligated to complete counter-performance despite the impossibility.

(2, 5, 9 | Y)
Justification: In the absence of any special agreements (factor 2), the mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if they are no longer able to perform the mandated business due to grounds not attributable to the mandator (factor 5). Additionally, if the obligor benefits from being released from an obligation, they must reimburse the obligee for the benefit (factor 9). Given these circumstances, the defendant is obligated to receive proportional remuneration and potentially reimburse the obligee.

(1, 3, 7 | N)
Justification: The provisions of Articles 646 through 648, Article 649, and Article 650, paragraphs (1) and (2) apply mutatis mutandis to bailments (factor 1), but this does not directly imply an obligation. The mandatary is to receive remuneration only after having performed the mandated business (factor 3), which has not occurred yet. Furthermore, if the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, the obligee has a specific right regarding counter-performance (factor 7), but this does not create an obligation for the defendant in this scenario. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the process step by step.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that in a contract for deposit for value, if the performance of the obligation to return the deposited thing has become impossible due to reasons not attributable to the depositary, he/she may not claim remuneration from the depositor with respect to the period after the impossibility of performance of the agreed duration.

Given Article 536(1), which states that if the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, the obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance, and considering Article 648(3)(i), which allows a mandatary (in this context, similar to a depositary) to demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if they are no longer able to perform due to grounds not attributable to them, we can infer that the query seems to align with the principle of not claiming remuneration for periods after impossibility. However, it's crucial to note that the specific context (contract for deposit for value) and the mention of "after the impossibility of performance" introduce nuances.

Based on logical reasoning and considering the general principles outlined in the articles, the query seems to align with the idea that one should not benefit from a situation where they cannot fulfill their obligations due to no fault of the other party. However, the precise application can depend on specific contractual terms and the jurisdiction's interpretation of these principles.

**Logical Reasoning Outcome: True**

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The provisions of Articles 646 through 648, Article 649, and Article 650, paragraphs (1) and (2) apply mutatis mutandis to bailments.**
   - The query does not directly address this factor as it pertains to bailments specifically.

   (query entails 1): False

2. **In the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator.**
   - This is somewhat relevant but does not directly apply since the query discusses a situation with impossibility of performance.

   (query entails 2): Partially Relevant

3. **The mandatary is to receive remuneration only after having performed the mandated business.**
   - The query implies that remuneration might be affected by impossibility but doesn't directly state this principle.

   (query entails 3): False

4. **If the remuneration is specified with reference to period, the provisions of Article 624, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis.**
   - The query mentions a "period after the impossibility of performance" but does not reference Article 624.

   (query entails 4): False

5. **The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandatary is no longer able to perform the mandated business due to grounds not attributable to the mandator.**
   - This seems closely related, as the query implies a similar scenario where impossibility affects remuneration.

   (query entails 5): True

6. **The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandate is terminated during the course of performance.**
   - The query does not directly address termination but rather impossibility.

   (query entails 6): False

7. **If the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, the obligee has a specific right regarding counter-performance.**
   - This is relevant as the query discusses impossibility affecting obligations.

   (query entails 7): True

8. **If the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, the obligee may not refuse to complete counter-performance.**
   - The query does not address situations where the impossibility is due to the obligee's actions.

   (query entails 8): False

9. **The obligor must reimburse the obligee for benefits received from being released from an obligation if the obligor benefits from such release.**
   - This factor about reimbursement and benefit does not directly apply to the query's scenario.

   (query entails 9): False

**Alignment with Task 1 Result:** The justifications generally support the logical reasoning outcome that the query is true, especially considering factors 5 and 7, which deal with impossibility of performance and its effects on obligations and remuneration.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query outlines a scenario where the depositary may not claim remuneration under specific conditions (impossibility of returning the deposited thing not due to their fault), which implies an obligation on the part of the depositary regarding their claims for remuneration after such an event.

**Pledged Outcome:** pledged(1)

In summary, based on the tasks:
- The query is considered **True** based on logical reasoning.
- The assessment of factors shows alignment with certain principles outlined in the articles, especially regarding impossibility and its effects on obligations.
- The query implies that the defendant (or depositary) has an obligation regarding claiming remuneration under specific conditions, thus **pledged(1)**.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 424, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.
2. The act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.
3. The beneficiary of the act does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.
4. The subject matter of the act is a property right.
5. The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act prescribed in paragraph (1).
6. The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.

Verdict: The court may rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee, under certain conditions specified in the article. 

Note: I have excluded the verdict sentence from the list of factors and formatted it separately as instructed. The factors are listed in a single order, without separating them by paragraph or subsection.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 424, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a specific subset of factors and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, the obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee (factor 1), and the act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee (factor 2). Given these factors, the defendant is likely obligated because they knowingly committed an act that would harm the obligee. The court may rescind this act to protect the obligee's interests.

2. (3, 4 | N)
Here, the beneficiary of the act does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced (factor 3), and the subject matter of the act is a property right (factor 4). Although the subject matter involves property rights, which could potentially lead to a rescission demand under certain conditions, the lack of knowledge by the beneficiary about the prejudice to the obligee (as per factor 3) does not directly support the obligee's demand for rescission based on Article 424. Therefore, without additional factors indicating the obligor's intent or the enforceability of the claim, the defendant is not obligated.

3. (1, 5 | Y)
In this scenario, the obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee (factor 1), and the obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act prescribed in paragraph (1) (factor 5). The existence of a prior cause for the claim, combined with the obligor's knowledge of the prejudicial effect of their act, supports the obligee's demand for rescission. Thus, the defendant is obligated.

4. (2, 6 | Y)
This case involves the act being committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee (factor 2), and the obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution (factor 6). The combination of the obligor's intent to harm and the enforceability of the obligee's claim suggests that the defendant should be held accountable for their actions. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

5. (3, 5 | N)
Here, the beneficiary of the act does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced (factor 3), and the obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act prescribed in paragraph (1) (factor 5). While the claim has a prior cause, the lack of knowledge by the beneficiary about the potential prejudice does not establish a direct link to the defendant's obligation regarding the rescission of the act. Without evidence of the obligor's intent or the enforceability of the claim, the defendant is not obligated.

6. (4, 6 | Y)
In this final scenario, the subject matter of the act is a property right (factor 4), and the obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution (factor 6). The fact that the act involves property rights, which are directly addressed by Article 424, combined with the enforceability of the obligee's claim, provides a strong basis for the court to consider rescinding the act. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 424, leading to determinate verdicts regarding the defendant's legal obligations.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze Article 428, I will break it down into its constituent parts to identify key factors that influence the application of this provision.

1. The provisions of the following Subsection (Joint and Several Claims) apply mutatis mutandis: 
   - This indicates that rules from another subsection are being applied with necessary adjustments.
   - Key term: "mutatis mutandis," meaning with necessary changes.

2. Excluding the provisions of Articles 433 and 435:
   - Certain articles (433 and 435) within the Joint and Several Claims subsection do not apply in this context.
   - Key terms: "excluding," "Articles 433," and "435."

3. The subject matter of a claim is indivisible by nature:
   - The claim's subject must be something that cannot be divided naturally.
   - Key term: "indivisible by nature."

4. The claim is held by two or more obligees:
   - There are multiple parties (at least two) holding the claim.
   - Key terms: "two or more obligees," "held by."

Verdict: The provisions of the Joint and Several Claims subsection (excluding Articles 433 and 435) apply if a claim's subject is indivisible and held by multiple obligees.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the article, there are 4 factors. I will generate 4 legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors.

1. (1 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 1 is present: "The provisions of the following Subsection (Joint and Several Claims) apply mutatis mutandis." Since this factor alone does not provide sufficient conditions for the defendant to be obligated (as it lacks specifics about the claim's subject and the number of obligees), the verdict is No (N).

2. (2, 3 | N)
Here, factors 2 and 3 are present: "Excluding the provisions of Articles 433 and 435" and "The subject matter of a claim is indivisible by nature." Despite knowing the claim's subject is indivisible and certain articles are excluded, without the application of the Joint and Several Claims subsection or information about the number of obligees, the defendant cannot be determined to be obligated. Thus, the verdict is No (N).

3. (1, 4 | Y)
In this case, factors 1 and 4 are present: "The provisions of the following Subsection (Joint and Several Claims) apply mutatis mutandis" and "The claim is held by two or more obligees." Given that the rules for Joint and Several Claims apply with necessary adjustments and there are multiple obligees, this scenario suggests a situation where obligations could be shared among parties. Therefore, considering the applicability of joint and several claims principles, the defendant could be seen as obligated. The verdict is Yes (Y).

4. (2, 3, 4 | Y)
This scenario includes factors 2, 3, and 4: "Excluding the provisions of Articles 433 and 435," "The subject matter of a claim is indivisible by nature," and "The claim is held by two or more obligees." With the claim being indivisible, certain articles excluded from application, and multiple obligees holding the claim, it aligns closely with the conditions under which the provisions of the Joint and Several Claims subsection would apply mutatis mutandis. Given these specific conditions, the defendant can be considered legally obligated. The verdict is Yes (Y).

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False

The query states that a monetary claim may not be made indivisible due to the manifestation of intention of the parties involved. This statement can be analyzed in the context of Article 428, which discusses claims that are indivisible by nature and held by two or more obligees. The article does not explicitly mention how the intention of the parties affects the divisibility of a claim, especially concerning monetary claims.

However, logically, if a claim is inherently divisible (like a monetary claim), the parties' intention might not be enough to make it indivisible under all legal frameworks. This would depend on specific legal principles and the nature of the agreement or contract in question. Given this understanding, the query seems to align with common sense regarding divisible claims, suggesting that certain types of claims, like monetary ones, are inherently divisible regardless of the parties' intentions.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and without specific legal context indicating otherwise, the query could be considered **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The provisions of the following Subsection (Joint and Several Claims) apply mutatis mutandis:**  
   The query does not directly address the application of provisions from another subsection. Therefore, it does not express this factor directly.  
   (query entails 1) = False

2. **Excluding the provisions of Articles 433 and 435:**  
   The query does not mention excluding specific articles or provisions, so it does not express this factor.  
   (query entails 2) = False

3. **The subject matter of a claim is indivisible by nature:**  
   The query touches on the concept of claims being divisible or indivisible but specifically mentions that a monetary claim may not be made indivisible. This suggests an understanding that certain claims are inherently divisible, which indirectly relates to the concept of claims being indivisible by nature. However, it does so in a negative context (i.e., what cannot be made indivisible).  
   (query entails 3) = True, with the understanding that it discusses divisibility rather than indivisibility directly.

4. **The claim is held by two or more obligees:**  
   The query does not address the number of parties holding a claim. Therefore, it does not express this factor.  
   (query entails 4) = False

Justifications align with the initial assessment that the query's truth value hinges on the nature of claims and the implications of party intentions on claim divisibility.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Implies the Defendant is Obligated

The query discusses the characteristics of a monetary claim in relation to its divisibility, not directly implying any obligations of a defendant. It focuses on the inherent properties of certain types of claims rather than the obligations or responsibilities of parties involved in a legal dispute.

Therefore, the query does not imply that the defendant is obligated:

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 519, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences to determine the factors used in cases applying this article:

1. An obligee manifests the intention to release an obligor: This phrase indicates that the obligee must clearly show their intent to release the obligor from the obligation.
2. The manifestation is directed to the obligor: The phrase "to that obligor" suggests that the intention to release must be communicated directly to the obligor.
3. The obligee has an obligation: The existence of an obligation is implied, and the obligee's claim is based on this obligation.
4. The obligor is released from the obligation: This phrase indicates that the obligor is no longer bound by the obligation.

Verdict: If the above factors are met, the obligee's claim is extinguished.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the factors of Article 519, we will consider each factor individually and in combinations that have not been previously used. The factors are:

1. An obligee manifests the intention to release an obligor.
2. The manifestation is directed to the obligor.
3. The obligee has an obligation.
4. The obligor is released from the obligation.

Here are the case scenarios based on these factors:

### Case 1: Manifestation of Intention
(1 | N)  
In this scenario, the obligee manifests the intention to release the obligor but does not direct it to the obligor, nor is there confirmation that an obligation exists or that the obligor is released. Since the manifestation alone without direction to the obligor and without an established obligation does not fulfill all conditions for releasing the claim, the defendant remains obligated.

### Case 2: Directed Manifestation
(2 | N)  
Here, the manifestation is directed to the obligor, but there's no indication that the obligee has an intention to release or that an obligation exists. The direction alone, without the intent to release and an existing obligation, does not suffice to release the claim.

### Case 3: Existence of Obligation
(3 | Y)  
In this case, it is established that the obligee has an obligation. However, there's no mention of the obligee manifesting an intention to release or directing such manifestation to the obligor. The mere existence of an obligation means the defendant is still legally bound.

### Case 4: Release from Obligation
(4 | N)  
The obligor is released from the obligation, but without the context of the obligee's intention to release or the direction of this intention to the obligor, and without confirmation of an existing obligation, it cannot be determined that the claim is extinguished based on Article 519 alone. Thus, the defendant might still be obligated under different interpretations.

### Case 5: Manifestation and Directed
(1, 2 | N)  
The obligee manifests the intention to release and directs this manifestation to the obligor. However, without confirmation of an existing obligation or the actual release from it, the conditions for releasing the claim are not fully met according to Article 519.

### Case 6: Manifestation and Obligation Exist
(1, 3 | N)  
Here, the obligee manifests the intention to release, and there is an existing obligation. However, without directing this manifestation to the obligor or confirming the release from the obligation, the claim cannot be considered extinguished.

### Case 7: Directed Manifestation and Obligation
(2, 3 | N)  
The manifestation is directed to the obligor, and there is an existing obligation. Still, without the clear intention of the obligee to release or confirmation that the obligor is released from the obligation, the defendant remains obligated.

### Case 8: Release and Manifestation
(1, 4 | N)  
The obligor is released, and the obligee manifests the intention to release. However, if this manifestation is not directed to the obligor or there's no confirmation of an existing obligation, it's unclear if all conditions for claim extinguishment are met.

### Case 9: Release and Directed Manifestation
(2, 4 | N)  
The obligor is released, and the manifestation is directed to the obligor. Without the clear intention to release or confirmation of an existing obligation, the defendant might still be obligated.

### Case 10: Release and Obligation Exist
(3, 4 | Y)  
There's an existing obligation, and the obligor is released. However, for the claim to be extinguished according to Article 519, the obligee must manifest the intention to release, which is not mentioned here. The mere existence of an obligation and the release do not automatically end the obligation without the obligee's intent.

### Case 11: All Factors Present
(1, 2, 3, 4 | N)  
In this final scenario, all factors are present: the obligee manifests the intention to release, directs it to the obligor, there is an existing obligation, and the obligor is released. According to Article 519, if all these conditions are met, the obligee's claim is actually extinguished, meaning the defendant would not be obligated. However, based on the instructions provided and the format requested, this scenario was mistakenly marked as "N" in error during the explanation process. The correct interpretation according to Article 519 should indeed result in the claim being extinguished when all conditions are met.

Correcting Case 11 for accuracy:
(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)  
Given that all factors are present—manifestation of intention to release, directed to the obligor, existing obligation, and release from the obligation—the defendant is indeed not obligated as the claim is extinguished according to Article 519.

Each case scenario provides a unique combination of factors to determine the legal obligation of the defendant based on Article 519.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze Article 200, I will break down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in applicable cases.

1. A possessor is forcibly dispossessed: This phrase establishes the initial condition for applying the provisions of Article 200, emphasizing the act of forceful dispossession.
2. The possessor may demand the restitution of the thing: This indicates one of the possible remedies available to the possessor who has been forcibly dispossessed, focusing on the return of the possessed item.
3. Compensation for loss or damage: This adds another element of remedy that the possessor can seek, which includes any losses or damages incurred due to the dispossession.
4. By filing an action for recovery of possession: This specifies the legal procedure through which the possessor can seek remedies, highlighting the importance of formal legal action.
5. An action for recovery of possession may not be filed against a specific successor of a person that forcibly takes possession: This introduces a limitation on who can be held liable through such an action, generally protecting successors from liability unless specific conditions are met.
6. Provided, however, that this does not apply if that successor had knowledge of the fact that the person has unlawfully taken the possession: This condition modifies the previous factor by introducing an exception based on the successor's knowledge of the unlawful taking of possession.

Verdict: If a possessor is forcibly dispossessed, the possessor may demand the restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage by filing an action for recovery of possession, unless the action is against a successor without knowledge of the unlawful possession, in which case the successor is generally not liable.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 200, I will generate six legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only the first factor occurs - a possessor is forcibly dispossessed. According to Article 200, this initial condition allows the possessor to demand restitution and compensation, implying that the defendant who forcibly dispossessed them is legally obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, factors 2 and 3 occur - the possessor demands restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage. However, without factor 1 (forcible dispossession), these remedies are not applicable, and without factor 4 (filing an action for recovery of possession), there is no legal procedure to hold the defendant liable. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: Here, only factor 4 occurs - the possessor files an action for recovery of possession. This implies that a forcible dispossession has occurred (factor 1), and the possessor is seeking remedies through the proper legal channel. As such, the defendant who was party to the forcible dispossession would be legally obligated.

(5 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 5 occurs - an action for recovery of possession may not be filed against a specific successor of a person that forcibly takes possession. Without any indication that the successor had knowledge of the unlawful taking (factor 6), the defendant-successor is generally protected from liability and therefore not obligated.

(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors 1 and 4 occur - a possessor is forcibly dispossessed and files an action for recovery of possession. This combination meets all conditions necessary for the possessor to seek remedies, and thus the defendant who was party to the forcible dispossession would be legally obligated.

(5, 6 | Y)
Justification: Here, factors 5 and 6 occur - an action for recovery of possession may not be filed against a specific successor, but that successor had knowledge of the fact that the person has unlawfully taken the possession. The exception in factor 6 overrides the general protection afforded to successors in factor 5, making the defendant-successor with knowledge of the unlawful taking legally obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given Article 200 and the scenario where Professor B leaves book "P" in a train and F finds and possesses it, we need to analyze if B can claim for the restoration of "P" by bringing an action for recovery of possession against F. 

According to Article 200(1), if a possessor is forcibly dispossessed, they may demand restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage by filing an action for recovery of possession. In this case, B was not forcibly dispossessed but rather lost the book through their own actions (leaving it in a train). However, the key aspect here is whether B can be considered as being "forcibly dispossessed" under the article's definition when considering the loss as leading to F's possession.

The critical point is that the dispossession was not direct but resulted from B's actions. Nonetheless, if we consider the spirit of the law aiming to protect possessors and assuming B had a legitimate expectation of continuing possession (as one would with borrowed library material), then B might have grounds for an action against F under certain interpretations, especially if F knew or should have known that the book was lost property rather than abandoned.

However, strictly speaking, since B did not lose "P" through force but through their own carelessness, and there's no direct indication of forceful dispossession as defined in typical legal contexts, one might argue this scenario doesn't perfectly fit Article 200(1)'s initial condition without further legal clarification or expansion of what constitutes "forcible dispossession."

Therefore, based on a strict interpretation of the provided text and assuming standard legal definitions, the query could be seen as False because B's loss does not neatly align with the definition of forcible dispossession. However, this conclusion heavily depends on how one interprets "forcibly dispossessed" in the context of accidental loss leading to another's possession.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A possessor is forcibly dispossessed**: The query does not directly express this factor since B's dispossession was due to carelessness rather than force.
   - (query entails 1) False

2. **The possessor may demand the restitution of the thing**: This factor is expressed as B seeks restoration of "P".
   - (query entails 2) True

3. **Compensation for loss or damage**: The query does not mention compensation, focusing only on restoration.
   - (query entails 3) False

4. **By filing an action for recovery of possession**: This is expressed as B bringing an action against F.
   - (query entails 4) True

5. **An action for recovery of possession may not be filed against a specific successor of a person that forcibly takes possession**: The query does not involve a successor but rather the initial taker (F).
   - (query entails 5) False, as it's not applicable in this scenario.

6. **Provided, however, that this does not apply if that successor had knowledge of the fact that the person has unlawfully taken the possession**: Since F is the initial taker and not a successor, this factor isn't directly relevant.
   - (query entails 6) False

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 in the sense that the query's scenario doesn't perfectly match the conditions outlined in Article 200 for an action for recovery of possession due to the nature of B's dispossession.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given that the analysis suggests B might not have a straightforward case under Article 200(1) due to the nature of their dispossession and considering typical legal definitions, it seems less clear-cut that F would be obligated without further specifics on legal interpretations or additional facts (like F's knowledge or intent).

However, based on standard legal reasoning where finders of lost property may have obligations to return items known to be lost rather than abandoned, one could argue for some level of obligation under different legal principles not directly addressed in Article 200. 

Given the provided framework and sticking strictly to the interpretation of Article 200 as outlined:
- pledged(0) because the scenario doesn't neatly fit the conditions where the defendant (F) would be clearly obligated under Article 200's specific provisions regarding forcible dispossession and actions for recovery of possession.

Please note, real-world legal outcomes can depend on a myriad of factors including jurisdiction-specific laws, interpretations, and additional facts not provided in the query.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 597, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

* The parties specify a period of a loan for use.
* A period of a loan for use has expired.
* The parties do not specify a period of a loan for use.
* The parties specify the purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing.
* The borrower finishes using and making profit from the thing in line with the specified purpose.
* The borrower dies.

Verdict: 
The loan for use is terminated upon the expiration of the specified period, or when the borrower finishes using and making profit from the thing in line with the specified purpose, or upon the death of the borrower.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the factors outlined from Article 597, we will consider each factor as a potential element in a scenario. There are six factors:

1. The parties specify a period of a loan for use.
2. A period of a loan for use has expired.
3. The parties do not specify a period of a loan for use.
4. The parties specify the purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing.
5. The borrower finishes using and making profit from the thing in line with the specified purpose.
6. The borrower dies.

We need to create six unique scenarios, each involving a different combination of these factors, ensuring that no two scenarios are the same and that we can determine a clear verdict based on Article 597 for each scenario.

### Scenario 1: Specified Period Expires
(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Since the parties specified a period for the loan for use (factor 1) and this period has expired (factor 2), according to Article 597(1), the loan for use is terminated. The defendant is obligated to return the borrowed item as the conditions for termination have been met.

### Scenario 2: No Specified Period, Purpose Achieved
(3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: Without a specified period (factor 3) but with a clear purpose for using and making profit from the borrowed thing (factor 4), and the borrower having finished using and making profit from the thing in line with this purpose (factor 5), Article 597(2) dictates that the loan for use is terminated. Thus, the defendant is obligated to return the item.

### Scenario 3: Borrower Dies with No Specified Period or Purpose
(3, 6 | Y)
Justification: Even without a specified period or purpose (factor 3), if the borrower dies (factor 6), according to Article 597(3), the loan for use is terminated. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to return the borrowed item due to the borrower's death.

### Scenario 4: Specified Period but Not Expired
(1 | N)
Justification: If the parties specify a period of a loan for use (factor 1) but this period has not expired, there's no basis under Article 597 for terminating the loan for use yet. Thus, the defendant is not obligated to return the item until the period expires or another condition for termination is met.

### Scenario 5: Specified Purpose but Not Achieved
(4 | N)
Justification: If the parties specify the purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing (factor 4) but the borrower has not finished using and making profit from it in line with this purpose, then according to Article 597(2), the loan for use has not been terminated. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated to return the item until the purpose is achieved or another termination condition is met.

### Scenario 6: Borrower Dies with Specified Period
(1, 2, 6 | Y)
Justification: Even if the parties specified a period (factor 1) and it has expired (factor 2), and considering the borrower's death (factor 6) as an additional condition, Article 597 clearly states that upon the death of the borrower, the loan for use is terminated. Given these factors, especially the expiration of the period and the borrower's death, the defendant is obligated to return the borrowed item.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation based on Article 597.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 15, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder.
2. A request for commencement of assistance can be made by the person in question, that person's spouse, that person's relative within the fourth degree of kinship, the guardian, the guardian's supervisor, the curator, the curator's supervisor, or a public prosecutor.
3. There are grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 that may exclude a person from being subject to commencement of assistance.
4. The issuance of a decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question.
5. A decision for commencement of assistance must be made concurrent with a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1) or a decision as referred to in Article 876-9, paragraph (1).

Verdict: The family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 15, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors.

1. (1 | Y)
In this scenario, the family court has determined that the person's capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder (Factor 1). Given this condition, the court may decide to commence assistance, indicating that the defendant is legally obligated to receive such assistance. Therefore, the verdict is Yes (Y).

2. (2, 4 | Y)
Here, a request for commencement of assistance has been made by an eligible party (Factor 2), and the person in question has given their consent (Factor 4). Since both conditions are met, including the crucial element of consent from the person in question, the defendant is legally obligated to accept the commenced assistance. Thus, the verdict is Yes (Y).

3. (1, 3 | N)
In this case, while the person's capacity to appreciate their situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder (Factor 1), there are grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 that exclude them from being subject to commencement of assistance (Factor 3). The presence of these exclusionary grounds means that the defendant is not legally obligated. Therefore, the verdict is No (N).

4. (2, 5 | Y)
This scenario involves a request for commencement of assistance by an eligible party (Factor 2), and the decision for commencement of assistance is made concurrent with a required decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1) or Article 876-9, paragraph (1) (Factor 5). Given that the procedural requirements are met and assuming no exclusionary grounds apply, the defendant would be legally obligated. Hence, the verdict is Yes (Y).

5. (3, 4 | N)
In this final scenario, there are exclusionary grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 (Factor 3), and the issuance of a decision for commencement of assistance at the request of another requires the consent of the person in question (Factor 4). However, the presence of exclusionary grounds (Factor 3) takes precedence over any potential for obligation based on consent. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated, leading to a verdict of No (N).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To break down Article 295 into its constituent factors for determining the verdict in applicable cases, we'll analyze each sentence and phrase carefully.

1. **A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing**: This establishes the condition under which a possessor might have the right to retain possession of an item not belonging to them.
2. **The claim must have arisen in relation to the thing being possessed**: This specifies that the claim is directly related to the item in question, linking the reason for retention to the item itself.
3. **The possessor may retain that thing until that claim is satisfied**: This outlines the action the possessor can take (retaining possession) and under what condition it ends (when the claim is satisfied).
4. **Provided, however, that this does not apply if the relevant claim has not yet fallen due**: This introduces a limitation on when retention is allowed, specifically excluding claims that are not yet due.
5. **The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if possession commenced by means of a tortious act**: This adds another condition under which the initial provision (regarding retaining an item until a claim is satisfied) does not apply, specifically in cases where the possession began through illegal or wrongful means.

Verdict: A possessor of a thing belonging to another person may retain that thing until their claim related to it is satisfied, unless the claim has not yet fallen due or if the possession started through a tortious act.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 295, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique combination of these factors. Here are the case scenarios:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 is present, where "a possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing." Since the possessor has a legitimate claim related to the item, they may retain possession until the claim is satisfied. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors 2 and 3 are present. The claim must have arisen in relation to the thing being possessed (factor 2), and the possessor may retain that thing until that claim is satisfied (factor 3). Given these conditions, the defendant has a valid reason to retain possession of the item, making them obligated.

(4 | N)
Justification: Here, only factor 4 is present, which states "provided, however, that this does not apply if the relevant claim has not yet fallen due." Since the claim has not yet fallen due, the defendant cannot retain possession of the item. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 5 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 and 5 are present. Although the possessor has a claim related to the item (factor 1), the possession commenced by means of a tortious act (factor 5). According to Article 295, the provisions do not apply if possession began through illegal or wrongful means. Hence, the defendant is not obligated.

(2, 4, 5 | N)
Justification: In this final case, factors 2, 4, and 5 are present. The claim must have arisen in relation to the thing being possessed (factor 2), but the relevant claim has not yet fallen due (factor 4), and the possession commenced by means of a tortious act (factor 5). Given these conditions, the defendant cannot retain possession of the item, as two critical exceptions apply: the claim is not yet due, and the possession began through wrongful means. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 295, yielding a clear verdict on whether the defendant is legally obligated to retain possession of an item belonging to another person.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined, we will proceed step by step:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states: "A right of retention is not established when a secured claim has not yet fallen due." 

According to Article 295(1), a possessor may retain a thing belonging to another person until their claim related to that thing is satisfied, provided that the claim has fallen due. The article explicitly mentions that this right does not apply if the relevant claim has not yet fallen due.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 295, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has a claim that has arisen in relation to that thing**: The query does not directly mention the condition of being a possessor or having a claim related to the thing, but it implies a scenario where a right of retention is considered based on the status of a claim. However, it specifically talks about a "secured claim," which can be interpreted as a claim related to the thing in question. Thus, (query entails 1).

2. **The claim must have arisen in relation to the thing being possessed**: The query does not explicitly state this condition but focuses on the timing of the claim (whether it has fallen due). It implies the relevance of the claim to the thing by discussing a "secured claim" in the context of retention, which suggests a connection to the thing. Thus, (query entails 2).

3. **The possessor may retain that thing until that claim is satisfied**: The query actually negates this factor under specific conditions (when the claim has not yet fallen due), rather than affirming it as a general principle. However, it does imply consideration of retention in relation to claim satisfaction. Thus, (query entails 3) with the understanding that it discusses limitations.

4. **Provided, however, that this does not apply if the relevant claim has not yet fallen due**: This is directly addressed by the query, which states that a right of retention is not established when a secured claim has not yet fallen due. Thus, (query entails 4).

5. **The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if possession commenced by means of a tortious act**: The query does not address how the possession was commenced. It only discusses the timing of the claim in relation to the right of retention. Therefore, it does not express this factor directly. Thus, (query does not entail 5).

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the information and the context provided by Article 295 and the factors analyzed, the query itself does not directly determine whether a defendant is obligated to do something specific (like returning an item or paying a claim). It discusses conditions under which a right of retention applies, specifically focusing on the timing of claims. Therefore, based on the tasks defined, it seems that the query's purpose is more about understanding legal principles rather than obligating a defendant directly.

However, if we interpret "determine the defendant obligated" in the context of whether the query implies any obligation (such as not having a right to retain an item under certain conditions), one could argue that it indirectly speaks to obligations by outlining when retention is not permissible. But this seems to stretch beyond the direct interpretation of the tasks.

Given the strict format and focusing on the direct question: **pledged(0)**, because the query does not directly determine or imply a specific obligation for the defendant in the context provided.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 106, I have broken down the text into key factors:

1. A subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof, meaning the subagent's actions are bound by the limits of their assigned authority.
2. The subagent's representation is specific to acts within the scope of their authority, implying that any actions outside of this scope may not be considered valid representations of the principal.
3. A subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent in relation to the principal, indicating that the subagent shares equal responsibilities and privileges with the original agent.
4. The subagent's rights and obligations are also applicable in relation to third parties, highlighting the importance of considering external interactions when evaluating the subagent's actions.
5. The scope of the subagent's authority determines the extent of their rights and obligations, both towards the principal and third parties.

Verdict: A subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof, and has the same rights and obligations as an agent in relation to the principal and third parties within the scope of that subagent's authority.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 106, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, only factor 1 occurs: A subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof. Since the subagent's actions are bound by the limits of their assigned authority, if they act within that scope, they represent the principal and thus share legal obligations. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

2. (2, 4 | N)
Here, factors 2 and 4 occur: The subagent's representation is specific to acts within the scope of their authority, and their rights and obligations are applicable in relation to third parties. However, since factor 1 (which establishes the initial obligation) is not present, and the actions outside the scope or interactions with third parties without proper authority do not automatically imply a legal obligation on the part of the defendant without direct representation, the defendant is not obligated.

3. (3 | Y)
In this scenario, only factor 3 occurs: A subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent in relation to the principal. This implies that if the subagent acts as an agent would within their authority, they share equal responsibilities and privileges, including legal obligations towards the principal. Thus, the defendant is obligated.

4. (1, 5 | Y)
Factors 1 and 5 are present: The subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof, and the scope of the subagent's authority determines the extent of their rights and obligations towards both the principal and third parties. Given that the subagent's actions are bound by their assigned authority (factor 1) and this authority defines their obligations (factor 5), the defendant is obligated within those defined limits.

5. (2, 3, 4 | Y)
In this final case, factors 2, 3, and 4 occur: The subagent's representation is specific to acts within the scope of their authority, they have the same rights and obligations as an agent in relation to the principal, and these rights and obligations apply in relation to third parties. Since factor 3 establishes that the subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent (implying a basis for legal obligation), and factors 2 and 4 further clarify the scope and applicability of these obligations without negating them, the defendant is obligated, especially considering their equal standing with an agent in terms of responsibilities.

 Let's break down Article 423-7 into its constituent factors:

1. A person has acquired a property by assignment from another person.
2. The property is one for which the acquisition or loss of rights and the change to rights cannot be duly asserted against a third party unless registered.
3. The assignor does not exercise their right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure.
4. The assignee (the person who acquired the property) may exercise the assignor's right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure.

Verdict: A person that has acquired by assignment from another person a property for which the acquisition or loss of rights and the change to rights cannot be duly asserted against a third party unless registered may exercise the assignor's right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure if the assignor does not exercise that right. 

Note: The phrase "In such a case, the provisions of the preceding three Articles apply mutatis mutandis" is an additional consideration but is more about the application of other articles rather than a direct factor in determining the verdict under this specific article. However, it implies:
5. If the assignee exercises the assignor's right to request registration, the provisions of the preceding three Articles will apply with necessary modifications (mutatis mutandis).
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 423-7, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique combination of factors.

1. (1, 2 | N)
In this scenario, a person has acquired a property by assignment from another person (Factor 1), and the property is one for which registration is necessary to assert rights against a third party (Factor 2). However, since Factors 3 and 4 are not present, there is no indication that the assignor failed to exercise their right to request registration or that the assignee is attempting to exercise this right. Without these crucial elements, the defendant cannot be considered legally obligated.

2. (1, 3 | N)
Here, a person has acquired a property by assignment from another person (Factor 1), and the assignor does not exercise their right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure (Factor 3). Despite these factors, without the presence of Factor 2 (the property's nature requiring registration) or Factor 4 (the assignee exercising the right), it cannot be determined that the defendant has a legal obligation under Article 423-7.

3. (1, 4 | N)
In this case, a person has acquired a property by assignment from another person (Factor 1), and the assignee may exercise the assignor's right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure (Factor 4). However, without Factor 2 being present, it is unclear if the property in question requires registration to assert rights against a third party. Furthermore, Factor 3 (assignor not exercising their right) is also absent, which is crucial for determining why the assignee needs to act. Therefore, the defendant cannot be deemed legally obligated.

4. (2, 3 | N)
This scenario involves a property that requires registration to assert rights against a third party (Factor 2), and the assignor does not exercise their right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure (Factor 3). Although these factors suggest a situation where registration is necessary and has not been pursued by the assignor, Factor 1 (acquisition of property by assignment) and Factor 4 (assignee exercising the right) are missing. Without knowing if there was an assignment or if the assignee is taking action, it's impossible to conclude that the defendant is legally obligated under Article 423-7.

5. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
In this comprehensive scenario, all factors are present: a person has acquired a property by assignment from another person (Factor 1), the property requires registration to assert rights against a third party (Factor 2), the assignor does not exercise their right to request registration (Factor 3), and the assignee may exercise the assignor's right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure (Factor 4). Given that all conditions of Article 423-7 are met, including the property's nature, the assignor's inaction, and the assignee's potential action, it is clear that the defendant is legally obligated to ensure the registration process is completed as per the article's provisions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the scenario in Article 423-7 and the query, we can break down the logic as follows:
- The article states that if a person acquires a property from another and the original owner (assignor) does not register the transfer, the new owner (assignee) can request registration directly.
- In the query, B is the assignor who sold the land to A but didn't register the transfer with C, the original owner. The query then states that A may request C to directly transfer the registration to A based on the obligee's right of subrogation.

This aligns with the logic presented in Article 423-7, as it allows the assignee (A) to exercise the right to request registration if the assignor (B) does not. Therefore, logically, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A person has acquired a property by assignment from another person.**
   - Query entails 1: The query mentions that B purchased the land from C and resold it to A, which fits this scenario.

2. **The property is one for which the acquisition or loss of rights and the change to rights cannot be duly asserted against a third party unless registered.**
   - Query entails 2: The query implies the need for registration to assert ownership, suggesting that without registration, rights cannot be duly asserted.

3. **The assignor does not exercise their right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure.**
   - Query entails 3: It's stated in the query that B does not exercise the right to request the registration of the transfer against C.

4. **The assignee (the person who acquired the property) may exercise the assignor's right to request a third party to complete the registration procedure.**
   - Query entails 4: The query directly states that A may request C to directly transfer the registration to A, aligning with this factor.

5. **If the assignee exercises the assignor's right to request registration, the provisions of the preceding three Articles will apply with necessary modifications (mutatis mutandis).**
   - This factor is about the application of other articles and not directly addressed in the query but is a procedural point rather than a condition for the action described.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 that the query is True based on logical reasoning provided by Article 423-7.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the scenario, A (the plaintiff) can request C (the original owner) to register the transfer directly because B (the defendant/assignor) did not exercise this right. This implies an obligation on part of B towards A for not completing the registration process as expected in a normal transaction. Thus, based on the context provided and focusing strictly on obligations related to property transfer and registration:

The final answer is: pledged(1)

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 661, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

* The bailor must compensate the bailee for damage that occurs due to the nature of or defects in the bailed things.
* The nature of or defects in the bailed things causes damage.
* The bailor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect.
* The bailee knew of the nature or defect.

Verdict: The bailor must compensate the bailee for damage that occur due to the nature of or defects in the bailed things; provided, however, that this does not apply if the bailor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect, or the bailee knew of the same.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 661, I will generate four legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1 | Y)
In this scenario, only factor 1 is present: "The bailor must compensate the bailee for damage that occurs due to the nature of or defects in the bailed things." Given that this factor directly states the condition under which the bailor is liable, it is clear that if damage occurs due to the nature or defects of the bailed items, the bailor is obligated to compensate the bailee. Thus, the defendant (bailor) is legally obligated.

2. (2 | N)
Here, only factor 2 is considered: "The nature of or defects in the bailed things causes damage." While this establishes that damage has occurred due to the nature or defects of the bailed items, it does not directly address the liability of the bailor without considering whether the bailor knew of these defects or if the bailee was aware. However, since factor 2 alone doesn't imply ignorance on the part of the bailor or knowledge by the bailee that would exempt liability, and given the context that this factor is a condition for liability rather than an exemption, it suggests the bailor's obligation but does not conclusively determine it without additional context from other factors. However, interpreting strictly within the confines of the instruction to provide a determinate verdict based on the occurrence of this single factor in isolation might suggest the bailor could be seen as obligated due to the damage caused by the nature or defects, yet considering typical legal reasoning and the need for more information (like knowledge of defects), one might argue for "N" if strictly adhering to the idea that only this factor's presence is considered without implying additional unstated conditions. But given the direct implication of liability from the factor itself in a simplified interpretation, it could be argued either way.

3. (3 | N)
In this case, factor 3 applies: "The bailor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect." This factor directly speaks to an exception to the bailor's liability. If the bailor was unaware of the nature or defects and this lack of knowledge was not due to negligence, then according to Article 661, the bailor is not obligated to compensate the bailee for damages caused by those unknown defects. Thus, the defendant (bailor) is not legally obligated.

4. (1, 2, 3 | N)
Here, factors 1, 2, and 3 are all present: The bailor must compensate for damage due to the nature or defects of the bailed things, such damage has occurred, and the bailor did not know of these defects without being negligent. Given factor 3's presence, which indicates the bailor's non-negligent lack of knowledge about the defects, this scenario falls under an exception stated in Article 661 where the bailor is not obligated to compensate if they were unaware (without negligence) of the nature or defect causing damage. Thus, despite factors 1 and 2 suggesting a condition for liability, factor 3's presence leads to the conclusion that the defendant (bailor) is not legally obligated.

5. (4 | N)
For this scenario, only factor 4 is present: "The bailee knew of the nature or defect." According to Article 661, if the bailee knew of the nature or defect, then the bailor is not obligated to compensate for damages caused by those known issues. Thus, in this case, the defendant (bailor) is not legally obligated.

6. (1, 4 | N)
In this scenario, both factor 1 and factor 4 are considered: The bailor must compensate for damage due to the nature or defects of the bailed things, and the bailee knew of the nature or defect. Despite factor 1 generally imposing liability on the bailor for such damages, factor 4 introduces an exception based on the bailee's knowledge. Since Article 661 states that the bailor is not liable if the bailee knew of the nature or defect, the presence of factor 4 overrides the general condition of liability stated in factor 1. Therefore, the defendant (bailor) is not legally obligated.

7. (2, 3 | N)
Here, factors 2 and 3 are present: Damage has occurred due to the nature or defects of the bailed things, and the bailor did not know of these defects without being negligent. The presence of factor 3 indicates an exception to liability as per Article 661, where if the bailor was unaware (without negligence) of the defects causing damage, they are not obligated to compensate. Thus, even though damage has occurred (factor 2), the bailor's non-negligent lack of knowledge (factor 3) means the defendant (bailor) is not legally obligated.

8. (2, 4 | N)
In this case, factors 2 and 4 are present: Damage has occurred due to the nature or defects of the bailed things, and the bailee knew of the nature or defect. The key factor here is factor 4, which states the bailee's knowledge of the nature or defect. According to Article 661, if the bailee was aware, this serves as an exception to the bailor's liability. Therefore, despite damage occurring due to the nature or defects (factor 2), the defendant (bailor) is not legally obligated because the bailee knew of these issues.

9. (3, 4 | N)
Here, factors 3 and 4 are both present: The bailor did not know of the nature or defect without negligence, and the bailee knew of the nature or defect. Both of these factors introduce exceptions to the bailor's liability as outlined in Article 661. Whether it is the bailor's non-negligent lack of knowledge (factor 3) or the bailee's awareness (factor 4), either condition independently justifies the conclusion that the defendant (bailor) is not legally obligated to compensate for damages.

10. (1, 2, 4 | N)
In this final scenario, factors 1, 2, and 4 are all present: The bailor must compensate for damage due to the nature or defects of the bailed things, such damage has occurred, and the bailee knew of the nature or defect. Despite the general condition of liability (factor 1) and the occurrence of damage (factor 2), factor 4's presence indicates that the bailee was aware of the nature or defect. This awareness, as stated in Article 661, serves as an exception to the bailor's liability. Therefore, even with multiple factors suggesting conditions for liability, the exception based on the bailee's knowledge means the defendant (bailor) is not legally obligated.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and yields a clear verdict regarding the defendant's obligation based on Article 661's provisions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 653, I have broken down the text into phrases representing factors used to determine when a mandate terminates. Here is the list:

* The mandator or mandatary dies.
* The mandator or mandatary is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding.
* The mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship.

Verdict: A mandate terminates when any of the following conditions occur: (i) the mandator or mandatary dies; (ii) the mandator or mandatary is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding; or (iii) the mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 653, I have generated three legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs, where the mandator dies. According to Article 653, if the mandator or mandatary dies, the mandate terminates. Since the mandator's death is a terminating condition, the defendant (mandatary) is no longer obligated to perform under the mandate.

(2 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 2 occurs, where the mandator is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding. Article 653 states that if the mandator or mandatary is subject to such an order, the mandate terminates. As a result, the defendant (mandatary) is no longer obligated to perform under the mandate.

(3 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 3 occurs, where the mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship. According to Article 653, this condition also terminates the mandate. Therefore, the defendant (mandatary) is no longer obligated to perform under the mandate.

Note that in each case, the occurrence of at least one terminating condition (as specified in Article 653) leads to the termination of the mandate and releases the defendant from their obligations.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the process step by step.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states: "A mandate shall terminate when the mandatary is subject to an order for the commencement of guardianship."

According to Article 653, a mandate terminates under three conditions:
(i) the mandator or mandatary dies;
(ii) the mandator or mandatary is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding;
(iii) the mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship.

The query directly aligns with condition (iii), which states that a mandate terminates when "the mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship." This implies that the query is essentially restating one of the conditions under which a mandate terminates, albeit using slightly different wording ("order" instead of "decision"). However, in legal contexts, such terms can often be used interchangeably or may refer to similar concepts, depending on the jurisdiction's specific legal language and framework.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided by Article 653, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The mandator or mandatary dies.**
   - The query does not mention death as a condition for mandate termination; thus, it does not express this factor.
   - (query entails 1) is False for this factor.

2. **The mandator or mandatary is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding.**
   - The query does not address bankruptcy proceedings; hence, it does not express this factor.
   - (query entails 2) is False for this factor.

3. **The mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship.**
   - The query directly addresses this condition by stating that a mandate terminates when the mandatary is subject to an order (which can be considered analogous to "a decision" in this context) for the commencement of guardianship.
   - (query entails 3) is True for this factor.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query accurately reflects one of the conditions under which a mandate terminates according to Article 653.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query focuses on the termination of a mandate due to specific circumstances affecting the mandatary (or mandator), without explicitly imposing an obligation on a defendant. It discusses conditions for the termination of a mandate rather than obligations or liabilities of parties involved.

Therefore, the query does not determine the defendant obligated.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 346, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

1. A pledge secures the principal: This indicates that the primary amount is covered by the pledge.
2. A pledge secures the interest: This shows that any accrued interest is also covered by the pledge.
3. A pledge secures the penalties: Penalties associated with the pledge are included in its coverage.
4. A pledge secures the expenses of enforcing the pledge: The costs of enforcing the pledge are secured by the pledge itself.
5. A pledge secures the expense of preserving the thing pledged: Expenses related to maintaining or preserving the pledged item are covered.
6. A pledge secures the compensation of loss or damage arising from failure to perform obligations: Compensation for losses due to non-performance of obligations is included in the pledge's coverage.
7. A pledge secures the compensation of loss or damage arising from latent defects in the thing pledged: The pledge also covers compensation for losses resulting from hidden defects in the pledged item.
8. The act establishing the pledge may provide otherwise: This indicates that specific provisions in the establishment of the pledge can alter its standard coverage.

Verdict: This does not apply if the act establishing the pledge provides otherwise, implying that custom or specific agreement terms can override the general principles outlined in Article 346.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors described in Article 346, I will generate 8 legal case scenarios, each using a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The principal amount is covered by the pledge, which is a fundamental aspect of the agreement. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated to secure the principal.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Both interest and penalties are accrued, and the pledge covers these amounts. Given that the pledge secures both the interest and penalties, the defendant is obligated to pay these amounts.

(4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The costs of enforcing the pledge and preserving the pledged item are significant expenses that the pledge is intended to cover. Since both factors are present, the defendant is legally obligated to secure these expenses.

(6 | N)
Justification: Although compensation for losses due to non-performance of obligations is typically covered by the pledge, in this case, only this factor is present without any other securing aspects (like principal or interest). However, considering the context, if there's no principal or interest secured, and it solely depends on the failure to perform obligations which might not directly tie to a pledge's core function, the defendant might not be obligated purely based on this single aspect, as pledges primarily secure financial amounts or direct damages. Yet, this interpretation may vary depending on specific legal contexts or additional details not provided in the article.

(1, 7 | Y)
Justification: The principal amount is secured, and there are also losses resulting from hidden defects in the pledged item. Given that both critical aspects of the pledge (principal security and compensation for latent defects) are present, the defendant is legally obligated to secure these amounts.

(2, 4, 8 | N)
Justification: Although interest is accrued, and the costs of enforcing the pledge are covered, the presence of factor 8 indicates that the act establishing the pledge may provide otherwise. This suggests that custom or specific agreement terms could override the general principles outlined in Article 346, potentially exempting the defendant from being legally obligated under these specific circumstances.

(3, 6 | Y)
Justification: Penalties are associated with the pledge, and there is compensation for losses due to non-performance of obligations. Given that both penalties (which are a form of secured amount) and compensation for failure to perform obligations are covered, it indicates a comprehensive coverage by the pledge, making the defendant legally obligated.

(5, 7, 8 | Y)
Justification: Expenses related to preserving the pledged item and compensation for losses resulting from latent defects are both covered. Although factor 8 suggests that specific provisions could alter the standard coverage, the combination of these factors (preservation expenses and latent defect compensations) directly relates to the pledge's integrity and value, suggesting that the defendant would still be legally obligated to secure these aspects as they are intrinsic to the pledge's purpose and not merely additional or external conditions that might be subject to override by custom or agreement terms.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 419, I have broken down the text into key factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The amount of compensation for loss or damage is determined with reference to the statutory interest rate as of the time when the obligor first assumes responsibility for the delay.
2. The agreed-upon interest rate prevails if it exceeds the statutory interest rate.
3. The obligee is not required to prove loss or damage with respect to the compensation for loss or damage referred to in paragraph (1).
4. The compensaton for loss or damage refers to the failure to perform an obligation to deliver money.
5. The obligor's assumption of responsibility for the delay is a key factor in determining the amount of compensation.

Verdict: The obligor may not raise the defense of force majeure with respect to the compensation for loss or damage referred to in paragraph (1).
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 419, I have generated five legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs, where the amount of compensation for loss or damage is determined with reference to the statutory interest rate as of the time when the obligor first assumes responsibility for the delay. Since the obligor has assumed responsibility for the delay, they are legally obligated to pay compensation.

(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2 and 4 occur, where the agreed-upon interest rate prevails if it exceeds the statutory interest rate, and the compensation for loss or damage refers to the failure to perform an obligation to deliver money. Since the obligor has failed to perform their obligation to deliver money, and there is an agreed-upon interest rate that applies, they are legally obligated to pay compensation.

(3 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 3 occurs, where the obligee is not required to prove loss or damage with respect to the compensation for loss or damage. However, since there is no indication of any actual obligation or failure to perform, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 and 5 occur, where the amount of compensation for loss or damage is determined with reference to the statutory interest rate as of the time when the obligor first assumes responsibility for the delay, and the obligor's assumption of responsibility for the delay is a key factor in determining the amount of compensation. Since the obligor has assumed responsibility for the delay, they are legally obligated to pay compensation.

(2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2, 3, and 4 occur, where the agreed-upon interest rate prevails if it exceeds the statutory interest rate, the obligee is not required to prove loss or damage with respect to the compensation for loss or damage, and the compensation for loss or damage refers to the failure to perform an obligation to deliver money. Since the obligor has failed to perform their obligation to deliver money, and there are applicable interest rates and no requirement for proof of loss, they are legally obligated to pay compensation.

Note: I have ensured that each case uses a unique combination of factors, as per instruction 3.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given Article 419 and the query, we need to assess if the statement "if person Y gives proof that the delayed performance is not based on the reasons attributable to him or herself, person Y shall be relieved of the liability" aligns with what the article states. According to Article 419(3), "The obligor may not raise the defense of force majeure with respect to the compensation for loss or damage referred to in paragraph (1)." This means that even if the delay is due to reasons beyond the control of the obligor (force majeure), they cannot use this as a defense to avoid paying compensation. Therefore, the query's assertion that person Y can be relieved of liability by proving the delay was not their fault contradicts Article 419(3). Hence, based on logical reasoning, the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The amount of compensation for loss or damage is determined with reference to the statutory interest rate as of the time when the obligor first assumes responsibility for the delay.**
   - (query does not entail 1) The query does not mention how the compensation amount is determined, specifically in relation to the statutory interest rate and the timing of the obligor's assumption of responsibility.

2. **The agreed-upon interest rate prevails if it exceeds the statutory interest rate.**
   - (query does not entail 2) There's no discussion about agreed-upon interest rates versus statutory interest rates in the query.

3. **The obligee is not required to prove loss or damage with respect to the compensation for loss or damage referred to in paragraph (1).**
   - (query does not entail 3) The query talks about person Y giving proof, which implies a requirement for proof, contradicting this factor's principle that no such proof is needed.

4. **The compensation for loss or damage refers to the failure to perform an obligation to deliver money.**
   - (query entails 4) Although indirectly, the context of "delayed performance of loan claim" implies a scenario where there was a failure to deliver money as agreed upon.

5. **The obligor's assumption of responsibility for the delay is a key factor in determining the amount of compensation.**
   - (query does not entail 5) The query focuses on attributability of reasons for delay rather than when the obligor assumes responsibility for it.

Given these assessments, the justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query's premise about being relieved of liability due to proof of non-attributable delay reasons is **False** according to Article 419.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Based on the analysis and given that the query suggests a scenario where person Y might be relieved of liability under certain conditions (which contradicts Article 419's stance on force majeure), but actually, according to Article 419, the obligor cannot avoid liability by proving the delay was due to reasons beyond their control. Therefore, in the context provided by Article 419 and its application to similar scenarios:

- **pledged(0)** if we strictly interpret the query's intention to relieve person Y of liability, which is not supported.
- However, considering the spirit of Task 3 might be about whether there's an obligation based on standard legal interpretations related to Article 419, it seems there was a misunderstanding in directly applying the task instructions without considering the nuanced analysis provided. The correct approach should reflect that according to Article 419, the obligor is indeed obligated to pay compensation regardless of force majeure, which contradicts the query's premise but aligns with the idea that generally, under this article, an obligor would be considered obligated.

Given the specific format and instructions for Task 3 and recognizing a need to clarify based on the detailed analysis:

The final answer is: $\boxed{pledged(0)}$

 After carefully reading Article 398-20, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

1. The principal secured by a revolving mortgage is crystallized if the revolving mortgagee has filed a petition for auction or execution against earnings from immovable collateral or attachment under the provisions of Article 304 as applied mutatis mutandis pursuant to Article 372.
2. The commencement of either auction procedures or execution procedures against earnings from immovable collateral, or an attachment must have been effected for the principal secured to be crystallized in the case of a petition filed by the revolving mortgagee.
3. If the revolving mortgagee has effected an attachment for disposition of delinquency against the mortgaged immovables, the principal secured is crystallized.
4. The passage of two weeks from the time when the revolving mortgagee acquired knowledge of the commencement of auction procedures or attachment for disposition of delinquency against the mortgaged immovables results in the crystallization of the principal secured.
5. If the obligor or mortgagor of the revolving mortgage has become subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding, the principal secured is crystallized.

Verdict: The principal secured by a revolving mortgage is deemed not to have been crystallized if the commencement of auction procedures, attachment under item (iii), or order commencing bankruptcy proceeding ceases to be effective.
Verdict: However, the principal secured is still considered crystallized if a person has acquired that revolving mortgage or a right for which the revolving mortgage is the subject matter on the assumption that the principal was crystallized.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 398-20, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a unique combination of factors and determines whether the principal secured by a revolving mortgage is crystallized, thus potentially obligating the defendant.


## Case Scenario 1:
(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the revolving mortgagee has filed a petition for auction or execution against earnings from immovable collateral or attachment under the provisions of Article 304. According to factor 1, this action alone is sufficient for the principal secured to be crystallized, indicating the defendant's obligation.


## Case Scenario 2:
(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Here, we combine factors 2 and 3. Factor 2 specifies that the commencement of auction procedures or execution procedures must have been effected following a petition by the revolving mortgagee, which is not directly relevant to factor 3. However, factor 3 states that if the revolving mortgagee has effected an attachment for disposition of delinquency against the mortgaged immovables, the principal secured is crystallized. Since factor 3's condition is met, and given that factor 2 does not negate but rather supports the action under specific circumstances, the principal secured would be considered crystallized, indicating the defendant's obligation.


## Case Scenario 3:
(4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, two weeks have passed since the revolving mortgagee acquired knowledge of the commencement of auction procedures or attachment for disposition of delinquency against the mortgaged immovables (factor 4). This timeframe's passage alone is enough to crystallize the principal secured, according to the article. Thus, the defendant would be obligated.


## Case Scenario 4:
(5 | Y)
Justification: Factor 5 states that if the obligor or mortgagor of the revolving mortgage has become subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding, the principal secured is crystallized. This scenario directly triggers crystallization based on the obligor's or mortgagor's financial situation, indicating the defendant's obligation.


## Case Scenario 5:
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: Although this combination includes all factors and might seem redundant, it represents a comprehensive scenario where every condition for crystallization is met. The presence of factor 2 ensures that not only has a petition been filed (factor 1), but the necessary procedures have also commenced. Factor 3 indicates an attachment for disposition of delinquency, factor 4 confirms the passage of time since knowledge of certain actions was acquired, and factor 5 introduces bankruptcy proceedings against the obligor or mortgagor. Given that all conditions are satisfied, the principal secured would undoubtedly be crystallized, confirming the defendant's obligation.


The final answer is: $\boxed{(1 | Y), (2, 3 | Y), (4 | Y), (5 | Y), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)}$

======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the provided factors from Article 28 and Article 103, we will create eight unique cases, each assuming a different subset of these factors has occurred. We will then provide a justification for determining whether the defendant (in this context, likely an administrator or agent) is legally obligated based on the occurrence of these factors.

1. **Case Scenario:** (1 | Y)
   - **Factors Involved:** An administrator needs to perform an act exceeding the authority provided for in Article 103.
   - **Justification:** The defendant is legally obligated because they are attempting to exceed their given authority, which necessitates further legal review or permission.

2. **Case Scenario:** (2 | Y)
   - **Factors Involved:** The administrator may perform that act after obtaining the permission of the family court.
   - **Justification:** The defendant is legally obligated to obtain permission from the family court before performing acts beyond their defined authority, ensuring they operate within legal bounds.

3. **Case Scenario:** (3 | N)
   - **Factors Involved:** It is unclear whether the absentee is dead or alive.
   - **Justification:** The uncertainty regarding the status of the absentee does not inherently obligate the defendant to any specific action without additional context or factors.

4. **Case Scenario:** (1, 3 | Y)
   - **Factors Involved:** An administrator needs to perform an act exceeding the authority provided for in Article 103, and it is unclear whether the absentee is dead or alive.
   - **Justification:** Given the uncertainty about the absentee's status and the need to exceed authority, the defendant is obligated to seek permission from the family court to ensure legal compliance.

5. **Case Scenario:** (4 | Y)
   - **Factors Involved:** The administrator needs to perform an act exceeding the authority established by the absentee.
   - **Justification:** Exceeding the authority set by the absentee necessitates a legal obligation to either obtain permission or face potential legal consequences for overstepping bounds.

6. **Case Scenario:** (5, 6 | Y)
   - **Factors Involved:** An agent has no specifically defined authority, and the agent has the authority to perform acts of preservation.
   - **Justification:** Despite lacking specific authority, the agent is legally obligated to act within their implied powers for preservation, which does not require explicit permission but still binds them to certain responsibilities.

7. **Case Scenario:** (7 | Y)
   - **Factors Involved:** The agent has the authority to perform acts with the purpose of using or improving a thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency.
   - **Justification:** The defendant is obligated to use their authority for the intended purposes of improvement or use, as this falls within their implied duties as an agent.

8. **Case Scenario:** (5, 7, 8 | Y)
   - **Factors Involved:** An agent has no specifically defined authority, the agent has the authority to perform acts with the purpose of using or improving a thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency, and the act of using or improving a thing or right does not change the nature of that thing or right.
   - **Justification:** The defendant is legally obligated because they must operate within the parameters that allow for use or improvement without altering the fundamental nature of the subject matter, ensuring they act responsibly and ethically as an agent.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the legal obligations of the defendant.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False

The query states that B, appointed by the family court as the administrator of A's property (A being an absentee), doesn't need to obtain permission from the family court when paying a debt obligation due to E for the benefit of A. 

According to Article 28 and Article 103, if an act exceeds the authority provided for in Article 103 or if it is unclear whether the absentee is dead or alive and the administrator needs to perform an act exceeding the established authority, permission from the family court is required.

However, paying a debt obligation that is due can be considered an act of preservation (as it preserves the financial integrity of A's estate by avoiding potential penalties or legal issues arising from unpaid debts) under Article 103. Since using or improving a thing/right without changing its nature includes managing debts for the benefit of the absentee, this action aligns with the authority granted to agents with no specifically defined authority.

Thus, based on logical reasoning and considering the articles provided, the query seems to be **True** because paying off debt can be seen as an act that preserves or improves A's estate without changing its nature, which is within the administrator's authority under Article 103.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. An administrator needs to perform an act exceeding the authority provided for in Article 103.
   - (query does not entail 1) because paying a debt due can be seen as preserving A's estate, which is within the administrator's authority.

2. The administrator may perform that act after obtaining the permission of the family court.
   - (query does not entail 2) since it specifically states B doesn't need to obtain permission for paying the debt.

3. It is unclear whether the absentee is dead or alive.
   - (query does not entail 3) as the query does not mention any uncertainty about A's status.

4. The administrator needs to perform an act exceeding the authority established by the absentee.
   - (query does not entail 4) because paying a debt is likely within the scope of preserving the estate and thus not necessarily exceeding any established authority.

5. An agent has no specifically defined authority.
   - (query entails 5) since B's specific authorities aren't detailed, implying they might be acting under general administrative powers.

6. The agent has the authority to perform acts of preservation.
   - (query entails 6) because paying off a debt can be considered an act of preservation.

7. The agent has the authority to perform acts with the purpose of using or improving a thing or right that is the subject matter of the agency.
   - (query entails 7) as managing A's debts could improve the estate by avoiding potential complications.

8. The act of using or improving a thing or right does not change the nature of that thing or right.
   - (query entails 8) since paying off debt maintains the financial integrity without altering the fundamental nature of A's estate.

These justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1, supporting the query as True based on the articles provided.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given that B is performing an action (paying a debt) for the benefit of A without needing additional permission, this scenario does not inherently imply that B or any defendant is obligated in a new manner. The query focuses on the administrator's authority and actions rather than establishing or denying obligations.

Therefore, **pledged(0)** because the query does not determine the defendant to be obligated; it discusses the scope of the administrator's authority in managing the absentee's estate.

 After carefully reading Article 496, I have broken down the text into key factors and identified the verdict sentence. Here is the result:

Factors:
1. The obligee does not accept the deposit.
2. The judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding.
3. A pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit.

Verdict: 
The performer may recover the deposited thing, and it is deemed that no deposit has been effected, unless a pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit, in which case the provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 496, I will generate three legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a unique subset of the factors and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant (performer) is legally obligated.

### Case Scenario 1:
(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only Factor 1 occurs - the obligee does not accept the deposit. According to Article 496, if the obligee does not accept the deposit, the performer may recover the deposited thing, and it is deemed that no deposit has been effected. This implies that the defendant (performer) is not obligated since they can recover their deposit.

### Case Scenario 2:
(2 | N)
Justification: Here, only Factor 2 is present - the judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding. Similar to the reasoning in Case Scenario 1, if the judgment is not final, the performer may recover the deposited thing because it's deemed that no deposit has been effected. Thus, the defendant (performer) is not obligated.

### Case Scenario 3:
(3 | Y)
Justification: In this case, Factor 3 occurs - a pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit. According to Article 496, if a pledge or mortgage has been extinguished due to the deposit, the provisions allowing the performer to recover the deposited thing do not apply. This means that despite the initial conditions for recovery being met (e.g., non-acceptance by the obligee or non-final judgment), the defendant (performer) is still obligated because a pledge or mortgage was affected.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors, ensuring no duplication and providing clear determinations regarding the defendant's obligations based on Article 496.

* Property rights of the family members have not been infringed (as a condition that does not affect the obligation to compensate)

Verdict: A person that has taken the life of another must compensate for loss or damage to the father, mother, spouse, and children of the victim, even if the property rights of the same have not been infringed.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 711, I have identified 5 factors. Here are 5 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors:

(1 | N)
Justification: The only factor present in this case is that "a person has taken the life of another". However, there is no indication that compensation for loss or damage is owed to any family members. According to Article 711, the obligation to compensate arises when there are specific family members (father, mother, spouse, children) who have suffered a loss. Since this factor alone does not establish an obligation to compensate, the defendant is not obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, "the person must compensate for loss or damage" and "the compensation is owed to specific family members". However, there is no indication that the person has actually taken a life. Article 711 requires both the taking of a life and the presence of family members who have suffered a loss in order to establish an obligation to compensate. Since this combination of factors does not meet these requirements, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 3 | Y)
Justification: Here, "a person has taken the life of another" and "the compensation is owed to specific family members". Although Article 711 also mentions that the person must compensate for loss or damage, it can be inferred that the taking of a life will result in some form of loss or damage to the victim's family members. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to compensate.

(2, 4 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, "the person must compensate for loss or damage" and "property rights of the family members have not been infringed". However, there is no indication that a life has been taken or that there are specific family members who have suffered a loss. Article 711 requires both the taking of a life and the presence of family members who have suffered a loss in order to establish an obligation to compensate. Since this combination of factors does not meet these requirements, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: This case includes all factors: "a person has taken the life of another", "the person must compensate for loss or damage", "the compensation is owed to specific family members", and "property rights of the family members have not been infringed". According to Article 711, when a person takes the life of another, they must compensate the victim's family members (father, mother, spouse, children) for their loss, regardless of whether property rights were affected. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to compensate.

Note: Since factor 5 was not explicitly listed in the original breakdown, I assumed it meant "property rights of the family members have been considered" or simply included all factors as a comprehensive scenario. If this assumption is incorrect, please clarify the meaning of factor 5.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof.
2. Servitudes are subject to other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land.
3. The act establishing the servitude may provide otherwise, which can affect the transfer of servitudes.
4. Servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land.
5. Servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land.
6. Acquisitions of real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties.
7. Losses of real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties.
8. Changes in real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties.
9. Registration of real rights on immovables is subject to the applicable provisions of the Real Property Registration Act (Act No. 123 of 2004) and other laws regarding registration.

Verdict: Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof, and acquisitions, losses, or changes in real rights on immovables may not be duly asserted against any third parties unless registered pursuant to the applicable provisions.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 9 unique legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof. If the defendant is the owner of the dominant land, they are obligated to transfer the servitude along with the land.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Although servitudes are subject to other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land, the act establishing the servitude may provide otherwise. In this case, the specific terms of the act take precedence, and if they exempt the defendant from transferring the servitude, then the defendant is not obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: Servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land. If the defendant attempts to transfer a servitude separately, they are in violation of this principle and are therefore obligated to comply with the law.

(5, 1 | Y)
Justification: Servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land, and they are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof. If the defendant tries to create a separate right related to the servitude without transferring the dominant land, they are obligated to rectify this situation.

(6 | Y)
Justification: Acquisitions of real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties. If the defendant fails to register an acquisition, they are obligated to do so in order to establish their claim.

(7, 9 | Y)
Justification: Losses of real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties, and registration is subject to the applicable provisions of the Real Property Registration Act (Act No. 123 of 2004) and other laws regarding registration. If the defendant fails to register a loss in accordance with these laws, they are obligated to comply with the registration requirements.

(8 | Y)
Justification: Changes in real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties. If the defendant makes a change without registering it, they are obligated to register the change in order to establish their claim.

(2, 6 | N)
Justification: Although servitudes are subject to other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land, and acquisitions of real rights on immovables must be registered, these factors do not directly obligate the defendant if they have complied with registration requirements for the dominant land but not specifically for the servitude.

(3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The act establishing the servitude may provide otherwise, but servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land, and servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land. If the defendant attempts to circumvent these restrictions through a special provision in the act, they are still obligated to comply with the overarching principles governing servitudes and are therefore pledged to adhere to them.

Task Definition:

Task 1:
Given a set of articles, determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Task 2:
Given the query and a list of factors, assess whether the query expresses each factor. The query expresses a factor if it considers evidence within a similar situation or scenario as the factor. Justify your reasoning for all factors. Then, verify whether your justifications align with the result from Task 1. Then you must output following format: (query entails X) if query entails factor X.


Task 3:
Determine whether the query determine the defendant obligated. If yes, represent it as format pledged(1). If not, present it as pledged(0).
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if the establishment of a servitude has been registered for the servient land, and the dominant land is transferred, the transferee may assert the transfer of the servitude against a third party if the transfer of ownership of the dominant land is registered. 

Based on Article 281(1), servitudes are indeed transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof, implying that when the dominant land changes hands, the servitude goes with it. Furthermore, Article 177 stipulates that acquisitions (which would include transfers of real rights like servitudes) must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties.

Therefore, logically, if the transfer of ownership of the dominant land is registered, and considering that servitudes are appurtenances of the dominant land, it follows that the transferee can assert the transfer of the servitude against a third party. Hence, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning for all factors.

1. Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof.
   - (query entails 1) because it implies that when the dominant land is transferred, the servitude goes with it, aligning with this principle.

2. Servitudes are subject to other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land.
   - The query does not directly address this aspect but focuses on transfer and registration. Thus, it doesn't explicitly entail factor 2.

3. The act establishing the servitude may provide otherwise, which can affect the transfer of servitudes.
   - The query does not mention any specific conditions from the act establishing the servitude, so it doesn't directly entail this factor.

4. Servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land.
   - (query entails 4) because the scenario described involves the transfer of the dominant land and implies that the servitude's transfer is contingent upon this, suggesting that the servitude isn't being transferred separately.

5. Servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land.
   - Similar to factor 2, this aspect isn't directly addressed in the query, so it doesn't explicitly entail factor 5.

6. Acquisitions of real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties.
   - (query entails 6) as it mentions that the transferee may assert the transfer of the servitude if the transfer of ownership of the dominant land is registered, aligning with this requirement for registration.

7. Losses of real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties.
   - The query does not address losses but rather transfers (acquisitions), so it doesn't entail factor 7.

8. Changes in real rights on immovables must be registered to be duly asserted against third parties.
   - While the query focuses on a transfer, which could be seen as a change, it specifically talks about acquisition through transfer and registration, indirectly touching upon this but not explicitly addressing all changes (e.g., modifications). Thus, it partially entails factor 8.

9. Registration of real rights on immovables is subject to the applicable provisions of the Real Property Registration Act (Act No. 123 of 2004) and other laws regarding registration.
   - The query does imply that registration is necessary for asserting rights against third parties but doesn't specifically mention being subject to the mentioned act or other laws, so it indirectly entails factor 9 without directly referencing these provisions.

The justifications align with the result from Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is **True** based on the principles outlined in the articles.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated. If yes, represent it as pledged(1). If not, present it as pledged(0).

Given the context of the tasks and the information provided, there isn't explicit mention of a defendant or obligations that would directly tie to determining an obligation based on the query's truth value or its entailment of factors. The query primarily addresses the procedural aspect of servitude transfer and registration rather than obligations or liabilities of parties involved.

However, interpreting the task in the context of whether the scenario described imposes any obligations (e.g., the need for registration to assert rights), one could argue that there are procedural obligations implied for those involved in the transfer of dominant land and associated servitudes. Yet, without direct reference to a defendant or specific obligations beyond procedural requirements, this interpretation might not fully align with the task's intent.

Therefore, based on the information provided and focusing strictly on determining an obligation as it pertains to legal responsibilities or liabilities (which are not explicitly outlined in the query), the output would be **pledged(0)**. This conclusion reflects that the query itself does not directly impose or determine a specific obligation of a defendant within the context given.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 705, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article:

1. A person has paid money or delivered something: This phrase indicates that an action of payment or delivery has been taken by an individual.
2. The payment or delivery is made as performance of an obligation: This factor clarifies that the action was done with the intention of fulfilling a perceived obligation.
3. The person knew, at the time, that the obligation did not exist: This phrase highlights the importance of the person's knowledge regarding the existence of the obligation at the time of payment or delivery.

Verdict: A person that has paid money or delivered anything as performance of an obligation may not demand the return of the money paid or thing delivered if the person knew, at the time, that the obligation did not exist.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 705, I will generate three legal case scenarios, each assuming a subset of the factors occurred.


## Case 1: Payment without Knowledge of Obligation
(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, a person has paid money (factor 1), but there is no information about whether the payment was made as performance of an obligation (factor 2) or if the person knew the obligation did not exist (factor 3). Since the payment could have been made for various reasons and not necessarily to fulfill an obligation, and without knowledge of the non-existence of the obligation, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.


## Case 2: Payment as Performance of Obligation without Knowledge
(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Here, a person has paid money (factor 1) with the intention of fulfilling an obligation (factor 2), but there's no mention of whether they knew the obligation didn't exist (factor 3). Given that the payment was made to fulfill an obligation, it suggests the defendant acknowledged and acted on an obligation they believed existed. Thus, based on their action and intent, we can argue the defendant is obligated.


## Case 3: Knowledge of No Obligation with Payment as Performance
(1, 2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, all factors are present: a person paid money (factor 1), did so as performance of an obligation (factor 2), and knew at the time that the obligation did not exist (factor 3). According to Article 705, if a person knew there was no obligation at the time of payment or delivery, they cannot demand the return of what was paid or delivered. This directly implies the defendant is not obligated to return the money or item, aligning with the article's stipulation.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 11 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the manifestation of intention is based on a mistake. According to Article 95, a manifestation of intention is voidable if it is based on a mistake. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the mistake is material in light of the purpose of the juridical act and the common sense in the transaction, and the mistake is either a lack of intention or an understanding that does not correspond to the truth. According to Article 95, these conditions render the manifestation of intention voidable. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(4 | N)
Justification: In this case, the circumstances in question are being taken as the basis for the juridical act, and this has been indicated. However, this factor alone does not necessarily render the manifestation of intention voidable. According to Article 95, this indication is only a requirement for rescinding a manifestation of intention based on a mistake under item (ii). Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(5 | N)
Justification: In this case, the mistake is due to gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention. According to Article 95, if a mistake is due to gross negligence, that person may not rescind a manifestation of intention, except in certain cases. Since none of those exceptions are present in this case, the defendant is not obligated.

(6 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the other party knew or did not know due to gross negligence of the mistake on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention. According to Article 95, this knowledge or gross negligence can be an exception to the rule that a mistake due to gross negligence cannot be rescinded. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(7 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the other party was under the same mistake as the person making the manifestation of intention. According to Article 95, this shared mistake can also be an exception to the rule that a mistake due to gross negligence cannot be rescinded. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(8 | N)
Justification: In this case, a third party is acting in good faith without negligence. According to Articles 95 and 96, the rescission of a manifestation of intention may not be duly asserted against such a third party. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(9 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the manifestation of intention is based on fraud or duress. According to Article 96, a manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(10 | Y)
Justification: In this case, a third party commits a fraud inducing a first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party. According to Article 96, such a manifestation of intention can be voidable if the second party knew or could have known about the fraud. Although that factor is not present in this case, the fact that a third party committed fraud can still render the manifestation of intention voidable under certain circumstances. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(11 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the second party knew or could have known that the manifestation of intention was induced by fraud. According to Article 96, if the second party had such knowledge, the manifestation of intention can be rescinded. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(1, 5 | N)
Justification: In this case, the manifestation of intention is based on a mistake, and the mistake is due to gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention. According to Article 95, if a mistake is due to gross negligence, that person may not rescind a manifestation of intention, except in certain cases. Since none of those exceptions are present in this case, the defendant is not obligated.

Note: I have added an additional case (1, 5 | N) to meet the requirement of generating 11 case scenarios, as there were only 10 factors initially provided. This new case combines factor 1 with factor 5, ensuring that no two cases use the same combination of factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 620, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article.

* A lease is cancelled: This phrase represents the initial condition or event that triggers the application of Article 620.
* The cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future: This phrase highlights the scope and timing of the cancellation, emphasizing that it only affects future actions or obligations.
* The cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage: This phrase indicates that cancellation of a lease does not automatically waive any rights to seek compensation for losses or damages incurred.

Verdict: In such a case, the cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 620, I have identified 3 key factors. Here are 3 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the first factor "A lease is cancelled" occurred. However, since the cancellation's effect on future actions or obligations and its impact on claims for compensation are unknown, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the second factor "The cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future" and the third factor "The cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage" occurred. Given that the cancellation's effect is limited to the future and claims for compensation are still possible, it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant is obligated to consider potential losses or damages.

(1, 2 | N)
Justification: In this case, the first factor "A lease is cancelled" and the second factor "The cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future" occurred. Although the lease is cancelled and its effects are limited to the future, we do not have information about the possibility of claiming compensation for losses or damages. Therefore, we cannot determine that the defendant is obligated.

Note: Since there are only 3 factors, we can generate a maximum of 2^3 - 1 = 7 possible combinations (excluding the empty set). However, to meet the instruction of generating a number of case scenarios equal to the number of factors, I have provided 3 scenarios.

Task Definition:

Task 1:
Given a set of articles, determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Task 2:
Given the query and a list of factors, assess whether the query expresses each factor. The query expresses a factor if it considers evidence within a similar situation or scenario as the factor. Justify your reasoning for all factors. Then, verify whether your justifications align with the result from Task 1. Then you must output following format: (query entails X) if query entails factor X.


Task 3:
Determine whether the query determine the defendant obligated. If yes, represent it as format pledged(1). If not, present it as pledged(0).

======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that if a lease contract is canceled, the lease shall terminate retroactively as of the time of the conclusion of the contract. However, Article 620 indicates that the cancellation of a lease becomes effective solely toward the future, meaning it does not have retroactive effects back to the beginning of the contract. Therefore, based on this article, the query is False.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **A lease is cancelled**: The query directly mentions the cancellation of a lease contract, which aligns with this factor.
   - (query entails A lease is cancelled)

2. **The cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future**: The query contradicts this by stating that the lease shall terminate retroactively, implying an effect on the past rather than solely the future.
   - (query does not entail The cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future)

3. **The cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage**: The query does not address the issue of compensation for loss or damage, focusing instead on the timing and nature of the lease termination.
   - (query does not entail The cancellation does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage)

Justification aligns with Task 1's conclusion that the query is False based on Article 620.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query discusses the termination of a lease contract but does not explicitly address whether the defendant is obligated to any specific actions or compensations following the cancellation. Since it focuses on the timing and effect of the cancellation rather than obligations, the query does not directly determine the defendant's obligations.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The land and a building on that land belong to the same owner.
2. A mortgage is created with respect to that land or building.
3. The enforcement of that mortgage causes the land and the building to belong to different owners.

Verdict: It is deemed that a superficies has been created with respect to that building, and in this case, the rent is fixed by the court at the request of the parties.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the provided factors from Article 388 regarding Statutory Superficies, we will create combinations of these factors to determine whether a defendant would be legally obligated. The factors are:

1. The land and a building on that land belong to the same owner.
2. A mortgage is created with respect to that land or building.
3. The enforcement of that mortgage causes the land and the building to belong to different owners.

Here are the case scenarios based on combinations of these factors:

1. (1 | N)  
Justification: If only the first factor occurs (the land and a building on that land belong to the same owner), without any mortgage or change in ownership due to enforcement, there's no basis for creating a superficies or obligating the defendant under Article 388.

2. (2 | N)  
Justification: The creation of a mortgage alone, without affecting the ownership or leading to a situation where the land and building belong to different owners, does not trigger the conditions necessary for the creation of a superficies as described in Article 388.

3. (3 | N)  
Justification: This scenario is impossible according to the given factors since factor 3 (the enforcement of that mortgage causes the land and the building to belong to different owners) cannot occur without first having a mortgage (factor 2). However, assuming it could, if only this condition were somehow met without the initial common ownership or mortgage creation explicitly stated, it would still not directly apply because the scenario lacks clarity on how the mortgage was created. Yet, for logical consistency in generating scenarios, we acknowledge that factor 3 inherently implies factors 1 and 2 occurred prior. The correct interpretation should be that if only factor 3 is considered (ignoring its prerequisites), it doesn't directly apply to obligate without the context of a mortgage.

4. (1, 2 | N)  
Justification: Even with the land and building belonging to the same owner and a mortgage created, as long as the enforcement of the mortgage does not cause them to belong to different owners, the conditions for creating a superficies under Article 388 are not fully met.

5. (1, 3 | Y)  
Justification: Although factor 3 implies that factors 1 and 2 must have occurred (common ownership initially, a mortgage created, and then enforcement leading to different ownership), if we consider the combination of just factors 1 and 3 for the sake of generating scenarios, it suggests a situation where the initial common ownership and the change in ownership due to mortgage enforcement are key. However, this scenario is somewhat forced because factor 3 cannot happen without factor 2. For logical consistency and following instructions precisely, we must recognize that if only these two factors are "considered" (with the understanding that factor 2's occurrence is implied for factor 3 to be relevant), it would indeed lead to a superficies being deemed created.

6. (2, 3 | Y)  
Justification: This scenario directly implies all conditions necessary for Article 388 to apply have been met: a mortgage was created (factor 2), and its enforcement led to the land and building belonging to different owners (factor 3). The initial common ownership is implied as a prerequisite for factor 3. Thus, a superficies would be deemed created, obligating the parties involved.

7. (1, 2, 3 | Y)  
Justification: With all factors present—initial common ownership of the land and building, creation of a mortgage, and enforcement causing different ownership—the conditions under Article 388 are fully met for a superficies to be deemed created. The defendant would indeed be legally obligated in this scenario.

Each case provides a clear verdict based on the combination of factors considered, adhering to the instructions provided.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 32, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The family court receives proof that a missing person is alive.
2. The family court receives proof that a missing person died at a time different from the time set forth in the preceding Article.
3. A request is made by the missing person or an interested person to rescind the declaration of disappearance.
4. The declaration of disappearance was made prior to the receipt of new proof.
5. Acts were performed in good faith after the declaration of disappearance but before its rescission.
6. A person has acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance.
7. The rescission of the declaration of disappearance occurs.

Verdict: The family court must rescind the declaration of that person's disappearance, and the rescission does not affect the validity of any act performed in good faith after the declaration of disappearance but before the rescission thereof.
Verdict: A person who has acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance loses the rights in question due to its rescission; provided, however, that the person has the obligation to return that property only to the extent currently enriched.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The family court receives proof that a missing person is alive, which triggers the obligation to rescind the declaration of disappearance. As the missing person or an interested person can request the rescission, it is likely that such a request will be made, and thus the defendant (e.g., the family court) is obligated to take action.

(2 | Y)
Justification: Similar to case 1, if the family court receives proof that a missing person died at a time different from the time set forth in the preceding Article, it must rescind the declaration of disappearance. The defendant is therefore obligated to act upon receiving such proof.

(3 | N)
Justification: A request by the missing person or an interested person to rescind the declaration of disappearance does not automatically create an obligation for the defendant without additional factors being present (e.g., proof of the missing person's status). Therefore, the defendant is not obligated solely based on this factor.

(1, 3 | Y)
Justification: When combined with a request from the missing person or an interested person (factor 3), the family court receiving proof that a missing person is alive (factor 1) creates a clear obligation to rescind the declaration of disappearance. The defendant must act upon this combination of factors.

(4, 6 | Y)
Justification: If a declaration of disappearance was made prior to the receipt of new proof (factor 4), and a person has acquired property due to that declaration (factor 6), then upon rescission of the declaration, the person who acquired the property is obligated to return it. The defendant in this scenario would be the person who acquired the property.

(5 | N)
Justification: Acts performed in good faith after the declaration of disappearance but before its rescission do not create an obligation for the defendant. In fact, according to Article 32, such acts remain valid even after the rescission, indicating no obligation arises solely from this factor.

(2, 6, 7 | Y)
Justification: When proof is received that a missing person died at a time different from the time set forth in the preceding Article (factor 2), and a person has acquired property due to the declaration of disappearance (factor 6), and the rescission of the declaration occurs (factor 7), the person who acquired the property loses their rights to it. The defendant is obligated to return the property, but only to the extent they are currently enriched.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. Two persons bear an obligation to each other that has the same kind of purpose.
2. Both obligations are due.
3. The nature of the obligation does not permit a set-off.
4. A party manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off.
5. The manifestation of the intention is asserted against a third party.
6. The third party knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the manifestation of the intention.

Verdict: Each obligor may be relieved from the obligation by setting off the value of that obligation against the corresponding amount of the obligation of the other obligor, unless the nature of the obligation does not permit such a set-off or a party has manifested an intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article, I will generate six legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, only factor 1 is present, meaning two persons bear an obligation to each other that has the same kind of purpose. Although this alone does not necessarily determine the defendant's obligation, it sets the stage for a potential set-off. Given that no restrictions or prohibitions are mentioned (factors 3 and 4), and both obligations being due is implied as part of the context (factor 2), the defendant can be considered obligated to participate in the set-off process, yielding a verdict of Y.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2 and 3 are present. Both obligations are due (factor 2), but the nature of the obligation does not permit a set-off (factor 3). Since the nature of the obligation is the determining factor here, and it explicitly does not allow for a set-off, the defendant cannot be relieved from the obligation through set-off, resulting in a verdict of N.

(4 | Y)
Justification: Here, only factor 4 is present, indicating a party manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off. This manifestation implies that there are underlying obligations between parties (factor 1) and potentially due obligations (factor 2), but the explicit intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off means the defendant cannot use set-off as a means to relieve their obligation without violating this manifested intention, leading to a verdict of Y.

(5 | N)
Justification: In this case, factor 5 is present, meaning the manifestation of the intention is asserted against a third party. However, without knowledge of whether the third party knew or did not know due to gross negligence (factor 6), and lacking information on the obligations themselves (factors 1 and 2), we cannot determine the defendant's obligation based solely on this factor. Given the ambiguity, it leans towards the defendant not being obligated under these specific, isolated circumstances, resulting in a verdict of N.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Factors 1 and 2 are present here, indicating two persons have obligations to each other with the same kind of purpose, and both obligations are due. Since there's no mention of restrictions (factors 3 and 4) or third-party involvement (factors 5 and 6), these conditions meet the criteria for a set-off as described in the article, meaning the defendant can be relieved from their obligation through set-off, yielding a verdict of Y.

(6 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 6 is present, which deals with a third party's knowledge or gross negligence regarding the manifestation of an intention to prohibit or restrict a set-off. Without any context about the obligations themselves (factors 1 and 2), the nature of these obligations (factor 3), or even if there was a manifested intention (factor 4), we cannot conclusively determine the defendant's obligation based solely on a third party's knowledge or lack thereof, leading to a verdict of N due to insufficient information.

 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person, that has given guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation.
2. A person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor.

6. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement.
7. The guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation.

Verdict: A person that has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched, and if the principal obligor asserts to have grounds for set-off, the guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 462, I will generate seven unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the given factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, factor 1 is present: "The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person, that has given guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation." Since the defendant performed an act for extinguishment of obligation as a guarantor without the principal obligor's request, they are legally obligated to fulfill their responsibilities under Article 459-2, paragraph (1).

2. (2 | N)
Here, only factor 2 is present: "A person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor." Becoming a guarantor against the principal obligor's will alone does not inherently imply an obligation without further context or actions taken by the guarantor. Therefore, in this scenario, the defendant is not obligated.

3. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, factors 1 and 2 are present: The defendant gave a guarantee without the principal obligor's request and performed an act for extinguishment of obligation. Given these circumstances, the defendant's actions as a guarantor without the principal obligor's consent, combined with their performance of an act for extinguishing the obligation, indicate that they have taken on a legal obligation.

4. (3 | Y)
This scenario involves factor 3: "The guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched." If the defendant is seeking reimbursement as a guarantor and this right exists, it implies they have previously fulfilled an obligation or made payments on behalf of another. Thus, acknowledging their right to reimbursement suggests an initial acceptance of obligation, making them legally obligated in this context.

5. (2, 4 | Y)
Factors 2 and 4 are present: The defendant became a guarantor against the principal obligor's will, and the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off against the obligee before the demand for reimbursement. Given that the principal obligor has potential counterclaims, this introduces complexity to the defendant's obligation as a guarantor. However, acknowledging these grounds implies an ongoing obligation to navigate these financial relationships, thus the defendant is obligated.

6. (5 | N)
Here, only factor 5 is considered: "The guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off." This factor alone describes a potential action of the guarantor rather than establishing an obligation. Without context indicating prior acceptance or performance of obligations, this scenario does not inherently imply the defendant's legal obligation.

7. (1, 6, 7 | Y)
In this final case, factors 1, 6, and 7 are present: The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis; the provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply to the exercise of the right to reimbursement; and the guarantor performs an act for extinguishment before the due date. Given these comprehensive conditions, including specific legal frameworks and proactive steps by the guarantor, it is clear that the defendant has not only accepted but also acted upon their obligations. Therefore, they are legally obligated under these circumstances.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 9 unique case scenarios. Here they are:


(1 | Y)
Justification: The principal obligation under a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual is crystallized in certain cases, which implies that the defendant is legally obligated when such cases occur.


(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: If the procedure for compulsory execution or enforcement procedure of a security right must be commenced and an obligee files a petition for compulsory execution or enforcement of any security right for a claim for payment of money with regard to any property of the guarantor, then the defendant is obligated.


(4 | Y)
Justification: The guarantor receiving an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding is a clear case where the principal obligation is crystallized, and thus the defendant is obligated.


(5 | Y)
Justification: The death of the relevant principal obligor or guarantor is another specified case where the principal obligation is crystallized, resulting in the defendant being obligated.


(6, 8 | Y)
Justification: Beyond the cases prescribed in the preceding paragraph, if an obligee files a petition for compulsory execution or enforcement of a security right for a claim for payment of money with regard to property of the principal obligor, then the defendant is obligated under the contract for revolving guarantee by an individual for loans.


(7 | N)
Justification: The factor only mentions that the procedure for compulsory execution or enforcement procedure of a security right must be commenced for crystallization in a specific case, but it does not provide enough information to determine obligation on its own.


(1, 9 | Y)
Justification: If the principal obligation under a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual is crystallized in certain cases and the principal obligor receives an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding, then the defendant is clearly obligated.


(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: The combination of the procedure for compulsory execution or enforcement procedure of a security right being commenced and the guarantor receiving an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding indicates that the defendant is obligated under the contract.


(3, 5, 6 | Y)
Justification: When an obligee files a petition for compulsory execution or enforcement of any security right, the relevant principal obligor or guarantor has died, and the case falls under the category of loans beyond the preceding paragraph, then the defendant is obligated due to the comprehensive nature of these factors covering various scenarios.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1: Determine True or False
Given the article and the query "The principal for the principal obligation under a contract for revolving guarantee on loans shall not be determined even if the relevant principal obligor has died," we must analyze whether this statement aligns with Article 465-4. According to paragraph (1) of the article, one of the cases where the principal of the principal obligation is crystallized is when "the relevant principal obligor or guarantor has died." Therefore, the query's assertion that the principal shall not be determined even if the principal obligor has died contradicts the article directly. Hence, based on logical reasoning and the content of Article 465-4, the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess Query Against Factors
1. The principal obligation under a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual is crystallized in certain cases.
   - (query does not entail 1) because it specifically addresses a scenario related to death, which is only one of several conditions.

2. The procedure for compulsory execution or enforcement procedure of a security right must be commenced for crystallization in the case of an obligee filing a petition for compulsory execution or enforcement of any security right.
   - (query does not entail 2) as it does not mention anything about procedures for compulsory execution or enforcement.

3. An obligee files a petition for compulsory execution or enforcement of any security right for a claim for payment of money with regard to any property of the guarantor.
   - (query does not entail 3) since it discusses the death of the principal obligor, not actions by an obligee against a guarantor.

4. The guarantor receives an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding.
   - (query does not entail 4) as it talks about the death of the principal obligor, not bankruptcy proceedings against the guarantor.

5. The relevant principal obligor or guarantor has died.
   - (query entails 5) because it directly addresses the scenario where the principal obligor has died.

6. Beyond the cases prescribed in the preceding paragraph, the principal obligation under a contract for revolving guarantee by an individual for loans is crystallized in certain cases.
   - (query does not entail 6) since it doesn't discuss additional conditions beyond those mentioned.

7. The procedure for compulsory execution or enforcement procedure of a security right must be commenced for crystallization in the case of an obligee filing a petition for compulsory execution or enforcement of a security right for a claim for payment of money with regard to property of the principal obligor.
   - (query does not entail 7) because it doesn't address procedures against the principal obligor's property.

8. An obligee files a petition for compulsory execution or enforcement of a security right for a claim for payment of money with regard to property of the principal obligor.
   - (query does not entail 8) as it focuses on the death of the principal obligor, not actions by an obligee against the principal obligor's property.

9. The principal obligor receives an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding.
   - (query does not entail 9) since it discusses death, not bankruptcy proceedings against the principal obligor.

The justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is False according to Article 465-4, especially considering factor 5.

### Task 3: Determine Obligation
Given the query and the analysis, the defendant's obligation under the contract for revolving guarantee by an individual for loans can indeed be determined upon the death of the principal obligor, as per Article 465-4(1)(iii). Therefore, the output should reflect that the query does determine the defendant obligated in this specific context. Hence:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 111, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list:

* The authority to represent ceases to exist upon the death of the principal.
* The authority to represent ceases to exist upon the death of the agent.
* The authority to represent ceases to exist when an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding is given against the agent.
* The authority to represent ceases to exist when a decision for commencement of guardianship is made against the agent.
* The authority to represent by mandate ceases to exist upon the termination of the mandate, excluding cases where it ceases due to the grounds set forth in the preceding paragraph.

Verdict: The authority to represent ceases to exist under the specified conditions.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 111, I will generate five unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will involve a subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, the death of the principal (factor 1) has occurred. According to Article 111(1)(i), the authority to represent ceases to exist upon the death of the principal. Therefore, the defendant is no longer authorized to represent and is thus obligated to cease representation. Verdict: Y

2. (2 | Y)
Here, the death of the agent (factor 2) has occurred. Article 111(1)(ii) states that the authority to represent ceases to exist upon the death of the agent. As a result, the defendant's authority to represent is terminated, and they are obligated to acknowledge this cessation. Verdict: Y

3. (3 | Y)
In this scenario, an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding has been given against the agent (factor 3). According to Article 111(1)(ii), this event causes the authority to represent to cease to exist. Consequently, the defendant is obligated to recognize the termination of their representation authority. Verdict: Y

4. (4 | Y)
This case involves a decision for commencement of guardianship made against the agent (factor 4). As stated in Article 111(1)(ii), such a decision results in the cessation of the authority to represent. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to accept that their representation authority has been terminated. Verdict: Y

5. (5 | Y)
In this final scenario, the termination of the mandate (factor 5) has occurred, excluding cases where it ceases due to the grounds set forth in the preceding paragraph. Article 111(2) specifies that the authority to represent by mandate ceases to exist upon the termination of the mandate. Hence, the defendant is obligated to acknowledge the end of their representation authority under the mandate. Verdict: Y

Note that each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors and yields a clear verdict regarding the defendant's obligations based on Article 111.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "The authority of an agency shall be terminated upon ruling for commencement of curatorship against the agent." According to Article 111, the authority to represent indeed ceases to exist when a decision for commencement of guardianship (which can be understood to include curatorship in this context) is made against the agent. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 111, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The authority to represent ceases to exist upon the death of the principal.**
   - The query does not mention the death of the principal; it specifically talks about the ruling for commencement of curatorship against the agent. Therefore, (query entails 1) is **False**.

2. **The authority to represent ceases to exist upon the death of the agent.**
   - Similar to factor 1, the query does not address the death of the agent but rather focuses on the ruling for curatorship. Hence, (query entails 2) is **False**.

3. **The authority to represent ceases to exist when an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding is given against the agent.**
   - The query is about curatorship, not bankruptcy proceedings. Thus, (query entails 3) is **False**.

4. **The authority to represent ceases to exist when a decision for commencement of guardianship is made against the agent.**
   - This factor aligns with the query, as "curatorship" can be considered under the broader term of "guardianship" in this context. Therefore, (query entails 4) is **True**.

5. **The authority to represent by mandate ceases to exist upon the termination of the mandate, excluding cases where it ceases due to the grounds set forth in the preceding paragraph.**
   - The query does not discuss the termination of a mandate but rather focuses on the effect of a curatorship ruling. Hence, (query entails 5) is **False**.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is True in the context of Article 111 regarding the specific condition of curatorship.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context, if the authority of an agency is terminated upon a ruling for commencement of curatorship against the agent, it implies certain obligations or consequences for the agent or the representation. However, the query itself does not explicitly state that the defendant is obligated to any specific action but rather states a condition under which the authority to represent ceases. Therefore, in terms of directly implying an obligation on the defendant to perform a particular action based solely on the information given, **pledged(0)** seems most appropriate, as the query primarily addresses a condition rather than imposing a direct obligation on the defendant.

 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the articles. Here is the list of factors:

2. The tender of the performance must be made actually consistent with the main purport of the obligation.
3. If the obligee refuses to accept that performance in advance, a different standard for tendering performance applies.
4. An act is required on the part of the obligee with respect to the performance of the obligation in certain cases.
5. In cases where an act is required from the obligee or if the obligee refuses to accept performance in advance, it is sufficient for the obligor to request acceptance by giving notice that the tender of the performance has been prepared.

Verdict: Upon tendering the performance, the obligor is relieved from any and all responsibilities which may arise from the non-performance of the obligation.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 492 and Article 493, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, the obligor has tendered the performance, relieving them from any responsibilities arising from non-performance (Factor 1). Since the obligor has fulfilled their obligation by tendering the performance, they are no longer legally obligated. However, according to Factor 1, upon tendering the performance, the obligor is relieved from any and all responsibilities which may arise from the non-performance of the obligation, thus the defendant is not obligated in the sense of being responsible for non-performance but has fulfilled their part of the contract. This indicates that the focus here should be on whether the act of tendering relieves the obligor of further obligations under these specific circumstances, suggesting a misunderstanding in applying Factor 1 directly to determine ongoing obligation without considering it as an action fulfilling the obligation.

2. (2 | N)
Here, the tender of the performance is made actually consistent with the main purport of the obligation (Factor 2). However, simply making the tender consistent with the obligation does not necessarily mean the obligor has fulfilled all obligations or that the defendant is obligated further without considering acceptance or other factors. This factor alone doesn't determine the legal obligation without context on acceptance or refusal by the obligee.

3. (1, 2 | Y)
In this scenario, both Factor 1 and Factor 2 are present: the obligor has tendered the performance, relieving them from responsibilities arising from non-performance, and the tender is consistent with the main purport of the obligation. Given that the obligor has made a valid tender (consistent with the obligation), they have fulfilled their part of the contract, thus the defendant can be seen as having met their obligations under these specific circumstances.

4. (3, 4 | N)
This case involves Factor 3 and Factor 4: the obligee refuses to accept the performance in advance, and an act is required on the part of the obligee with respect to the performance of the obligation. Despite the obligor's readiness to perform, the refusal by the obligee and the necessity for the obligee's action could complicate the determination of legal obligation. The defendant cannot be obligated further if the obligee's actions are necessary for the fulfillment of the contract and they refuse or do not act.

5. (1, 3, 4, 5 | Y)
In this comprehensive scenario, all factors from 1 to 5 are considered: the obligor is relieved upon tendering, the tender must be consistent with the obligation, there's a refusal by the obligee to accept in advance, an act is required by the obligee, and it's sufficient for the obligor to give notice of preparedness under certain conditions. Given that the obligor has taken all necessary steps (including giving notice as per Factor 5), despite the complicating factors of refusal and required action by the obligee, the defendant can be seen as having fulfilled their obligations under the contract, especially since they've followed the procedure outlined for such scenarios.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors to determine legal obligation based on the articles provided.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 145, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* The court may not make a judicial decision relying on prescription unless a party invokes it, which implies that **a party's invocation of prescription is required**.
* In the case of extinctive prescription, **the following parties may invoke prescription**: 
  - A guarantor
  - A third-party collateral provider
  - A third-party acquirer
  - Any other person with a legitimate interest in the extinction of a right.
* The court's decision relies on **prescription being invoked by a party or relevant third party**.
* Prescription must be **invoked by a party** (including guarantors, third-party collateral providers, third-party acquirers, or any other person with a legitimate interest) for the court to consider it in making a judicial decision.

Verdict: The court may not make a judicial decision relying on prescription unless a party invokes it.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors described in Article 145, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | N)
In this case, only factor 1 is present, which states that a party's invocation of prescription is required. However, since no party has invoked prescription, the court may not make a judicial decision relying on prescription, and therefore the defendant is not obligated.

(2 | Y)
In this case, factor 2 is present, which allows a guarantor to invoke prescription. Since the guarantor has invoked prescription, the court may consider it in making a judicial decision, and the defendant is obligated.

(3 | N)
In this case, only factor 3 is present, which states that the court's decision relies on prescription being invoked by a party or relevant third party. However, since no party or relevant third party has invoked prescription, the defendant is not obligated.

(4 | Y)
In this case, factor 4 is present, which requires prescription to be invoked by a party for the court to consider it. Since a party (including guarantors, third-party collateral providers, third-party acquirers, or any other person with a legitimate interest) has invoked prescription, the defendant is obligated.

(1, 2 | Y)
In this case, factors 1 and 2 are present. A party's invocation of prescription is required (factor 1), and a guarantor has invoked prescription (factor 2). Since the guarantor is a type of party that can invoke prescription, and prescription has been invoked, the defendant is obligated.

Note: I have ensured that no two cases use the same combination of factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given Article 145 and its breakdown, the key point is that a party (including specific third parties with legitimate interests) must invoke prescription for the court to consider it. The query mentions "the one who acquired Land X after the mortgage had been created on Land X and the creation had been registered may invoke the extinctive prescription of the secured claim under the mortgage." This scenario fits within the article's description, as an acquirer (in this context) could be considered a party with a legitimate interest in the extinction of a right, specifically regarding the mortgage on Land X. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the provided factors, the query seems to align with the conditions under which prescription can be invoked according to Article 145.

**Result: True**

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A party's invocation of prescription is required**: The query directly mentions that "the one who acquired Land X... may invoke the extinctive prescription," which aligns with this requirement.
   - (query entails a party's invocation of prescription is required)

2. **The following parties may invoke prescription: A guarantor, a third-party collateral provider, a third-party acquirer, or any other person with a legitimate interest in the extinction of a right**: The query specifically mentions "the one who acquired Land X," which falls under the category of "a third-party acquirer" or at least implies someone with a legitimate interest in the property's status regarding the mortgage.
   - (query entails the following parties may invoke prescription: A guarantor, a third-party collateral provider, a third-party acquirer, or any other person with a legitimate interest in the extinction of a right)

3. **The court's decision relies on prescription being invoked by a party or relevant third party**: The query implies that the acquirer's invocation of extinctive prescription is relevant to the secured claim under the mortgage.
   - (query entails the court's decision relies on prescription being invoked by a party or relevant third party)

4. **Prescription must be invoked by a party for the court to consider it in making a judicial decision**: The query states that the acquirer "may invoke the extinctive prescription," which is a condition for the court to consider prescription according to Article 145.
   - (query entails prescription must be invoked by a party)

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, indicating that the query's scenario fits within the conditions outlined in Article 145.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query focuses on who may invoke extinctive prescription rather than directly stating an obligation of a defendant. It discusses the potential action of "the one who acquired Land X" without specifying any obligations towards another party (e.g., a defendant) in terms of fulfilling or being bound by a particular duty.

**Result: pledged(0)**

In summary:

- The query is **True** based on logical reasoning and alignment with Article 145.
- The query entails all the listed factors related to the invocation of prescription.
- The query does not directly determine a defendant's obligations, thus **pledged(0)**.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Let's break down Article 9 into its constituent factors:

1. A juridical act is performed by an adult ward.
2. The adult ward is the performer of the juridical act.
3. The juridical act involves a purchase or other action.
4. The purchase or action may be for daily necessities.
5. The purchase or action may be involved in day-to-day life.
6. There are exceptions to the general rule regarding the validity of the juridical act.

Verdict: A juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable; provided, however, that this does not apply to the purchase of daily necessities or to any other act involved in day-to-day life.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given factors from Article 9, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | N)
In this case, only factors 1 and 2 are present: a juridical act is performed by an adult ward, and the adult ward is the performer of the juridical act. However, without more information about the nature of the act (e.g., whether it involves daily necessities or day-to-day life), we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated. The general rule makes the act voidable, but without specifics, we lean towards the defendant not being obligated due to the lack of detail on exceptions.

2. (3, 4 | Y)
Here, factors 3 and 4 are present: the juridical act involves a purchase or other action, and the purchase or action may be for daily necessities. Given that the purchase is for daily necessities, which is an exception to the general rule, the defendant can be considered legally obligated because this specific type of transaction is not voidable according to Article 9.

3. (5 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 5 is present: the purchase or action may be involved in day-to-day life. While being involved in day-to-day life is an exception that makes a juridical act not voidable, the presence of this factor alone without specifying it's actually a part of daily necessities or another clear exception does not automatically obligate the defendant. The act could still fall under general voidability without more context.

4. (1, 6 | N)
This case involves factors 1 and 6: a juridical act is performed by an adult ward, and there are exceptions to the general rule regarding the validity of the juridical act. Knowing there are exceptions but not which specific exception applies means we cannot assume the defendant is obligated without further details. The general rule would suggest voidability, leaning towards the defendant not being obligated.

5. (2, 3 | N)
Factors 2 and 3 are present: the adult ward is the performer of the juridical act, and the juridical act involves a purchase or other action. Without information on whether this act falls under an exception (like daily necessities or day-to-day life), we default to the general rule that such acts by adult wards are voidable, suggesting the defendant is not obligated.

6. (4, 5, 6 | Y)
In this final scenario, factors 4, 5, and 6 are present: the purchase or action may be for daily necessities, the purchase or action may be involved in day-to-day life, and there are exceptions to the general rule regarding the validity of the juridical act. Given that both daily necessities and day-to-day life activities are explicitly mentioned as exceptions to the voidability rule, and acknowledging there are exceptions, it's clear that this scenario falls under one of those exceptions. Therefore, the defendant can be considered legally obligated because their actions align with exceptions that make a juridical act not voidable.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Assessing the Query's Validity Based on Logical Reasoning

The article states that a juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable unless it involves the purchase of daily necessities or acts involved in day-to-day life. The query posits that the purchase of daily household items may not be rescinded, even if an adult ward performed the act.

Given the information from Article 9 and understanding that "daily household items" can be considered under "daily necessities" or activities involved in "day-to-day life," it logically follows that such purchases would indeed be exceptions to the general rule of being voidable. Therefore, based on this reasoning, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Evaluating Factor Expression in the Query

1. **A juridical act is performed by an adult ward.**
   - The query implies this scenario but focuses on a specific type of act (purchase of daily household items), so it indirectly considers this factor.
   - (query entails 1)

2. **The adult ward is the performer of the juridical act.**
   - This is directly implied in the query as it mentions "an adult ward performed the act."
   - (query entails 2)

3. **The juridical act involves a purchase or other action.**
   - The query specifically talks about "the purchase of daily household items," aligning with this factor.
   - (query entails 3)

4. **The purchase or action may be for daily necessities.**
   - By mentioning "daily household items," the query falls under the category of daily necessities, thus considering this factor.
   - (query entails 4)

5. **The purchase or action may be involved in day-to-day life.**
   - Similar to factor 4, "daily household items" are part of day-to-day life, so this factor is considered.
   - (query entails 5)

6. **There are exceptions to the general rule regarding the validity of the juridical act.**
   - The query itself represents an exception (purchases of daily household items not being rescinded), thus acknowledging this factor.
   - (query entails 6)

These justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is true based on the given article and factors.

### Task 3: Determining Obligation

The query does not explicitly discuss any obligations of a defendant in a legal sense but rather states a principle related to juridical acts by adult wards. However, interpreting "obligated" in the context of whether the query determines that someone (like an adult ward or another party) is bound by certain responsibilities or outcomes due to such acts, it seems there's no direct implication of obligation being placed on a defendant as typically understood in legal proceedings.

Therefore, based on this interpretation and the specific format requested:
- pledged(0)

This indicates that the query does not directly determine any obligations of a defendant.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 389, I have broken down the text into key factors and phrases to determine the verdict in cases applying this article:

1. A building is constructed on mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage.
2. The mortgagee has the right to auction the building together with the land.
3. The right of priority of the mortgagee may be exercised solely against the proceeds of the land.
4. The owner of the building has rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land.
5. These rights may be duly asserted against the mortgagee.

Verdict: If a building is constructed on a mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage, the mortgagee may auction the building together with the land; provided, however, that the right of priority of that mortgagee may be exercised solely against the proceeds of the land.
Verdict: The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the owner of that building has rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land that may be duly asserted against the mortgagee.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios, each using a unique combination of factors.


## Case 1:
(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, a building is constructed on mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage (factor 1), and the mortgagee has the right to auction the building together with the land (factor 2). Given these conditions, the defendant (mortgagee) is legally obligated to proceed with the auction as per their rights.


## Case 2:
(3 | N)
Justification: This case involves only the factor that the right of priority of the mortgagee may be exercised solely against the proceeds of the land (factor 3). Since this condition limits the mortgagee's right of priority but does not inherently obligate them without the context of auctioning the building or land, the defendant is not obligated.


## Case 3:
(1, 4 | N)
Justification: Here, a building is constructed on mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage (factor 1), and the owner of the building has rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land (factor 4). Given that the owner's rights can be asserted against the mortgagee, this scenario suggests an exception to the mortgagee's ability to auction the property without considering these rights, thus the defendant is not obligated.


## Case 4:
(2, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the mortgagee has the right to auction the building together with the land (factor 2), and the owner of the building has rights that may be duly asserted against the mortgagee (factor 5). Despite the owner's assertable rights, the primary factor here is the mortgagee's right to auction. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to proceed with the auction while considering the owner's rights.


## Case 5:
(1, 3, 4 | N)
Justification: This scenario combines factors where a building is constructed on mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage (factor 1), the right of priority of the mortgagee may be exercised solely against the proceeds of the land (factor 3), and the owner of the building has rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land (factor 4). Given that the owner's rights can be asserted against the mortgagee and considering the limitation on the mortgagee's right of priority, these conditions collectively suggest an exception to the general rule, indicating the defendant is not obligated.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that if a building existed on a mortgaged land at the time it was mortgaged, even if the owner of that building did not have the right to possess the land which may be asserted against the mortgagee, the mortgagee may not auction the building together with the land. 

However, Article 389 specifically mentions that its provisions apply when a building is constructed on mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage. It does not explicitly address situations where the building existed before the mortgage was created. Therefore, based on the information provided in Article 389, we cannot directly infer the query's truth value from the article because it deals with a scenario (building existing before mortgage creation) not explicitly covered by the article.

But logically, if the article does not provide for the auction of buildings constructed after the mortgage was created under certain conditions, and it specifically addresses post-mortgage construction scenarios, then it suggests that pre-existing structures might be treated differently. The query implies a scenario not directly addressed by Article 389, suggesting that the mortgagee's rights over pre-existing buildings could differ from those over buildings constructed after mortgaging.

Given this analysis, without explicit mention of how pre-existing buildings are handled, we cannot definitively label the query as True or False based solely on Article 389. However, the query seems to imply a logical extension that if a building was already there, perhaps different rules apply, which could potentially be true given the article's silence on this matter.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **A building is constructed on mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage.**
   - (query does not entail 1) because it discusses buildings existing before the mortgage was created, not after.

2. **The mortgagee has the right to auction the building together with the land.**
   - (query entails 2) in the sense that it considers the scenario where this right might or might not apply, specifically questioning its applicability to pre-existing buildings.

3. **The right of priority of the mortgagee may be exercised solely against the proceeds of the land.**
   - (query does not entail 3) as it doesn't address how the mortgagee's rights are prioritized in relation to the land's proceeds for pre-existing buildings.

4. **The owner of the building has rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land.**
   - (query entails 4) because it specifically mentions a scenario where the owner does not have such rights that can be asserted against the mortgagee.

5. **These rights may be duly asserted against the mortgagee.**
   - (query entails 5) in the context of discussing what happens when these rights do or do not exist for pre-existing buildings, though it focuses on a scenario where they cannot be asserted.

Justifications align with the understanding that Article 389 does not directly address the query's specific scenario, implying that the query touches on aspects related to but not explicitly covered by the article.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the context and analysis, it seems that the query raises questions about the rights of mortgagees over buildings that existed before the land was mortgaged. The query itself does not directly imply an obligation on a defendant but rather seeks clarification or establishes a hypothetical scenario regarding mortgagee rights.

Thus, **pledged(0)** because the query is inquiring about legal principles and scenarios rather than directly stating or implying obligations on a party.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on the provided civil legal article context, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article.

Factors:
1. The loan is for use.
2. The period of loan has expired.
3. The borrower's death occurs.

Verdict: A loan for use is terminated upon the death of the borrower.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate three legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | N)
Justification: The loan is for use, but there is no information about the expiration of the period of loan or the borrower's death. According to Article 597, the loan for use is terminated upon the death of the borrower or the expiration of the period of loan. Since neither of these conditions has occurred, the defendant is not obligated.

(2 | N)
Justification: The period of loan has expired, but there is no information about the type of loan or the borrower's death. Article 597 specifically mentions a "loan for use," and the expiration of the period of loan alone does not necessarily imply termination. Therefore, without knowing the type of loan, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(3 | Y)
Justification: The borrower's death has occurred. According to Article 597, a loan for use is terminated upon the death of the borrower. This condition is sufficient to determine that the defendant is obligated, as the loan is indeed terminated.

Note that I have not included a case with factors (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (2, 3) as these combinations would not provide a clear and determinate verdict based on the provided article. The article only explicitly mentions termination upon the death of the borrower or the expiration of the period of loan for a "loan for use."

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on the provided article, I have broken down the text into key factors and identified the verdict as follows:

Factors:
1. A juridical act is subject to an unlawful condition.
2. The condition involves an unlawful act.
3. A juridical act is subject to the condition that an unlawful act not be performed.

Verdict: A juridical act subject to an unlawful condition, or the condition that an unlawful act not be performed, is void.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate three legal case scenarios, each using a unique combination of factors.


Case 1: (1 | Y)
In this scenario, a juridical act is subject to an unlawful condition (Factor 1). According to Article 132, a juridical act subject to an unlawful condition is void. However, the unlawfulness of the condition does not necessarily absolve the defendant of all obligations, as the act itself may still be considered binding in certain aspects or contexts until it is formally declared void. Given this complexity and the need for precise legal interpretation, the defendant could still be seen as obligated under specific circumstances or until a court declares the act entirely void.


Case 2: (2 | N)
Here, the condition involves an unlawful act (Factor 2), but there's no explicit mention that the juridical act itself is subject to this condition. Since Article 132 specifically addresses juridical acts subject to unlawful conditions or the condition that an unlawful act not be performed, a scenario where only the condition involves an unlawful act without directly applying to a juridical act might not trigger the voidness as described. Therefore, the defendant might not be obligated due to the lack of direct application of Factor 2 to the juridical act's validity.


Case 3: (1, 3 | Y)
In this case, both factors are present: a juridical act is subject to an unlawful condition (Factor 1), and it is also subject to the condition that an unlawful act not be performed (Factor 3). Article 132 clearly states that in either scenario, the juridical act is void. The presence of both factors reinforces the unlawfulness of the conditions surrounding the juridical act, making it unequivocally void. Therefore, any obligations derived from such an act would be nullified, but the process of determining and declaring the act void could involve legal proceedings where the defendant's obligations are assessed in the context of this voidness.


Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligations based on Article 132.

6. The request for curatorship can be made by the person in question, the person's spouse, the person's relative within the fourth degree of kinship, the guardian, the guardian's supervisor, the assistant, the assistant's supervisor, or a public prosecutor.
7. The existence of a cause set forth in Article 7 is a condition that excludes a person from being subject to curatorship.

Verdict: The family court may decide to commence an assistance or curatorship in respect of a person based on the factors listed above.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder. Since factor 1 is present, the defendant is obligated to receive assistance.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The request for assistance can be made by the person in question or their relatives, and the person's capacity to appreciate their own situation must be inadequate due to a mental disorder. With both factors 2 and 3 present, the defendant is obligated to receive assistance.

(4 | N)
Justification: The request for assistance is subject to the condition that there are no grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11. Since only factor 4 is present, indicating that there might be grounds for exclusion, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: The family court may decide to commence an assistance or curatorship in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate or extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder. With both factors 1 and 5 present, the defendant is obligated to receive either assistance or curatorship.

(2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The request for assistance or curatorship can be made by the person in question, their relatives, or other authorized individuals. Since both factors 2 and 6 are present, covering requests for both assistance and curatorship, the defendant is obligated to receive either form of support.

(3, 7 | N)
Justification: The person's capacity to appreciate their own situation must be inadequate due to a mental disorder, but the existence of a cause set forth in Article 7 excludes them from being subject to curatorship. With factors 3 and 7 present, indicating both a mental disorder and an exclusionary condition, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 2, 4 | Y)
Justification: The family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder, and the request can be made by authorized individuals, provided there are no exclusionary grounds. Since factors 1, 2, and 4 are present, covering the decision to assist, the request, and the absence of exclusionary grounds, the defendant is obligated to receive assistance.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 608, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* The lessee has defrayed necessary expenses with respect to the leased thing.
* The necessary expenses ought to be borne by the lessor.
* The lessee may immediately demand reimbursement of necessary expenses from the lessor.
* The lessee has incurred beneficial expenses with respect to the leased thing.
* The lessor must reimburse beneficial expenses on termination of the lease.
* The reimbursement of beneficial expenses is subject to compliance with the provisions of Article 196, paragraph (2).
* The court may grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement of beneficial expenses at the lessor's request.

Verdict: If the lessee has defrayed necessary expenses, the lessee may immediately demand reimbursement from the lessor, and if the lessee has incurred beneficial expenses, the lessor must reimburse those expenses on termination of the lease or within a reasonable period granted by the court.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the factors of Article 608, we'll create combinations of these factors to determine the legal obligation of the defendant in each scenario. The factors are numbered as follows for reference:

1. The lessee has defrayed necessary expenses with respect to the leased thing.
2. The necessary expenses ought to be borne by the lessor.
3. The lessee may immediately demand reimbursement of necessary expenses from the lessor.
4. The lessee has incurred beneficial expenses with respect to the leased thing.
5. The lessor must reimburse beneficial expenses on termination of the lease.
6. The reimbursement of beneficial expenses is subject to compliance with the provisions of Article 196, paragraph (2).
7. The court may grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement of beneficial expenses at the lessor's request.

Given these factors, we will create seven unique case scenarios, each with a different combination of factors that leads to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation.

### Case 1: Immediate Reimbursement for Necessary Expenses
(1, 2, 3 | Y)
- **Justification**: The lessee has defrayed necessary expenses (Factor 1) that ought to be borne by the lessor (Factor 2), and thus the lessee may immediately demand reimbursement (Factor 3). This combination directly implies the lessor's obligation to reimburse.

### Case 2: Beneficial Expenses Reimbursement
(4, 5 | Y)
- **Justification**: The lessee has incurred beneficial expenses (Factor 4), and the lessor must reimburse these expenses on termination of the lease (Factor 5). This scenario clearly obligates the lessor to reimburse.

### Case 3: Necessary Expenses Without Immediate Demand
(1, 2 | N)
- **Justification**: Although the lessee has defrayed necessary expenses (Factor 1) that ought to be borne by the lessor (Factor 2), without the factor of immediate demand for reimbursement (Factor 3), we cannot conclusively determine the lessor's obligation based solely on these factors.

### Case 4: Compliance with Article 196 for Beneficial Expenses
(4, 6 | Y)
- **Justification**: The lessee has incurred beneficial expenses (Factor 4), and the reimbursement of these expenses is subject to compliance with Article 196, paragraph (2) (Factor 6). This implies a legal framework for reimbursement, suggesting the lessor's obligation.

### Case 5: Court Intervention for Beneficial Expenses
(4, 7 | Y)
- **Justification**: The lessee has incurred beneficial expenses (Factor 4), and the court may grant a reasonable period for their reimbursement at the lessor's request (Factor 7). This indicates potential for legal enforcement of reimbursement, obligating the lessor.

### Case 6: Necessary Expenses with Compliance Consideration
(1, 2, 6 | Y)
- **Justification**: The lessee has defrayed necessary expenses (Factor 1) that ought to be borne by the lessor (Factor 2), and while the reimbursement of beneficial expenses is subject to compliance with Article 196, paragraph (2) (Factor 6), this suggests a framework where necessary expenses could also be considered for reimbursement under legal compliance, thus obligating the lessor.

### Case 7: All Factors Considered
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 | Y)
- **Justification**: This scenario includes all factors, indicating a comprehensive situation where both necessary and beneficial expenses are considered, with clear pathways for reimbursement (immediate demand for necessary expenses and compliance with legal provisions for beneficial expenses). The lessor is undoubtedly obligated to reimburse in this scenario.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation based on Article 608.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1: Determining the Truth of the Query
Based on Article 608, if a lessee has defrayed necessary expenses with respect to the leased thing that ought to be borne by the lessor, the lessee may immediately demand reimbursement from the lessor. The query suggests that the lessee can wait for the end of the lease and then demand reimbursement for necessary expenses made to preserve the condition of the leased thing for its ordinary use. According to Article 608(1), there is no requirement for the lessee to wait until the end of the lease to demand reimbursement for necessary expenses. Therefore, the query is **False** because it inaccurately represents the timing of when a lessee can demand reimbursement.

### Task 2: Assessing Factor Expression in the Query
Let's assess each factor:
1. **The lessee has defrayed necessary expenses with respect to the leased thing.**
   - (query entails 1) The query mentions that the lessee has defrayed necessary expenses, aligning with this factor.

2. **The necessary expenses ought to be borne by the lessor.**
   - (query entails 2) This is implied in the context of the query since it discusses reimbursement for preserving the condition appropriate for profit from ordinary use, suggesting these are necessary expenses that should be borne by the lessor.

3. **The lessee may immediately demand reimbursement of necessary expenses from the lessor.**
   - The query does not align with this factor because it suggests waiting until the end of the lease, contrary to what Article 608(1) states about immediate demand.

4. **The lessee has incurred beneficial expenses with respect to the leased thing.**
   - This factor is not directly addressed in the query, which focuses on necessary expenses for preserving the condition of the leased thing.

5. **The lessor must reimburse beneficial expenses on termination of the lease.**
   - The query does not address beneficial expenses but rather necessary ones, so it does not align with this factor.

6. **The reimbursement of beneficial expenses is subject to compliance with the provisions of Article 196, paragraph (2).**
   - Since the query deals with necessary expenses and not beneficial ones, it does not express this factor.

7. **The court may grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement of beneficial expenses at the lessor's request.**
   - The query discusses waiting until the end of the lease for reimbursement but does so in the context of necessary expenses, not beneficial ones, and doesn't mention court intervention or the lessor's request.

### Task 3: Determining Defendant Obligation
Given that the query inaccurately represents when a lessee can demand reimbursement (immediately vs. waiting until the end of the lease), it does suggest that the defendant (lessor) has an obligation to reimburse expenses related to preserving the leased thing for its ordinary use, but it misrepresents the timing and possibly the nature (necessary vs. beneficial) of these expenses. Therefore, in terms of determining if the query acknowledges a defendant's obligation to pay:
- **pledged(1)**: The query implies that the lessor (defendant) is obligated to reimburse the lessee for necessary expenses related to preserving the leased thing, even though it incorrectly suggests waiting until the lease ends.

In summary:
- Query entails 1
- Query entails 2
- The query does not accurately reflect factors 3, 5, 6, or 7.
- **pledged(1)**: Indicates acknowledgment of the defendant's obligation to reimburse expenses.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 423, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* An obligee may exercise the right of the obligor (subrogor's right) when necessary to preserve the obligee's own claim.
* The subrogor's right does not apply to rights which belong exclusively to and are personal to the obligor.
* The subrogor's right does not apply to rights which are immune from attachment.
* The obligee's claim must become due before exercising the subrogor's right, except in cases of an act of preservation.
* An act of preservation is an exception to the rule that the obligee's claim must be due before exercising the subrogor's right.
* The obligee may not exercise the subrogor's right if the obligee's claim is not enforceable by compulsory execution.

Verdict: An obligee may exercise the subrogor's right under certain conditions, including when necessary to preserve their own claim and when their claim is due or an act of preservation is required, unless the claim is not enforceable by compulsory execution or the rights belong exclusively to the obligor or are immune from attachment.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 423, I will generate six legal case scenarios, each using a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only the first factor is present: "An obligee may exercise the right of the obligor (subrogor's right) when necessary to preserve the obligee's own claim." Since the obligee needs to preserve their claim, and there are no restrictions mentioned in this isolated factor, the defendant would be obligated to allow the obligee to exercise the subrogor's right.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: This case involves factors 2 and 3, which state that the subrogor's right does not apply to rights belonging exclusively to the obligor or rights immune from attachment. Given these restrictions without any mention of necessity for preservation or due claims, the defendant is not obligated because the subrogor's right cannot be exercised under these conditions.

(4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 4 is considered: "The obligee's claim must become due before exercising the subrogor's right, except in cases of an act of preservation." Since the claim becoming due is a condition that can be met (and assuming it has been met), and there are no other restrictions mentioned, the defendant would be obligated to recognize the obligee's right to exercise the subrogor's right.

(5 | Y)
Justification: Factor 5 states, "An act of preservation is an exception to the rule that the obligee's claim must be due before exercising the subrogor's right." Given this scenario where an act of preservation is necessary and no other factors are considered, the defendant would be obligated because the exception allows for the exercise of the subrogor's right regardless of the claim's due status.

(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: This case combines factors 1 and 4: The obligee needs to preserve their claim, and the claim must become due (or is due) before exercising the subrogor's right. Since both conditions can be satisfied (the need for preservation and the claim being due), the defendant would be obligated to allow the exercise of the subrogor's right.

(6 | N)
Justification: Factor 6 states, "The obligee may not exercise the subrogor's right if the obligee's claim is not enforceable by compulsory execution." In this scenario, since the only factor present indicates a prohibition based on the claim not being enforceable by compulsory execution, the defendant would not be obligated because the conditions for exercising the subrogor's right are not met.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation.

 After carefully reading Article 472-4, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. An obligee may transfer a security right that has been created as security for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released pursuant to the provisions of Article 472, paragraph (1).
2. The transfer of a security right is allowed to the obligation assumed by the replacing obligor.
3. If a person other than the replacing obligor created the security right, the obligee must obtain consent from that person.
4. The transfer of a security right must be effected by manifesting the intention to the replacing obligor in advance or upon the transfer.
5. The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) apply mutatis mutandis if there is a person that gave guarantee for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released pursuant to the provisions of Article 472, paragraph (1).

Verdict: The obligee may transfer a security right to the obligation assumed by the replacing obligor, provided that the necessary consents are obtained and the transfer is properly effected.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 472-4, I have generated seven unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of the given factors and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, an obligee may transfer a security right that has been created as security for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released (Factor 1), and the transfer of a security right is allowed to the obligation assumed by the replacing obligor (Factor 2). Given these factors, the defendant is legally obligated because the conditions for transferring the security right are met.

2. (3 | N)
In this scenario, if a person other than the replacing obligor created the security right, the obligee must obtain consent from that person (Factor 3). Without any additional factors indicating that consent was obtained or that the transfer was properly effected, it cannot be concluded that the defendant is obligated. Thus, the defendant is not legally obligated.

3. (1, 4 | Y)
Here, an obligee may transfer a security right that has been created as security for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released (Factor 1), and the transfer of a security right must be effected by manifesting the intention to the replacing obligor in advance or upon the transfer (Factor 4). Since both conditions necessary for the transfer are present, the defendant is legally obligated.

4. (2, 5 | Y)
In this case, the transfer of a security right is allowed to the obligation assumed by the replacing obligor (Factor 2), and the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) apply mutatis mutandis if there is a person that gave guarantee for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released (Factor 5). Given these factors, the conditions for transferring the security right to a new obligation are met even in the context of a guarantee, so the defendant is legally obligated.

5. (3, 6 | Y)
This scenario involves a situation where if a person other than the replacing obligor created the security right, the obligee must obtain consent from that person (Factor 3), and in cases where a person gave guarantee for the obligation, the consent referred to in paragraph (1) must be given in writing to be effective (Factor 6). Assuming written consent was provided, the necessary conditions are met for the defendant to be legally obligated.

6. (4, 7 | Y)
In this case, the transfer of a security right must be effected by manifesting the intention to the replacing obligor in advance or upon the transfer (Factor 4), and if the consent is given by means of an electronic or magnetic record in which its content is recorded, it is deemed to have been given in writing (Factor 7). Given that both the proper method of transfer and a valid form of consent are present, the defendant is legally obligated.

7. (1, 3, 5 | Y)
Here, an obligee may transfer a security right that has been created as security for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released (Factor 1), if a person other than the replacing obligor created the security right, the obligee must obtain consent from that person (Factor 3), and the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) apply mutatis mutandis if there is a person that gave guarantee for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released (Factor 5). Assuming consent was obtained and considering the applicability to guarantee scenarios, the defendant is legally obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 **Task 1:**
Based on logical reasoning and the provided Article 472-4, the query "In an assumption of obligation releasing old obligor, an obligee may not transfer a security right that has been created as security for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released, to the obligation assumed by the replacing obligor" is **False**. The article explicitly states that an obligee may transfer a security right under certain conditions, contradicting the query's statement.

**Task 2:**
Assessing whether the query expresses each factor:

1. An obligee may transfer a security right that has been created as security for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released pursuant to the provisions of Article 472, paragraph (1).
   - The query does not align with this factor because it states the opposite regarding the ability to transfer a security right.
   - **(query entails 1)**: False

2. The transfer of a security right is allowed to the obligation assumed by the replacing obligor.
   - This factor directly contradicts the query, which claims the transfer may not happen.
   - **(query entails 2)**: False

3. If a person other than the replacing obligor created the security right, the obligee must obtain consent from that person.
   - The query does not mention anything about obtaining consent, so it doesn't directly express this factor.
   - **(query entails 3)**: Not Applicable

4. The transfer of a security right must be effected by manifesting the intention to the replacing obligor in advance or upon the transfer.
   - Similar to factor 3, the query does not address how the transfer should be effected.
   - **(query entails 4)**: Not Applicable

5. The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) apply mutatis mutandis if there is a person that gave guarantee for the obligation from which the initial obligor is released pursuant to the provisions of Article 472, paragraph (1).
   - This factor is about applying certain rules when there's a guarantor involved, which the query does not address.
   - **(query entails 5)**: Not Applicable

6. In cases where a person gave guarantee for the obligation, the consent referred to in paragraph (1) must be given in writing to be effective.
   - The query doesn't discuss the method of giving consent or its effectiveness in cases involving guarantors.
   - **(query entails 6)**: Not Applicable

7. If the consent is given by means of an electronic or magnetic record in which its content is recorded, it is deemed to have been given in writing.
   - This factor is about the method of giving consent and does not relate directly to the query's claim about transferring security rights.
   - **(query entails 7)**: Not Applicable

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 that the query is False because it contradicts several key factors, especially those related to the ability to transfer a security right.

**Task 3:**
The query does not determine the defendant obligated directly since it discusses a scenario involving an obligee and the conditions under which a security right can be transferred. Therefore, it's more about the rights and procedures of the parties involved rather than directly imposing an obligation on a defendant.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 128, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences to determine the relevant factors:

1. A condition exists in a juridical act.
2. The fulfillment of the condition is uncertain.
3. A party to the juridical act is subject to the condition.
4. The other party has interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.
5. A party may not prejudice the other party's interests.

Verdict: A party to a juridical act that is subject to a condition may not prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 128, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors.

1. (1, 2 | N)
In this case, a condition exists in a juridical act (factor 1), and the fulfillment of the condition is uncertain (factor 2). However, since there is no mention of a party being subject to the condition or having interests that would arise from the juridical act, it cannot be determined that the defendant has prejudiced the other party's interests. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

2. (3, 4 | Y)
Here, a party to the juridical act is subject to the condition (factor 3), and the other party has interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition (factor 4). Given these factors, it can be inferred that the defendant has a responsibility to protect the other party's interests. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

3. (1, 5 | N)
In this scenario, a condition exists in a juridical act (factor 1), and a party may not prejudice the other party's interests (factor 5). Although the defendant should not prejudice the other party's interests, there is no indication that they have actually done so or that the condition affects them. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

4. (2, 3 | N)
In this case, the fulfillment of the condition is uncertain (factor 2), and a party to the juridical act is subject to the condition (factor 3). While the defendant may be subject to the condition, there is no information about the other party's interests or whether they have been prejudiced. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

5. (4, 5 | Y)
Here, the other party has interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition (factor 4), and a party may not prejudice the other party's interests (factor 5). Given these factors, it can be determined that the defendant has a responsibility to protect the other party's interests and avoid prejudicing them. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 591, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

1. The parties do not define the time for return of borrowed things.
2. The lender may demand their return, specifying a reasonable period of time.
3. The borrower may return the borrowed thing at any time.
4. The parties have defined the time of return of the thing, which is irrelevant to the borrower's ability to return the thing early.
5. The lender sustains any damage because the borrower returns the thing prior to the defined time of return.
6. The parties defined the time of return of the borrowed thing.

Verdict: If the conditions in factors 1-6 are met, then the following outcomes may occur:
- The lender may demand the return of borrowed things (factor 2).
- The borrower may claim compensation for damages sustained by the lender due to early return (factor 5, implied as a potential claim). 
- The lender may claim compensation from the borrower if damage is sustained due to early return (as stated in sentence 3 of Article 591).
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 591, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of the factors and determines whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The parties did not define the time for return of borrowed things (factor 1), and the lender may demand their return, specifying a reasonable period of time (factor 2). Since the lender has made a demand with a reasonable timeframe, the defendant (borrower) is obligated to return the borrowed items.

2. (3 | N)
Justification: The borrower may return the borrowed thing at any time (factor 3). This factor alone does not impose an obligation on the defendant; rather, it grants them flexibility in returning the item. Without any other factors implying a demand or agreement, the defendant is not obligated.

3. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The parties have defined the time of return of the thing, which is irrelevant to the borrower's ability to return the thing early (factor 4), and the lender sustains damage because the borrower returns the thing prior to the defined time of return (factor 5). Given that the early return causes damage, the defendant could be held liable for compensation, indicating an obligation.

4. (2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The lender may demand their return, specifying a reasonable period of time (factor 2), and the parties defined the time of return of the borrowed thing (factor 6). With both a specific demand from the lender and a predefined return time agreed upon by the parties, the defendant is obligated to comply with the return request.

5. (1, 3 | N)
Justification: The parties do not define the time for return of borrowed things (factor 1), and the borrower may return the borrowed thing at any time (factor 3). These factors together suggest flexibility in returning the item but do not inherently impose an obligation on the defendant without a demand from the lender or an agreement on the return time.

6. (5, 6 | Y)
Justification: The lender sustains any damage because the borrower returns the thing prior to the defined time of return (factor 5), and the parties defined the time of return of the borrowed thing (factor 6). Since the early return causes damage and there was an agreed-upon return time, the defendant is obligated to compensate the lender for the damages sustained due to their actions.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False
Based on Article 591, particularly section (2), it states that "The borrower may return the borrowed thing at any time, irrespective of whether the parties have defined the time of return of the thing." This implies that a borrower has the flexibility to return borrowed items without being bound by a predefined timeline. However, the article does not explicitly mention anything about terminating a money loan for consumption or the specifics regarding interest charges upon early return.

Given this context, the query's claim that "a borrower may terminate a money loan for consumption without charging any interest by returning the borrowed money at any time" aligns with the principle of returning borrowed things at any time but introduces specifics (termination of a money loan and not charging interest) not directly addressed in Article 591. Thus, based solely on Article 591, we cannot conclusively verify all aspects of the query as true or false without making some assumptions about the nature of "borrowed things" and the implications for financial loans.

However, considering general principles of contract law and assuming that "borrowed things" can include money and that returning borrowed money at any time might be seen as analogous to returning other borrowed items, one might argue the query leans towards being true in spirit but requires more specific legal context or clarification on interest charges to confirm its absolute truthfulness.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor
1. **The parties do not define the time for return of borrowed things**: The query implies this scenario by stating "if the parties do not define the time of return."
   - (query entails 1)
2. **The lender may demand their return, specifying a reasonable period of time**: This is not directly addressed in the query.
   - (query does not entail 2)
3. **The borrower may return the borrowed thing at any time**: The query aligns with this by stating the borrower can return the money at any time.
   - (query entails 3)
4. **The parties have defined the time of return of the thing, which is irrelevant to the borrower's ability to return the thing early**: The query actually posits a scenario where no such definition exists, making this factor not directly applicable.
   - (query does not entail 4)
5. **The lender sustains any damage because the borrower returns the thing prior to the defined time of return**: This is mentioned indirectly by discussing termination without charging interest, implying no damage or consideration for early return damages.
   - (query entails a scenario where factor 5 might be considered but does not directly address potential damages)
6. **The parties defined the time of return of the borrowed thing**: The query explicitly states a scenario where this is not done.
   - (query does not entail 6, as it specifies a lack of definition)

Justifications generally align with the nuanced interpretation from Task 1, indicating that while the query touches on some factors directly or indirectly, it introduces specifics not covered by Article 591.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated
The query discusses conditions under which a borrower may return borrowed money without incurring interest charges, implying flexibility rather than obligation. Thus, it does not clearly establish an obligation on the part of the defendant (borrower) in a manner that would necessitate representation as obligated.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

* A person is considered an "absentee" if they have taken leave of their domicile or residence.
* The absentee has not appointed an administrator for their property.
* The family court may order necessary dispositions with regard to the administration of the absentee's property at the request of an interested person or a public prosecutor.
* The administrator's authority is extinguished during the absence of the absentee, which triggers the family court's potential intervention.
* An interested person or a public prosecutor can request the family court to take action regarding the administration of the absentee's property.
* The absentee may appoint an administrator after an order has been issued by the family court.
* The authority of the newly appointed administrator can lead to the rescission of the previous order.

Verdict: The family court may order the necessary dispositions with regard to the administration of the absentee's property, and the court must rescind that order if the absentee appoints an administrator after the order has been issued.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the results:


(1 | Y)
Justification: The person is considered an "absentee" if they have taken leave of their domicile or residence. Since this factor alone does not explicitly state the obligation, we must consider the context of the article, which implies that being an absentee can lead to court intervention in property administration. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.


(2 | N)
Justification: The absentee has not appointed an administrator for their property. However, this factor alone does not necessarily trigger the family court's intervention or imply an obligation on the defendant.


(1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The person is considered an "absentee" and the family court may order necessary dispositions with regard to the administration of the absentee's property at the request of an interested person or a public prosecutor. This combination of factors indicates that the court has the authority to intervene, and therefore, the defendant is obligated.


(4 | Y)
Justification: The administrator's authority is extinguished during the absence of the absentee, which triggers the family court's potential intervention. Since this factor implies a need for court action, the defendant is obligated.


(5 | N)
Justification: An interested person or a public prosecutor can request the family court to take action regarding the administration of the absentee's property. However, this factor alone does not directly imply an obligation on the defendant, as it only grants a right to request action.


(1, 2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The person is considered an "absentee", the absentee has not appointed an administrator for their property, and the absentee may appoint an administrator after an order has been issued by the family court. This combination of factors indicates that the defendant's obligations are directly tied to the administration of the absentee's property, and therefore, they are obligated.


(3, 7 | Y)
Justification: The family court may order necessary dispositions with regard to the administration of the absentee's property at the request of an interested person or a public prosecutor, and the authority of the newly appointed administrator can lead to the rescission of the previous order. This combination of factors implies that the defendant is obligated to comply with the court's orders regarding property administration.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if an absentee has not appointed an administrator for the person's property, not only interested persons but also public prosecutors may request the family court to order the necessary dispositions with regard to the administration of that property. This statement aligns with Article 25(1), which explicitly mentions that the family court may order necessary dispositions at the request of "an interested person or a public prosecutor." Therefore, based on the information provided in the article, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning for all factors.

1. **A person is considered an "absentee" if they have taken leave of their domicile or residence.**
   - (query entails 1) The query implies this condition by referring to an "absentee," which aligns with the definition provided in the article.

2. **The absentee has not appointed an administrator for their property.**
   - (query entails 2) This is directly mentioned in the query as a prerequisite for the action described.

3. **The family court may order necessary dispositions with regard to the administration of the absentee's property at the request of an interested person or a public prosecutor.**
   - (query entails 3) The query specifically mentions that not only interested persons but also public prosecutors may request such actions, aligning with this factor.

4. **The administrator's authority is extinguished during the absence of the absentee, which triggers the family court's potential intervention.**
   - (query does not entail 4) This scenario is mentioned in the article as another condition under which the family court may intervene but is not addressed in the query.

5. **An interested person or a public prosecutor can request the family court to take action regarding the administration of the absentee's property.**
   - (query entails 5) The query directly states this, emphasizing that both interested persons and public prosecutors have this capability.

6. **The absentee may appoint an administrator after an order has been issued by the family court.**
   - (query does not entail 6) This situation is described in Article 25(2) but is not mentioned or implied in the query.

7. **The authority of the newly appointed administrator can lead to the rescission of the previous order.**
   - (query does not entail 7) Similar to factor 6, this outcome is detailed in the article but not referenced in the query.

These justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is True based on the factors it directly addresses.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context and content of the query, it does not explicitly impose an obligation on a defendant but rather describes a procedural possibility under specific conditions. Therefore, the query does not determine the defendant obligated in the sense of imposing a legal duty or liability directly through its statement. Hence, **pledged(0)**.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 298, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The holder of a right of retention must possess the thing retained with the due care of a prudent manager.
2. The holder of the right of retention may not use, lease or provide as a security the thing retained unless that holder obtains the consent of the obligor.
3. There is an exception to the prohibition on using the thing retained, which applies to uses necessary for the preservation of that thing.
4. The holder of the right of retention must obtain the consent of the obligor before using, leasing, or providing as a security the thing retained, except in cases of use necessary for preservation.
5. A violation of the provisions by the holder of the right of retention can lead to termination of the right.

Verdict: If the holder of a right of retention violates the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs, the obligor may demand that the right of retention be terminated.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 298, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors.

1. (1 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs: The holder of a right of retention must possess the thing retained with the due care of a prudent manager. However, possessing the thing with due care does not inherently obligate the defendant without further actions or violations of the article's provisions. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

2. (2 | N)
Here, only factor 2 is present: The holder of the right of retention may not use, lease or provide as a security the thing retained unless that holder obtains the consent of the obligor. Without any indication that this rule was violated or that consent was not obtained when necessary, there's no basis to obligate the defendant solely on the existence of this rule.

3. (1, 2 | N)
In this case, both factor 1 (due care) and factor 2 (prohibition on use without consent) are considered. Even with both factors present, if the holder has taken due care and not used the thing without consent, there's no violation of Article 298, and thus, the defendant is not obligated.

4. (3, 4 | Y)
This scenario involves factors 3 (exception for preservation) and 4 (requirement for consent except in cases of use necessary for preservation). If the holder uses the thing retained without consent but claims it was necessary for preservation (and this claim is validated), they might still be acting within their rights under the exception. However, if the use was not genuinely for preservation or if other violations occurred, the defendant could be obligated due to a misunderstanding or misapplication of these factors. Given the specific involvement of exceptions and consent requirements, the scenario suggests a situation where obligations could arise from misuse or misinterpretation of these provisions.

5. (1, 2, 5 | Y)
In this final scenario, factors 1 (due care), 2 (prohibition on use without consent), and 5 (violation leading to termination of the right) are all present. Here, if the holder fails to possess the thing with due care or uses it without consent, violating the provisions of Article 298, and this violation is significant enough to warrant the termination of the right of retention as per factor 5, then the defendant would indeed be legally obligated.

 After carefully reading Article 196, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list:

1. The possessor returns a thing in their possession.
2. The possessor has paid costs for the preservation of the thing.
3. The possessor has incurred other necessary expenses related to the thing.
4. The possessor has acquired fruits from the thing.
5. Ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor if they have acquired fruits.

7. The possessor has incurred other beneficial expenses related to the thing.
8. There is a current increase in value of the thing due to the possessor's improvements or expenses.
9. The person recovering the thing may choose between reimbursing the possessor for either the costs paid or the amount of the increased value.
10. The possessor is in bad faith.

Verdict: The possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for the costs the possessor has paid for its preservation and other necessary expenses, or for the costs paid to improve the thing or the amount of the increased value, under certain conditions. 
Verdict: The court may grant a reasonable period of time to a possessor in bad faith at the request of the person recovering the thing.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 196, I will generate 10 unique legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of factors.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The possessor has returned the thing in their possession and has paid costs for its preservation. According to Article 196(1), the possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for these costs.

2. (3, 5 | N)
Justification: Although the possessor has incurred other necessary expenses and has acquired fruits from the thing, Article 196(1) states that ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor if they have acquired fruits. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated to reimburse these expenses.

3. (4, 6 | Y)
Justification: The possessor has acquired fruits from the thing and has paid costs to improve it. Article 196(2) allows the possessor to be reimbursed for either the costs paid or the amount of the increased value, making the defendant obligated to reimburse these expenses.

4. (7, 8 | Y)
Justification: The possessor has incurred other beneficial expenses and there is a current increase in value due to their improvements or expenses. According to Article 196(2), the person recovering the thing may choose between reimbursing the possessor for either the costs paid or the amount of the increased value, making the defendant obligated.

5. (1, 9 | Y)
Justification: The possessor has returned the thing in their possession and the person recovering the thing may choose between reimbursing the possessor for either the costs paid or the amount of the increased value. This choice implies that the defendant is obligated to reimburse some expenses.

6. (2, 10 | N)
Justification: Although the possessor has paid costs for preservation and is in bad faith, Article 196(2) only grants the court the power to grant a reasonable period of time at the request of the person recovering the thing, but does not automatically obligate the defendant to reimburse these expenses.

7. (3, 6 | Y)
Justification: The possessor has incurred other necessary expenses and has paid costs to improve the thing. Article 196(1) and (2) allow for reimbursement of preservation and improvement costs, respectively, making the defendant obligated to reimburse these expenses.

8. (4, 7 | N)
Justification: Although the possessor has acquired fruits from the thing and has incurred other beneficial expenses, Article 196(1) states that ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor if they have acquired fruits, and there is no explicit mention of reimbursing beneficial expenses in this scenario.

9. (5, 8 | N)
Justification: The possessor has acquired fruits from the thing and there is a current increase in value due to their improvements or expenses. However, Article 196(1) states that ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor if they have acquired fruits, and the increased value does not automatically obligate the defendant to reimburse these expenses without other factors being present.

10. (9, 10 | Y)
Justification: The person recovering the thing may choose between reimbursing the possessor for either the costs paid or the amount of the increased value, and the possessor is in bad faith. According to Article 196(2), the court may grant a reasonable period of time at the request of the person recovering the thing, implying that the defendant is obligated to reimburse some expenses or face further action.

Task Definition:

Task 1:
Given a set of articles, determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Task 2:
Given the query and a list of factors, assess whether the query expresses each factor. The query expresses a factor if it considers evidence within a similar situation or scenario as the factor. Justify your reasoning for all factors. Then, verify whether your justifications align with the result from Task 1. Then you must output following format: (query entails X) if query entails factor X.


Task 3:
Determine whether the query determine the defendant obligated. If yes, represent it as format pledged(1). If not, present it as pledged(0).
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that even in cases where a possessor paid ordinary necessary expenses with respect to the thing in his/her possession, he/she may not have the person recovering the thing reimburse them if the possessor has acquired fruits. According to Article 196, specifically point (1), it is mentioned that "if the possessor has acquired fruits, ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor." This implies that the possessor indeed cannot be reimbursed for ordinary and necessary expenses if they have acquired fruits from the thing in their possession. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the content of Article 196, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. The possessor returns a thing in their possession - The query does not directly address this condition; it focuses on reimbursement for expenses.
   - (query entails 1) is False.

2. The possessor has paid costs for the preservation of the thing - This is implied as part of "ordinary necessary expenses."
   - (query entails 2) is True, in a general sense related to expenses.

3. The possessor has incurred other necessary expenses related to the thing - Similar to factor 2, this is about expenses but not directly addressed.
   - (query entails 3) is False, as it specifically mentions "ordinary necessary expenses."

4. The possessor has acquired fruits from the thing - This is a key condition in the query.
   - (query entails 4) is True.

5. Ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor if they have acquired fruits - This directly aligns with the query's statement.
   - (query entails 5) is True.

6. The possessor has paid costs to improve the thing in their possession - The query does not address improvements, only "ordinary necessary expenses."
   - (query entails 6) is False.

7. The possessor has incurred other beneficial expenses related to the thing - Similar to factor 6, this is not directly addressed.
   - (query entails 7) is False.

8. There is a current increase in value of the thing due to the possessor's improvements or expenses - This factor is not mentioned in the query.
   - (query entails 8) is False.

9. The person recovering the thing may choose between reimbursing the possessor for either the costs paid or the amount of the increased value - The query does not address this choice directly; it focuses on a scenario where reimbursement might not occur.
   - (query entails 9) is False.

10. The possessor is in bad faith - This condition is not mentioned in the query.
    - (query entails 10) is False.

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True, specifically focusing on the conditions related to acquired fruits and ordinary necessary expenses.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given that the query addresses a specific scenario where reimbursement may not be possible for the possessor (if they have acquired fruits), it implies certain obligations based on Article 196. However, the query itself does not directly impose an obligation but rather describes a condition under which the possessor cannot be reimbursed. Thus, in terms of determining the defendant's obligation to reimburse based solely on the information given in the query:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 169, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list:

* The period of prescription of a right determined by a final and binding judgment is a factor.
* A final and binding judgment has the same effect as anything that has the same effect as a final and binding judgment, which is also a factor.
* The period of prescription being 10 years is a key factor, even if a period of prescription shorter than 10 years is provided for.
* A claim being not yet due and payable at the time when it is determined is another factor.
* The provisions of paragraph (1) do not apply to claims that meet certain conditions, specifically those that are not yet due and payable.

Verdict: The period of prescription of a right determined by a final and binding judgment or anything that has the same effect as a final and binding judgment is 10 years, unless the claim is not yet due and payable at the time when it is determined.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors extracted from Article 169, I will generate five unique case scenarios, each with a distinct combination of factors. Here are the cases:


(1 | Y)
Justification: The period of prescription of a right determined by a final and binding judgment is a factor. In this case, the defendant's right was determined by a final and binding judgment, which triggers the 10-year prescription period. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.


(2 | Y)
Justification: A final and binding judgment has the same effect as anything that has the same effect as a final and binding judgment. Since this condition is met, the defendant's obligation is established, regardless of whether it's a traditional judgment or an equivalent determination.


(3 | Y)
Justification: The period of prescription being 10 years is a key factor, even if a period of prescription shorter than 10 years is provided for. In this case, the 10-year prescription period applies, making the defendant legally obligated to adhere to this timeframe.


(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The combination of factors 1 and 2 indicates that the defendant's right was determined by a final and binding judgment (or its equivalent). This dual confirmation of the judgment's effect solidifies the defendant's obligation, as both conditions point to the same outcome.


(4, 5 | N)
Justification: A claim being not yet due and payable at the time when it is determined (factor 4), combined with the provisions of paragraph (1) not applying to such claims (factor 5), means that the defendant is not legally obligated. The exemption for non-due claims takes precedence, releasing the defendant from obligation.


Note: These cases are designed to demonstrate the application of Article 169's factors in various scenarios, ensuring a clear verdict for each combination of factors.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down each task in relation to the provided article and query.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that "The period of prescription of a right to demand compensation for damages in tort established in an unappealable judgment shall be ten years." 

Article 169(1) mentions that "The period of prescription of a right determined by a final and binding judgment or anything that has the same effect as a final and binding judgment is 10 years even if a period of prescription shorter than 10 years is provided for."

Given this, an unappealable judgment can be considered to have the same effect as a final and binding judgment. Therefore, based on Article 169(1), the query's statement about the period of prescription being ten years aligns with what is stated in the article, making the query **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The period of prescription of a right determined by a final and binding judgment is a factor.**
   - The query directly mentions "the period of prescription of a right to demand compensation for damages in tort established in an unappealable judgment," which aligns with this factor. Therefore, (query entails 1).

2. **A final and binding judgment has the same effect as anything that has the same effect as a final and binding judgment, which is also a factor.**
   - The query implies an unappealable judgment has a similar effect to a final and binding judgment, thus considering this factor. Therefore, (query entails 2).

3. **The period of prescription being 10 years is a key factor, even if a period of prescription shorter than 10 years is provided for.**
   - The query states the period shall be ten years, directly aligning with this factor. Therefore, (query entails 3).

4. **A claim being not yet due and payable at the time when it is determined is another factor.**
   - The query does not explicitly mention claims that are not yet due and payable. This scenario is an exception in Article 169(2), but since the query doesn't address this, it's not directly considered. Therefore, (query does not entail 4).

5. **The provisions of paragraph (1) do not apply to claims that meet certain conditions, specifically those that are not yet due and payable.**
   - Similar to factor 4, the query doesn't address exceptions for claims not yet due and payable, so it's not directly considered. Therefore, (query does not entail 5).

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming the query is true based on the factors directly addressed.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query discusses the period of prescription for demanding compensation in tort established by an unappealable judgment but does not explicitly state that the defendant is obligated to pay or fulfill any specific action without further context. However, in the context of seeking compensation for damages in tort via a judicial process (like an unappealable judgment), it implies that if such a right exists and the claimant acts within the prescribed period, the defendant could be obligated to compensate. But since the query itself does not directly determine or imply an immediate obligation without additional context (such as the specifics of the tort or the judgment's details), for the purpose of this task and based on the information given:

 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A person who has begun to manage a business for another person without being obligated to do so is referred to as a "manager".
2. The manager must manage the business in accordance with the nature of the business.
3. The manager must manage the business in the way that best suits the interests of the principal, which is referred to as "benevolent intervention in another's business".

9. If the mandatary is no longer able to perform the mandated business due to grounds not attributable to the mandator, they may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed.
10. If the mandate is terminated during the course of performance, the mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed.

Verdict: A manager must engage in benevolent intervention in another's business and may or may not be entitled to remuneration depending on the specific circumstances of the case.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 10 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The defendant has begun to manage a business for another person without being obligated to do so, which establishes them as a "manager" and triggers the obligations outlined in Article 697.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The defendant is managing the business in accordance with its nature (factor 2) and in the best interests of the principal (factor 3), demonstrating benevolent intervention in another's business. This suggests the defendant is acting in good faith and is therefore obligated to continue managing the business.

(4 | N)
Justification: Although the defendant knows or can conjecture the intention of the principal, this alone does not establish an obligation without additional factors such as management of the business or benevolent intervention.

(5, 1 | Y)
Justification: The provisions of Article 645 through Article 647 apply to the defendant's actions (factor 5), and they are considered a manager (factor 1). This combination suggests that the defendant is subject to specific guidelines in managing the business, indicating an obligation to adhere to those guidelines.

(6 | N)
Justification: The absence of special agreements regarding remuneration means the defendant cannot claim payment for their services. Without additional factors indicating management or benevolent intervention, this does not establish an obligation.

(7, 8 | Y)
Justification: The defendant is entitled to remuneration after performing the mandated business (factor 7) and the remuneration may be specified with reference to a period (factor 8). This suggests that there was an expectation of payment for services rendered, implying an agreement or obligation between the parties.

(9 | Y)
Justification: The defendant is no longer able to perform the mandated business due to grounds not attributable to the principal. In this scenario, the defendant may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed, indicating that there was indeed an obligation to manage the business until it became impossible to do so.

(10 | Y)
Justification: The mandate being terminated during the course of performance allows the defendant to demand remuneration in proportion to the work done. This factor directly implies that the defendant had an obligation to perform the work until the termination.

(2, 6 | N)
Justification: Although the defendant is managing the business according to its nature (factor 2), the absence of any special agreements regarding remuneration (factor 6) means there's no clear obligation for payment. Without additional factors indicating benevolent intervention or knowledge of the principal's intentions, this combination does not establish a legal obligation.

(3, 4 | Y)
Justification: The defendant is managing the business in the best interests of the principal (factor 3) and knows or can conjecture the intention of the principal (factor 4). This combination suggests that the defendant is acting with full knowledge of the principal's wishes and in their best interest, indicating a strong obligation to continue managing the business as intended.

query: In case that the obligee is found to have reasonable grounds in light of the common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be diminished, the guarantor may not assert that the guarantor is relieved from responsibility to the extent that that the guarantor can no longer seek the reimbursement due to the diminution in the security available upon subrogation.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 504, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

1. There is a person with a legitimate interest in performing an obligation, referred to as a "person entitled to subrogation".
2. The obligee causes the security thereof to be lost or diminished.
3. The loss or diminution of security is intentional or negligent.
4. The person entitled to subrogation can no longer seek reimbursement due to the loss or diminution in the security available upon subrogation.
5. The person entitled to subrogation is a third-party collateral provider.
6. A third party has acquired from the person entitled to subrogation the property that is the subject of security.
7. There is a specific successor of the third party that has acquired the property.
8. The obligee has reasonable grounds in light of common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be lost or diminished.

Verdict: If factors 1-4 are met, the person entitled to subrogation is relieved from responsibility to the extent that they can no longer seek reimbursement due to the loss or diminution in the security available upon subrogation, unless factor 8 applies.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the factors outlined in Article 504, we will create eight unique cases, each using a different combination of the factors. We aim to determine whether the defendant (the person entitled to subrogation) is legally obligated based on the occurrence of these factors.

### Case 1: Basic Obligation Scenario
(1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This case meets the fundamental criteria for relieving the person entitled to subrogation from responsibility. Since there's a person with a legitimate interest (factor 1), the obligee causes security loss or diminution (factor 2), and this is done intentionally or negligently (factor 3), the defendant can be relieved from responsibility, implying they are initially obligated but can seek relief.

### Case 2: Third-Party Collateral Provider
(1, 5 | N)
Justification: Here, we only consider the presence of a person with legitimate interest (factor 1) and that this person is a third-party collateral provider (factor 5). Without the obligee causing loss or diminution of security or any intent/negligence, the defendant's obligation status doesn't directly trigger relief under Article 504, suggesting they remain obligated.

### Case 3: Loss of Security and Succession
(2, 6, 7 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the obligee causes loss or diminution of security (factor 2), a third party acquires the secured property from the person entitled to subrogation (factor 6), and there's a specific successor of this third party (factor 7). The focus on the chain of property transfer implies that the original defendant's obligation could be affected by these transactions, potentially relieving them of responsibility due to circumstances beyond their control.

### Case 4: Intentional Acts and Reimbursement
(3, 4 | Y)
Justification: This case involves intentional or negligent acts by the obligee (factor 3) leading to a situation where the person entitled to subrogation can no longer seek reimbursement due to the loss or diminution in security (factor 4). The intent/negligence coupled with the inability to seek reimbursement suggests that the defendant's obligation is impacted, potentially relieving them of full responsibility.

### Case 5: Legitimate Interest and Reasonable Grounds
(1, 8 | N)
Justification: Here, we consider a person with legitimate interest (factor 1) and the obligee having reasonable grounds for their actions (factor 8). The presence of reasonable grounds justifies the obligee's actions, potentially maintaining the defendant's full obligation since the grounds mitigate against relief under Article 504.

### Case 6: Third-Party Acquisition and Succession
(5, 6, 7 | Y)
Justification: Involving a third-party collateral provider (factor 5), a third party acquiring the secured property (factor 6), and a specific successor of this third party (factor 7), this scenario suggests a complex chain of obligations. The defendant's responsibility could be affected by these transactions, potentially altering their obligation status due to the changed circumstances regarding the security.

### Case 7: Negligence and Loss of Reimbursement Opportunity
(2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: This case combines the obligee causing loss or diminution of security (factor 2), intentional or negligent actions (factor 3), and the person entitled to subrogation being unable to seek reimbursement due to this loss (factor 4). The combination strongly supports relieving the defendant from responsibility, as the negligence and consequent loss directly impact their ability to fulfill obligations.

### Case 8: Full Scenario with Reasonable Grounds
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 | N)
Justification: This comprehensive scenario includes all factors. However, the presence of factor 8 (reasonable grounds for the obligee's actions) overrides the relief conditions outlined in Article 504, suggesting that despite the complex circumstances, the defendant remains obligated due to the justified actions of the obligee.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 504, leading to determinate verdicts regarding the defendant's legal obligations based on the specific circumstances presented.

Verdict: A person that has performed the obligation for the benefit of the obligor is subrogated to the claim of the obligee, with the exercise of rights and subrogation subject to the factors listed above.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 12 unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
The defendant performed the obligation for the benefit of the obligor, which directly triggers subrogation to the claim of the obligee according to factor 1. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
In this case, the provisions of Article 467 apply mutatis mutandis, and the person subrogated to the claim of the obligee can exercise any and all rights possessed by the obligee. Since factor 2 allows for these provisions unless a person with a legitimate interest is subrogated, and factor 3 grants the exercise of rights, the defendant's ability to act on behalf of the obligee indicates legal obligation.

3. (4 | N)
The exercise of rights by the person subrogated to the claim of the obligee is limited to the extent they can seek reimbursement based on their own rights. If this is the only factor present, it implies limitations rather than obligations, so the defendant is not legally obligated solely based on this.

4. (1, 5 | Y)
Combining factors 1 and 5, the person who performed the obligation for the benefit of the obligor is subrogated to the claim of the obligee and can exercise rights in relation to other guarantors to the extent they are entitled to seek reimbursement from those guarantors. This scenario clearly establishes a legal obligation on the part of the defendant.

5. (6, 7 | N)
Here, factor 6 states that a third party acquirer is not subrogated to the claim in relation to any guarantors or third-party collateral providers, and factor 7 allows for subrogation among third party acquirers proportionally. Since these factors discuss scenarios where obligations might be nuanced or absent between certain parties (like third party acquirers and guarantors), it suggests that the defendant is not directly obligated in this context.

6. (3, 8 | Y)
Factor 3 allows a person subrogated to the claim of the obligee to exercise all rights possessed by the obligee, and factor 8 extends similar provisions to third-party collateral providers. This combination supports the defendant being legally obligated as they can act fully on behalf of the obligee.

7. (9 | Y)
The subrogation between a guarantor and a third-party collateral provider depends on the number of persons involved. This implies that the obligation is determined by the specific roles and numbers of parties, indicating that the defendant would be legally obligated based on their role within this framework.

8. (10, 11 | Y)
Factor 10 describes how multiple third-party collateral providers are subrogated in proportion to the property price after deducting the guarantor's share, and factor 11 extends provisions to those who acquire from third party acquirers. This detailed mechanism for apportioning obligations suggests that the defendant would indeed be legally obligated under these specific conditions.

9. (2, 4 | N)
In this scenario, the provisions of Article 467 apply, but the exercise of rights is limited to seeking reimbursement based on one's own rights. The combination does not establish a direct obligation since it focuses more on procedural aspects and limitations rather than imposing an obligation.

10. (1, 9 | Y)
The person who performed the obligation for the benefit of the obligor is subrogated to the claim of the obligee, and the subrogation between different types of providers depends on their numbers. This scenario directly implies that the defendant has taken on obligations by performing the obligation and being part of a potentially complex web of subrogations.

11. (5, 6 | N)
Here, factor 5 limits the exercise of rights in relation to other guarantors based on reimbursement entitlements, and factor 6 states that third party acquirers are not subrogated in relation to guarantors or collateral providers. This combination highlights limitations and exclusions rather than direct obligations, indicating the defendant is not obligated.

12. (3, 12 | Y)
The person subrogated to the claim of the obligee can exercise all rights possessed by the obligee, and those who acquire from third-party collateral providers are deemed to be such providers with applicable provisions. This scenario supports the defendant being legally obligated as they can fully act on behalf of the obligee and are subject to specific regulatory provisions based on their acquisitions.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's legal obligations.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 511, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* A third party obligor of a claim which has been attached may not assert set-off as defense with any claim acquired after the attachment against the attaching obligee.
* The third party obligor may duly assert against the same a set-off based using a claim acquired before the attachment.
* A claim acquired after the attachment may be used for set-off if it has arisen from a cause that existed before the attachment.
* The third party obligor must have acquired the claim directly, not through acquiring the claim of another person after the attachment.

Verdict: A third party obligor of a claim which has been attached may not assert set-off as defense with any claim acquired after the attachment against the attaching obligee, but may duly assert against the same a set-off based using a claim acquired before the attachment, unless the claim acquired after the attachment has arisen from a cause that existed before the attachment and was not acquired through acquiring the claim of another person.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 511, I will generate four legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | N)
In this case, the only factor present is that "A third party obligor of a claim which has been attached may not assert set-off as defense with any claim acquired after the attachment against the attaching obligee." Since the claim was acquired after the attachment and no exceptions apply, the defendant is not obligated to allow set-off. The absence of any claims acquired before the attachment or causes existing before the attachment means the defendant does not have a basis for set-off under Article 511.

2. (2 | Y)
Here, the factor present is "The third party obligor may duly assert against the same a set-off based using a claim acquired before the attachment." This directly indicates that if the claim was acquired before the attachment, the defendant can use it for set-off against the attaching obligee. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated to allow this set-off.

3. (1, 3 | Y)
In this scenario, two factors are present: "A third party obligor of a claim which has been attached may not assert set-off as defense with any claim acquired after the attachment against the attaching obligee" and "A claim acquired after the attachment may be used for set-off if it has arisen from a cause that existed before the attachment." The exception provided by the second factor overrides the general rule in the first factor, allowing the defendant to use the claim for set-off because it arose from a cause existing before the attachment. Thus, despite initially appearing not to be able to assert set-off due to the timing of claim acquisition, the specific circumstances permit it, making the defendant obligated.

4. (1, 3, 4 | N)
This case includes all factors: "A third party obligor of a claim which has been attached may not assert set-off as defense with any claim acquired after the attachment against the attaching obligee," "A claim acquired after the attachment may be used for set-off if it has arisen from a cause that existed before the attachment," and "The third party obligor must have acquired the claim directly, not through acquiring the claim of another person after the attachment." Although the claim arose from a cause before the attachment, which would normally allow for set-off under Article 511's exception, the fact that it was acquired through purchasing the claim of another person after the attachment invalidates this basis for set-off. Therefore, despite having a claim with a pre-existing cause, the method of acquisition disqualifies it from being used for set-off, meaning the defendant is not obligated to allow it.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding whether the defendant is legally obligated to accept set-off under Article 511.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The subject matter delivered to the buyer does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind, quality, or quantity.
2. The buyer demands that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance by repairing the subject matter, delivering a substitute, or delivering replenishment.
3. The seller may cure the non-conformity of performance by a method different from the method demanded by the buyer if it does not impose any undue burden on the buyer.
4. The non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer.
5. A party to a bilateral contract has an obligation to perform.
6. The other party's obligation (including the performance of an obligation to compensate for loss or damage in lieu of the performance of an obligation) is not yet due.
7. The buyer may demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance under certain provisions.

Verdict: If the subject matter delivered to the buyer does not conform to the terms of the contract, the buyer may demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance, unless the non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer. 
Verdict: A party to a bilateral contract may refuse to perform their own obligation until the other party tenders the performance of their obligation, unless the obligation of the other party is not yet due.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The subject matter delivered to the buyer does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind, quality, or quantity. According to Article 562, this entitles the buyer to demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance. Therefore, the defendant (seller) is legally obligated to take action.

(2 | Y)
Justification: The buyer demands that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance by repairing the subject matter, delivering a substitute, or delivering replenishment. As stated in Article 562, this demand can be made when the subject matter does not conform to the contract terms. Since factor 2 is present, it implies that the defendant has been given an opportunity to rectify the situation and thus is obligated to respond.

(1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The combination of factors indicates that the subject matter delivered does not conform to the contract (factor 1), and the seller may cure this non-conformity by a different method than demanded if it doesn't impose an undue burden on the buyer (factor 3). Given these conditions, the defendant is obligated to find a suitable remedy for the non-conformity that works for both parties.

(4 | N)
Justification: The non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer. According to Article 562(2), if the non-conformity is the buyer's fault, they cannot demand that the seller cure it. Therefore, in this scenario, the defendant (seller) is not obligated to take corrective action.

(5 | Y)
Justification: A party to a bilateral contract has an obligation to perform. This fundamental principle implies that if one party has an obligation due, they are expected to fulfill it unless there's a valid reason for refusal, such as the other party not being ready to perform their part (as per Article 533). Thus, the presence of this factor alone indicates an obligation on the defendant.

(6 | N)
Justification: The other party's obligation is not yet due. As stated in Article 533, a party can refuse to perform if the other party's obligation has not yet come due. Since this condition applies, the defendant cannot be compelled to perform their obligation prematurely and thus is not obligated at this time.

(2, 7 | Y)
Justification: The buyer demands that the seller cure the non-conformity (factor 2), and the buyer may demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance under certain provisions (factor 7). These factors together reinforce the notion that the defendant has a clear legal path to rectify the situation as demanded by the buyer, indicating an obligation to do so.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze the given civil legal article context, let's break down the information into key phrases or sentences that represent factors used in determining verdicts in cases applying these articles.

1. **Provisions Application**: The provisions of Article 296, Article 304, and Article 351 apply mutatis mutandis to mortgages.
2. **Right of Retention**: A holder of a right of retention may exercise that holder's rights against the whole of the thing retained.
3. **Condition for Exercising Rights**: The exercise of the right of retention is until the relevant claim is satisfied in its entirety.
4. **Scope of Application**: The provisions apply to the whole of the thing retained, implying comprehensive coverage.
5. **Mutatis Mutandis Application**: The application of provisions from other articles (296, 304, and 351) to mortgages implies an adaptation or adjustment of these provisions to fit the context of mortgages.

Verdict: The provisions of Article 296, Article 304, and Article 351 apply mutatis mutandis to mortgages, allowing a holder of a right of retention to exercise their rights against the whole of the thing retained until the relevant claim is satisfied in its entirety.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each using a unique combination of factors.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the provisions of Article 296, Article 304, and Article 351 apply mutatis mutandis to mortgages (Factor 1), and the defendant is a holder of a right of retention who may exercise their rights against the whole of the thing retained (Factor 2). Given that these provisions allow for the adaptation of rights to fit the context of mortgages and provide a clear basis for exercising retention rights, the defendant is legally obligated.

2. (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: Here, the condition for exercising rights is that the relevant claim must be satisfied in its entirety (Factor 3), and the scope of application includes the whole of the thing retained (Factor 4). Since these factors outline specific conditions under which rights can be exercised comprehensively, the defendant would be legally obligated to adhere to these conditions.

3. (1, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the provisions apply mutatis mutandis to mortgages (Factor 1), and there's an application of provisions from other articles to mortgages with necessary adaptations (Factor 5). The combination of these factors indicates that the legal framework is designed to accommodate mortgages specifically, suggesting that the defendant is obligated under the adapted provisions.

4. (2, 3 | N)
Justification: Although the defendant has a right of retention and may exercise it against the whole of the thing retained (Factor 2), and there's a condition that the relevant claim must be satisfied in its entirety (Factor 3), without explicit application to mortgages or comprehensive scope as per other factors, the obligation is less clear. The absence of specific provisions applying to mortgages or a comprehensive scope might suggest ambiguity rather than a definitive legal obligation.

5. (4, 5 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves the scope of application being the whole of the thing retained (Factor 4) and the mutatis mutandis application of provisions from other articles to mortgages (Factor 5). Given that these factors imply both comprehensive coverage and an adaptation for mortgage contexts, it's reasonable to conclude that the defendant is legally obligated under these specifically tailored conditions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.
2. The act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.
3. The beneficiary of the act does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.
4. The subject matter of the act is a property right.
5. The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act.
6. The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.

Verdict: The court may rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee, if the conditions in factors 1-6 are met, as stated in paragraphs (1)-(4) of Article 424.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate six legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, the obligee demands the court to rescind an act that the obligor committed knowing it would prejudice the obligee (factor 1), and the act was indeed committed with such knowledge (factor 2). Since both conditions are met, the defendant is legally obligated to have the act rescinded.

2. (3, 4 | N)
Here, the beneficiary of the act does not know that the obligee will be prejudiced (factor 3), and the subject matter of the act is a property right (factor 4). However, without the obligor's knowledge of prejudice (factor 2) or the obligee's demand (factor 1), the defendant cannot be held obligated solely based on these factors.

3. (1, 5 | Y)
In this scenario, the obligee demands the court to rescind an act (factor 1), and the obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act (factor 5). Given the direct demand and pre-existing claim, the defendant can be considered legally obligated, as these factors directly relate to the obligee's rights and the timing of their claim.

4. (2, 6 | Y)
This case involves an act committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee (factor 2), and the obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution (factor 6). The combination of the obligor's intent to prejudice and the enforceability of the claim supports the conclusion that the defendant is legally obligated, as these factors establish both intent and a viable legal remedy.

5. (3, 5 | N)
In this case, the beneficiary does not know that the obligee will be prejudiced (factor 3), and the obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act (factor 5). Without evidence of the obligor's knowledge of prejudice or a direct demand from the obligee, these factors alone do not establish sufficient grounds to obligate the defendant.

6. (4, 6 | N)
Here, the subject matter of the act is a property right (factor 4), and the obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution (factor 6). Although these factors are relevant to the legal framework surrounding property rights and claim enforcement, they do not directly address the conditions under which an act can be rescinded due to prejudice. Therefore, based solely on these factors, the defendant cannot be considered legally obligated without additional context or factors being present.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Assessing the Query's Validity
The query states that "The rescission of a fraudulent act is performed by the court based on the demand of the obligee." According to Article 424, an obligee may indeed demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing it will prejudice the obligee. Therefore, based on the information provided in Article 424, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Evaluating Factor Expression
Let's evaluate each factor against the query:

1. The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.
   - (query entails 1) because the query directly mentions the demand for rescission of a fraudulent act by the obligee.

2. The act must be committed by the obligor with knowledge that it will prejudice the obligee.
   - The query does not explicitly mention the obligor's knowledge but focuses on the action and its classification as "fraudulent," implying some form of intent or knowledge. Thus, it indirectly considers this factor: (query entails 2).

3. The beneficiary of the act does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.
   - This factor is not directly addressed by the query, which focuses on the demand for rescission rather than the knowledge of beneficiaries: (query does not entail 3).

4. The subject matter of the act is a property right.
   - The query does not specify the nature of the act beyond it being "fraudulent," so this factor is not directly considered: (query does not entail 4).

5. The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act.
   - This temporal relationship and causation are implied in the context of demanding rescission but are not explicitly stated in the query: (query does not entail 5).

6. The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.
   - Like factors 3, 4, and 5, this condition for making a demand is not mentioned in the query: (query does not entail 6).

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is essentially true but highlights it doesn't cover all conditions specified in Article 424.

### Task 3: Determining Obligation
Given the context of Article 424 and the focus of the query on the court's action based on the obligee's demand, the query suggests a scenario where the defendant (obligor) is potentially obligated to have their act rescinded if it meets certain criteria. However, the query itself does not directly determine or imply that the defendant is always obligated; rather, it outlines a process by which obligations can be addressed. Therefore, in terms of determining an obligation based solely on the query's statement without considering all factors from Article 424: **pledged(0)**.

In summary:
- The query is True regarding the role of the court and the obligee.
- (query entails 1) and indirectly (query entails 2), but does not directly entail factors 3 through 6.
- pledged(0) because the query describes a process rather than definitively stating an obligation for all cases.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Let's break down Article 509 into its constituent factors:

1. The obligor of certain obligations may not duly assert a set-off against the obligee.
2. The obligations in question include an obligation for compensation for loss or damage based on a tort committed in bad faith.
3. The obligations also include an obligation for compensation for loss or damage for death or injury to person (excluding the one set forth in the preceding item, i.e., bad faith tort).
4. An exception applies if the obligee acquires a claim corresponding to the relevant obligation from another person.

Verdict: The obligor of either of the mentioned obligations may not duly assert a set-off against the obligee; provided, however, that this does not apply if the obligee acquires a claim corresponding to the relevant obligation from another person.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 509, I will generate four legal case scenarios corresponding to the four factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: The first factor alone does not provide sufficient information about the type of obligation or any exceptions that may apply. Without knowing the specific obligation or whether an exception is relevant, we cannot determine that the defendant is obligated.

(2 | Y)
Justification: If the obligor has an obligation for compensation for loss or damage based on a tort committed in bad faith, then according to Article 509, they may not duly assert a set-off against the obligee. This implies that the defendant is indeed obligated, as they cannot use set-off as a defense.

(3 | Y)
Justification: Similar to the previous case, if the obligor has an obligation for compensation for loss or damage for death or injury to person (excluding bad faith tort), then according to Article 509, they may not duly assert a set-off against the obligee. This also implies that the defendant is obligated.

(2, 4 | N)
Justification: In this case, we have an obligation for compensation for loss or damage based on a tort committed in bad faith (factor 2), but we also have the exception that the obligee acquired a claim corresponding to the relevant obligation from another person (factor 4). According to Article 509, this exception allows the obligor to assert a set-off against the obligee. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

Note: I've made sure that no two cases use the same combination of factors and provided a clear justification for each case based on the article.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

Given Article 509 and its explanation, we can deduce that an obligor cannot assert a set-off against an obligee for certain obligations, specifically those involving compensation for loss or damage due to torts committed in bad faith or for death/injury to a person. The query posits a scenario where a person (who has borne an obligation for compensation for loss or damage for injury to another) attempts to assert a set-off using a monetary claim against that obligation for compensation.

Based on Article 509, if the person attempting the set-off is the obligor of an obligation for compensation due to injury (which falls under one of the specified categories), and they are trying to set off this obligation with a monetary claim they hold against the obligee, then according to the article, they may not duly assert this set-off unless an exception applies (e.g., if the obligee acquired their claim from another person).

Therefore, logically, without considering any exceptions, the query's statement aligns with what Article 509 dictates for such obligations. Hence, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 509, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The obligor of certain obligations may not duly assert a set-off against the obligee.**
   - The query expresses this factor as it discusses a scenario where an obligor (the person with the monetary claim) attempts to assert a set-off, which is not allowed according to Article 509 for the specified obligations.

2. **The obligations in question include an obligation for compensation for loss or damage based on a tort committed in bad faith.**
   - The query does not directly mention "bad faith" but involves compensation for injury, implying it could fall under the broader category of obligations for compensation due to harm caused, thus indirectly expressing this factor.

3. **The obligations also include an obligation for compensation for loss or damage for death or injury to person (excluding the one set forth in the preceding item, i.e., bad faith tort).**
   - The query directly expresses this factor by mentioning "injury to the obligor," which aligns with obligations for compensation due to injury.

4. **An exception applies if the obligee acquires a claim corresponding to the relevant obligation from another person.**
   - The query does not explicitly mention or consider this exception, thus it does not express this factor directly.

Given these assessments:
- (query entails 1) because it involves an obligor attempting a set-off.
- (query entails 3) as it specifically mentions injury.
- The query indirectly touches upon the concept of obligations for harm caused but doesn't explicitly mention bad faith, so its relation to factor 2 is indirect at best.
- It does not entail factor 4 since it does not consider the exception regarding claim acquisition.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given that the query outlines a scenario where a person (who has an obligation for compensation due to injury) attempts to assert a set-off, and based on Article 509, such an attempt would generally not be allowed without an exception, we can infer that the defendant (or in this context, the obligor attempting the set-off) is indeed obligated according to the terms of Article 509.

Thus, the query suggests the defendant is obligated under these specific circumstances, which aligns with the logical outcome from Task 1 and the assessments made in Task 2.

Therefore, **pledged(1)**.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To break down Article 97 into its constituent factors for determining the effectiveness and implications of a manifestation of intention in legal contexts:

1. **A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party.** 
   - This indicates that the timing of when the other party receives the notice is crucial for the manifestation to be considered effective.

2. **The other party must receive notice of the manifestation of intention for it to be effective.**
   - The receipt of notice by the other party is a prerequisite for the manifestation of intention to have legal effect.

3. **If the other party prevents notice from reaching them without a legitimate reason, this prevention is a significant factor.**
   - The act of preventing notice without a valid reason can impact how the law views the effectiveness of the manifestation.

4. **The time at which the notice would have normally reached the other party is considered if they prevent it without a legitimate reason.**
   - This suggests that an assumed or projected timeline for receipt can be used in cases where interference occurs.

5. **The person making the manifestation of intention may die, lose mental capacity, or become subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after sending the notice.**
   - Post-manifestation changes in the sender's status (such as death, loss of mental capacity, or legal restrictions) are relevant factors.

6. **The effectiveness of a manifestation of intention is not impaired by certain events occurring after the notice has been sent.**
   - Specifically, events like the sender's death, loss of mental capacity, or imposition of legal restrictions do not negate the manifestation's effect.

Verdict: A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party, with considerations for prevention without legitimate reason and post-manifestation changes in the sender's status.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 97, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of these factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, only factor 1 is considered: "A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party." Since the notice has reached the other party, the manifestation of intention is effective, and thus the defendant is legally obligated.

2. (2, 3 | N)
Here, factors 2 and 3 are present: "The other party must receive notice of the manifestation of intention for it to be effective" and "If the other party prevents notice from reaching them without a legitimate reason, this prevention is a significant factor." However, if the other party prevents the notice without a legitimate reason, but no further action is taken (e.g., no assumed or projected timeline for receipt), then the defendant cannot be considered legally obligated due to the lack of effective notice.

3. (4 | Y)
Factor 4 states: "The time at which the notice would have normally reached the other party is considered if they prevent it without a legitimate reason." Given that this factor implies an assumed or projected timeline for receipt was used due to prevention, and assuming this scenario where such prevention occurred without a legitimate reason, the defendant can be considered legally obligated based on the effective time of notice.

4. (5 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 5 is considered: "The person making the manifestation of intention may die, lose mental capacity, or become subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after sending the notice." Since the change in status occurs after sending the notice and does not inherently negate the effectiveness of the manifestation (as per Article 97), but no other factors indicating receipt or prevention are present, we cannot determine an obligation solely based on this post-manifestation change.

5. (1, 6 | Y)
Here, factors 1 and 6 are present: "A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party" and "The effectiveness of a manifestation of intention is not impaired by certain events occurring after the notice has been sent." Given that the notice reached the other party (factor 1) and subsequent events do not impair its effectiveness (factor 6), the defendant is legally obligated.

6. (2, 4, 5 | Y)
In this final scenario, factors 2, 4, and 5 are considered: "The other party must receive notice of the manifestation of intention for it to be effective," "The time at which the notice would have normally reached the other party is considered if they prevent it without a legitimate reason," and "The person making the manifestation of intention may die, lose mental capacity, or become subject to restrictions on their legal capacity to act after sending the notice." Given that the notice's receipt is crucial (factor 2), an assumed timeline for receipt due to prevention without a legitimate reason applies (factor 4), and post-manifestation changes in the sender's status do not negate the manifestation's effect (factor 5), the defendant can be considered legally obligated based on the effective notice and the rules governing its impact despite subsequent events.

(2) At the request of a person as referred to in the main clause of Article 11
or the curator or curator's supervisor, the family court may decide that the person under curatorship must also obtain the consent of the curator before performing an act other than those set forth in each of the items of the preceding paragraph;provided, however, that this does not apply to an act provided for in the proviso to Article 9.
(3) If the curator does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent at the request of the person under curatorship.
(4) An act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.
Article 120
(1) An act that is voidable on the grounds of the qualified legal capacity to act of the person who did the act may be rescinded only by the person with qualified legal capacity (in the case of an act performed by the person as a legal representative of another person with limited capacity, including that other person with limited capacity), or an agent or successor thereof, or a person who has the authority to give consent thereto.
(2) An act that is voidable on the grounds of a mistake, fraud or duress may be rescinded only by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or an agent or successor thereof.

 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A person under curatorship must obtain the consent of the curator to perform certain acts, including receiving or using property producing civil fruit.
2. The consent of the curator is required for a person under curatorship to borrow money or guarantee an obligation.
3. A person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent to perform an act with the purpose of acquiring or losing any right regarding immovables or other significant property.
4. The curator's consent is necessary for a person under curatorship to sue any procedural act.
5. A person under curatorship requires the curator's consent to give a gift, reach a settlement, or enter into an arbitration agreement.
6. The consent of the curator is needed for a person under curatorship to accept or renounce a succession or divide an estate.
7. A person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent to refuse an offer of a gift, renounce a legacy, accept an offer of gift with burden, or accept a legacy with burden.
8. The curator's consent is required for a person under curatorship to construct a new building, renovate, expand, or undertake major repairs.
9. A person under curatorship needs the curator's consent to grant a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602.
10. The family court may decide that a person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent before performing an act other than those specified, at the request of certain individuals.
11. If the curator does not consent to an act, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent, if it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship.
12. An act is voidable if a person under curatorship performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it, on the grounds of qualified legal capacity to act.
13. A voidable act may be rescinded only by the person with qualified legal capacity, an agent or successor thereof, or a person who has the authority to give consent thereto.
14. A voidable act may also be rescinded by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or an agent or successor thereof, on the grounds of mistake, fraud, or duress.

Verdict: An act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.
Verdict: A voidable act may not be rescinded after the person prescribed in Article 120 ratifies it.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 14 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The defendant, a person under curatorship, received property producing civil fruit without obtaining the consent of the curator. According to factor 1, this act requires the curator's consent, and since it was not obtained, the defendant is legally obligated.

(2, 5 | Y)
Justification: The defendant borrowed money and gave a gift without obtaining the curator's consent. Factors 2 and 5 require the curator's consent for these acts, and since it was not obtained, the defendant is legally obligated.

(3, 9 | Y)
Justification: The defendant performed an act with the purpose of acquiring a right regarding immovables and granted a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602 without obtaining the curator's consent. Factors 3 and 9 require the curator's consent for these acts, and since it was not obtained, the defendant is legally obligated.

(4 | N)
Justification: The defendant sued a procedural act with the curator's consent. Factor 4 requires the curator's consent for this act, but since it was obtained, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(6, 8 | Y)
Justification: The defendant accepted a succession and constructed a new building without obtaining the curator's consent. Factors 6 and 8 require the curator's consent for these acts, and since it was not obtained, the defendant is legally obligated.

(7, 10 | Y)
Justification: The defendant refused an offer of a gift and the family court decided that they must obtain the curator's consent before performing another act without obtaining the curator's consent. Factors 7 and 10 require the curator's consent for these acts, and since it was not obtained, the defendant is legally obligated.

(11 | Y)
Justification: The curator did not consent to an act, but the family court granted permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent. However, this permission does not exempt the defendant from being legally obligated if they perform an act without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.

(12 | Y)
Justification: The defendant performed an act without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it, making the act voidable on the grounds of qualified legal capacity to act. According to factor 12, this makes the defendant legally obligated.

(13 | N)
Justification: The defendant is a person with qualified legal capacity who rescinded a voidable act. Factor 13 states that only this person or their agent or successor can rescind the act, so the defendant is not legally obligated in this scenario.

(14 | N)
Justification: The defendant ratified a voidable act after it was rescinded by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention. According to factor 14, ratifying the act means the defendant is not legally obligated.

(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The defendant received property producing civil fruit and sued a procedural act without obtaining the curator's consent for the first act. Factors 1 and 4 require the curator's consent for these acts, but since it was not obtained for the first act, the defendant is legally obligated.

(2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The defendant borrowed money and accepted a succession without obtaining the curator's consent. Factors 2 and 6 require the curator's consent for these acts, and since it was not obtained, the defendant is legally obligated.

(3, 7 | Y)
Justification: The defendant performed an act with the purpose of acquiring a right regarding immovables and refused an offer of a gift without obtaining the curator's consent. Factors 3 and 7 require the curator's consent for these acts, and since it was not obtained, the defendant is legally obligated.

(8, 10 | Y)
Justification: The defendant constructed a new building and the family court decided that they must obtain the curator's consent before performing another act without obtaining the curator's consent. Factors 8 and 10 require the curator's consent for these acts, and since it was not obtained, the defendant is legally obligated.

(5, 11 | Y)
Justification: The defendant gave a gift and the curator did not consent to an act, but the family court granted permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent. However, this permission does not exempt the defendant from being legally obligated if they perform an act without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it, such as giving a gift without consent.

article: Article 20
(1) After a person with qualified legal capacity who is involved in dealings with another party becomes a person with the legal capacity to act (meaning a person whose legal capacity to act is not subject to restrictions; the same applies hereinafter), the other party to those dealings may fix a period of one month or longer and demand that the person give a definite answer within that period of time as to whether the person will ratify an act that the person may rescind. In such a case, if the person fails to send a definite answer within that period of time, the person is deemed to have ratified that act.
(2) The second sentence of the preceding paragraph also applies if, before the person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act, the other party to dealings involving the person with qualified legal capacity lodges the demand prescribed in the preceding paragraph with the legal representative, curator, or assistant of that person with respect to an act within the scope of their authority, and they fail to send a definite answer within the fixed period of time referred to in that paragraph.
(3) If a person does not send notice within the period of time set forth in the preceding two paragraphs indicating that the person has completed any special formalities that an act requires, the person is deemed to have rescinded that act.
(4) The other party to dealings involving a person with qualified legal capacity may lodge a demand with a person under curatorship or with a person under assistance who is subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1) to demand that the person get the curator or assistant to ratify an act within the fixed period referred to in paragraph (1). In such a case, if the person under curatorship or person under assistance does not send notice within that period indicating that the person has gotten the curator or assistant to ratify the act in question, the person is deemed to have rescinded that act.
query: With respect to an act which may be rescinded on the grounds of the limited capacity, the person who is the counterparty to a person with limited capacity may, after such person with limited capacity has become a person with capacity, issue to such person a notice which demands, by establishing a certain period which is one month or more, that he/she should give a definite answer on whether or not such person will ratify such act which may be rescinded within such period.
In such case, if such person fails to send any definite answer within such period, he/she is deemed to have ratified such act.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 20, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list:

1. A person with qualified legal capacity is involved in dealings with another party.
2. The person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act, meaning their legal capacity to act is not subject to restrictions.
3. The other party to those dealings may fix a period of one month or longer.
4. The other party demands that the person give a definite answer within the fixed period as to whether they will ratify an act that they may rescind.
5. The demand is lodged with the person after they have become a person with the legal capacity to act.
6. Before the person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act, the other party lodges the demand with the legal representative, curator, or assistant of that person.
7. The demand is related to an act within the scope of the authority of the legal representative, curator, or assistant.
8. A fixed period of time is set for the person to respond to the demand.
9. The person fails to send a definite answer within the fixed period of time.
10. Special formalities are required for an act.
11. Notice is not sent within the period of time indicating that special formalities have been completed.
12. A person is under curatorship or under assistance and is subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1).
13. The other party lodges a demand with the person under curatorship or under assistance to get the curator or assistant to ratify an act within a fixed period.

Verdict: If the person fails to send a definite answer within the fixed period, they are deemed to have ratified the act.
Verdict: If notice is not sent within the period indicating that special formalities have been completed, the person is deemed to have rescinded the act.
Verdict: If the person under curatorship or under assistance does not send notice within the period indicating that they have gotten the curator or assistant to ratify the act, they are deemed to have rescinded the act.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 20, I will generate 13 unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors has occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: The defendant was involved in dealings with another party while having qualified legal capacity (factor 1), then became a person with full legal capacity to act (factor 2). The other party fixed a period of one month or longer (factor 3) and demanded a definite answer regarding ratifying an act that could be rescinded (factor 4). Given these conditions, if the defendant fails to respond within the specified time, they are deemed to have ratified the act, thus being legally obligated.

2. (5, 8, 9 | Y)
Justification: The demand was lodged with the person after they gained full legal capacity to act (factor 5), a fixed period of time was set for response (factor 8), and the defendant failed to send a definite answer within this time (factor 9). According to Article 20, such failure to respond results in the defendant being deemed to have ratified the act, making them legally obligated.

3. (6, 7 | N)
Justification: Before gaining full legal capacity, the other party lodged the demand with the defendant's legal representative, curator, or assistant (factor 6), and this demand was related to an act within their authority (factor 7). However, without additional factors indicating a failure to respond or complete special formalities, we cannot conclude the defendant is legally obligated based solely on these conditions.

4. (10, 11 | N)
Justification: Special formalities were required for the act (factor 10), and notice was not sent within the period indicating completion of these formalities (factor 11). According to Article 20, failure to send such notice results in the defendant being deemed to have rescinded the act. Thus, the defendant is not legally obligated.

5. (1, 12 | N)
Justification: The defendant was involved in dealings with another party while having qualified legal capacity (factor 1) and was under curatorship or assistance subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1) (factor 12). Without additional factors indicating a demand for ratification or failure to respond, the defendant's status alone does not determine legal obligation.

6. (3, 8 | N)
Justification: The other party fixed a period of one month or longer (factor 3), and a fixed period of time was set for the person to respond to the demand (factor 8). However, without factors indicating the defendant's capacity, involvement in dealings, or failure to respond, we cannot determine legal obligation.

7. (2, 9 | Y)
Justification: The defendant became a person with full legal capacity to act (factor 2), and they failed to send a definite answer within the fixed period of time (factor 9). Given the defendant's capacity to act and their failure to respond, it can be inferred that they would be deemed to have ratified the act, thus being legally obligated.

8. (4, 7 | N)
Justification: The other party demanded a definite answer regarding ratifying an act that could be rescinded (factor 4), and this demand was related to an act within the scope of authority of a legal representative, curator, or assistant (factor 7). Without factors indicating the defendant's response or failure to respond, we cannot conclude they are legally obligated.

9. (1, 5 | N)
Justification: The defendant was involved in dealings with another party while having qualified legal capacity (factor 1), and the demand was lodged with the person after they gained full legal capacity to act (factor 5). Without additional factors indicating a fixed period for response or failure to respond, we cannot determine legal obligation.

10. (6, 9 | Y)
Justification: Before gaining full legal capacity, the other party lodged the demand with the defendant's legal representative, curator, or assistant (factor 6), and the defendant (through their representative) failed to send a definite answer within the fixed period of time (factor 9). According to Article 20, such failure results in the defendant being deemed to have ratified the act, thus they are legally obligated.

11. (10, 13 | N)
Justification: Special formalities were required for the act (factor 10), and the other party lodged a demand with the person under curatorship or assistance to get the curator or assistant to ratify an act within a fixed period (factor 13). Without indicating failure to complete these formalities or respond, we cannot conclude the defendant is legally obligated.

12. (2, 3 | N)
Justification: The defendant became a person with full legal capacity to act (factor 2), and the other party fixed a period of one month or longer for response (factor 3). Without factors indicating a demand was made or how the defendant responded, we cannot determine legal obligation.

13. (12, 13 | N)
Justification: The defendant was under curatorship or assistance subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1) (factor 12), and the other party demanded the curator or assistant ratify an act within a fixed period (factor 13). Without factors indicating failure to respond or complete special formalities, we cannot conclude the defendant is legally obligated based on these conditions alone.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is subject to extinctive prescription.
2. The term "three years" in Article 724 is deemed to be replaced with "five years" for the purpose of applying the provisions regarding the extinctive prescription of the claim for compensation for loss or damage for death or injury to person caused by tort.
3. The right to claim compensation for loss or damage must be exercised within a certain time period from the time when the victim or legal representative comes to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator.
4. The time period for exercising the right to claim compensation is three years, as stated in Article 724, but is replaced with five years for claims related to death or injury to person caused by tort.
5. Alternatively, the right to claim compensation must be exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act.
6. The victim or legal representative must come to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator to start the time period for exercising the right to claim compensation.

Verdict: The claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription if the right is not exercised within the specified time period, either five years from the time when the victim or legal representative comes to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator (for claims related to death or injury to person) or 20 years from the time of the tortious act.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate six legal case scenarios, each using a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: Factor 1 alone only states that the claim for compensation is subject to extinctive prescription, but it does not provide any specific conditions or time frames for exercising the right. Without additional information, we cannot determine whether the defendant is obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Factors 2 and 3 together indicate that the term "three years" is replaced with "five years" for claims related to death or injury to person caused by tort, and the right must be exercised within a certain time period from when the victim or legal representative comes to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator. Since the replacement of "three years" with "five years" specifically applies to these types of claims, it implies that the defendant is obligated if the claim falls within this category.

(4, 6 | Y)
Justification: Factors 4 and 6 together state that the time period for exercising the right to claim compensation is five years for claims related to death or injury to person caused by tort, and the victim or legal representative must come to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator to start this time period. If these conditions are met, it is likely that the defendant is obligated to provide compensation.

(5 | N)
Justification: Factor 5 alone states that the right to claim compensation must be exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act. However, without knowing when the victim or legal representative came to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator, we cannot determine whether the defendant is obligated.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Factors 1 and 2 together indicate that the claim for compensation is subject to extinctive prescription, and the term "three years" is replaced with "five years" for claims related to death or injury to person caused by tort. This suggests that the defendant is obligated if the claim falls within this category, as the replacement of "three years" with "five years" implies a specific time frame for exercising the right.

(3, 5 | N)
Justification: Factors 3 and 5 together state that the right to claim compensation must be exercised within a certain time period from when the victim or legal representative comes to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator, and alternatively, within 20 years from the time of the tortious act. However, since these factors provide two separate time frames without specifying which one applies, we cannot determine whether the defendant is obligated without additional information.

Each case scenario yields a clear verdict based on the occurrence of the specified factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "The claim for compensation for loss or damage for death or injury to person caused by tort is not extinguished by prescription." According to Article 724-2, the term "three years" in Article 724 is replaced with "five years" for claims related to death or injury to person caused by tort. This means such claims are subject to a five-year prescription period from when the victim or legal representative knows the damage and the perpetrator's identity, or a 20-year period from the tortious act. Therefore, it is possible for these claims to be extinguished by prescription if not exercised within the specified time frames. Thus, the query is False.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is subject to extinctive prescription.**
   - (query entails 1) because it directly mentions that the claim for compensation for loss or damage for death or injury to person caused by tort "is not extinguished by prescription," implying awareness of prescription as a factor.

2. **The term "three years" in Article 724 is deemed to be replaced with "five years" for the purpose of applying the provisions regarding the extinctive prescription of the claim for compensation for loss or damage for death or injury to person caused by tort.**
   - (query entails 2) because, although it doesn't explicitly mention the time frame replacement, it specifies claims related to death or injury, which is the context where this replacement applies.

3. **The right to claim compensation for loss or damage must be exercised within a certain time period from the time when the victim or legal representative comes to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator.**
   - (query entails 3) because it implies an understanding that claims can be extinguished by prescription, which is directly related to the timing of exercising the right.

4. **The time period for exercising the right to claim compensation is three years, as stated in Article 724, but is replaced with five years for claims related to death or injury to person caused by tort.**
   - (query entails 4) since it discusses claims for death or injury to person, where the five-year replacement applies.

5. **Alternatively, the right to claim compensation must be exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act.**
   - (query does not entail 5) because it doesn't mention this alternative time frame explicitly.

6. **The victim or legal representative must come to know the damage and the identity of the perpetrator to start the time period for exercising the right to claim compensation.**
   - (query entails 6) as it implies awareness that claims can be extinguished, which requires knowledge of damage and perpetrator.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming the query is False because it incorrectly states that such claims are not extinguished by prescription when, in fact, they can be if not exercised within the specified time frames.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context and the tasks analyzed, the query does not directly address the defendant's obligations but rather discusses the prescription of claims related to tort. Therefore, it does not inherently determine the defendant obligated or not based on the information provided.

- **pledged(0)** because the query focuses on the extinguishment of claims by prescription rather than determining any obligation on the part of the defendant.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze Article 6 according to the instructions provided, let's break down the text into key phrases or sentences that represent factors used in determining verdicts in cases applying this article.

1. **A minor is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business** - This establishes a condition under which a minor can be treated as having the capacity to act similar to an adult.
2. **The permission allows the minor to have the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned** - This clarifies the extent of the capacity granted to the minor based on the permission received.
3. **There are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business** - This introduces a condition under which the initial permission can be revoked or limited, highlighting potential for change in the minor's capacity based on their ability to manage the business.
4. **The legal representative may revoke or limit the permission** - This identifies who has the authority to take action regarding the minor's business permission when there are grounds indicating the minor cannot sustain the business.
5. **Revocation or limitation is in accordance with the provisions of Part IV (Relatives)** - This specifies that any actions taken by the legal representative must adhere to specific regulatory guidelines found in another part of the law.

Verdict: A minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned, unless there are grounds indicating the minor cannot sustain the business, in which case the legal representative may revoke or limit the permission according to Part IV (Relatives).
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the factors of Article 6, we'll create combinations that uniquely represent different situations. Given there are 5 factors, we aim to create scenarios that cover various permutations without repeating any combination.

1. **Case Scenario with Factor 1**: 
(1 | N)
Justification: The minor being permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business (Factor 1) alone does not imply an obligation since it's a condition rather than an action or outcome that would incur liability.

2. **Case Scenario with Factors 1, 2**:
(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: If a minor is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business (Factor 1) and this permission allows the minor to have the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned (Factor 2), then the defendant (assuming the minor or their representative) would be legally obligated to adhere to the responsibilities associated with conducting that business.

3. **Case Scenario with Factors 2, 3**:
(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The combination of the minor having adult-like capacity in the permitted business (Factor 2) and there being grounds indicating they cannot sustain it (Factor 3) suggests a scenario where obligations may arise from the initial permission and the subsequent need to address the minor's inability to manage. This could involve legal obligations related to rectifying or adjusting the business operations.

4. **Case Scenario with Factors 1, 4**:
(1, 4 | N)
Justification: If a minor is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business (Factor 1) and the legal representative may revoke or limit the permission (Factor 4), without evidence that the minor cannot sustain the business or any wrongdoing, it doesn't inherently imply an obligation on the part of the defendant. The action of revocation or limitation itself does not necessarily incur liability.

5. **Case Scenario with Factors 3, 5**:
(3, 5 | Y)
Justification: When there are grounds indicating the minor cannot sustain the business (Factor 3) and any revocation or limitation is in accordance with the provisions of Part IV (Relatives) (Factor 5), it suggests a scenario where legal obligations are clear. The defendant would be obligated to follow the regulatory guidelines for adjusting the minor's business permissions, ensuring compliance with the law.

6. **Case Scenario with Factors 2, 4, 5**:
(2, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: This combination involves the minor having adult-like capacity in the business (Factor 2), the legal representative having the power to revoke or limit permission (Factor 4), and this action being governed by Part IV (Relatives) (Factor 5). It implies a structured scenario where obligations are defined, both in terms of business conduct and regulatory compliance, suggesting that the defendant is indeed legally obligated.

7. **Case Scenario with Factors 1, 3**:
(1, 3 | N)
Justification: The permission for a minor to conduct business (Factor 1) combined with grounds indicating they cannot sustain it (Factor 3) doesn't directly imply an obligation without considering the actions taken by the legal representative or the specifics of the regulatory framework.

8. **Case Scenario with Factors 1, 2, 3**:
(1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This scenario combines permission for business (Factor 1), adult-like capacity in that business (Factor 2), and grounds for inability to sustain it (Factor 3). It presents a comprehensive situation where the defendant would likely be obligated to address the minor's business situation, possibly through revocation or limitation of permissions.

9. **Case Scenario with Factors 4, 5**:
(4, 5 | N)
Justification: The legal representative's ability to revoke or limit permission (Factor 4) and the requirement for this action to follow Part IV (Relatives) (Factor 5), without other contextual factors, does not inherently imply an obligation on the defendant. These factors relate more to the process of adjustment rather than the establishment of liability.

10. **Case Scenario with Factors 1, 2, 4**:
(1, 2, 4 | Y)
Justification: This combination involves permission for business (Factor 1), adult-like capacity (Factor 2), and the legal representative's power to revoke or limit (Factor 4). It suggests a scenario where obligations could arise from both the conduct of the business and the potential need for adjustment by the legal representative.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to different determinations of obligation based on Article 6.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 338, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list:

* The effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables must be preserved.
* Budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same.
* Registration of budgeted expenses is a prerequisite for the existence of a statutory lien.
* The construction work has a budgeted amount that serves as a reference point.
* Expenses of the construction work can exceed the budgeted amount.
* A statutory lien is affected by the excess amount of expenses over the budgeted amount.

Verdict: If the expenses of the construction work exceed the budgeted amount, a statutory lien does not exist with respect to the amount in excess of the same.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 338, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables must be preserved (factor 1), and the budgeted expenses of the construction work have been registered prior to commencement (factor 2). Given that these conditions are met, it is likely that a statutory lien exists, making the defendant legally obligated. The registration of budgeted expenses prior to commencement indicates an intention to create a lien, and preserving the effectiveness of such liens suggests that the legal framework supports this obligation.

2. (3, 4 | Y)
Here, the registration of budgeted expenses is a prerequisite for the existence of a statutory lien (factor 3), and there is a budgeted amount serving as a reference point for the construction work (factor 4). Since the registration is a prerequisite and there's a clear budgeted amount, this implies that the parties involved have taken steps to establish a basis for a statutory lien. Therefore, the defendant would be legally obligated, as the conditions for a lien's existence have been met.

3. (1, 5 | N)
In this scenario, the effectiveness of statutory liens must be preserved (factor 1), but the expenses of the construction work exceed the budgeted amount (factor 5). The excess in expenses could indicate that the original basis for the lien (the budgeted amount) is no longer applicable or has been superseded by new financial realities. Given this, and without explicit mention of registration or a clear link to the statutory framework, it's reasonable to conclude that the defendant might not be obligated due to the changed circumstances.

4. (2, 6 | N)
This case involves the budgeted expenses being registered prior to commencement (factor 2), but a statutory lien is affected by the excess amount of expenses over the budgeted amount (factor 6). The impact on the statutory lien due to exceeded expenses suggests that the original terms under which the lien might have been considered are no longer fully applicable. Since the excess affects the lien, and without further clarification on how these excess costs are handled within the legal framework, it's plausible that the defendant is not obligated in this scenario.

5. (3, 5 | N)
Here, the registration of budgeted expenses is a prerequisite for the existence of a statutory lien (factor 3), and the expenses exceed the budgeted amount (factor 5). Given that the excess expenses might not have been accounted for in the initial registration, it's likely that these additional costs do not fall under the original lien. Therefore, without specific provisions addressing how such excesses are to be treated, the defendant would likely not be obligated regarding the excess amounts.

6. (4, 6 | N)
In this final scenario, there is a budgeted amount for the construction work (factor 4), and a statutory lien does not exist with respect to the amount in excess of the budgeted expenses (factor 6). The clear stipulation that the lien does not cover excess amounts directly implies that the defendant's obligations are limited to the originally budgeted amount. Thus, for any expenses exceeding this budget, the defendant would not be legally obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states, "In order to preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables, the budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same." This statement aligns directly with Article 338, which explicitly requires the registration of budgeted expenses before starting the construction work to maintain the effectiveness of statutory liens. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 338, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

Given the factors:
1. The effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables must be preserved.
2. Budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same.
3. Registration of budgeted expenses is a prerequisite for the existence of a statutory lien.
4. The construction work has a budgeted amount that serves as a reference point.
5. Expenses of the construction work can exceed the budgeted amount.
6. A statutory lien is affected by the excess amount of expenses over the budgeted amount.

Justification:
- **Factor 1**: The query directly mentions preserving the effectiveness of statutory liens, so (query entails Factor 1).
- **Factor 2**: The query explicitly states that budgeted expenses must be registered prior to commencement, so (query entails Factor 2).
- **Factor 3**: While the query implies registration is necessary for effectiveness, it does not directly state this as a prerequisite for the existence of a statutory lien, but given the context and requirement for registration, we can infer alignment with the factor's intent, thus (query entails Factor 3) by implication.
- **Factor 4**: The query mentions budgeted expenses, implying there is a budgeted amount, so (query entails Factor 4).
- **Factor 5 & Factor 6**: These factors are about exceeding the budget and its effect on statutory liens. The query does not directly address what happens if expenses exceed the budget or how this affects the lien, so it does not entail Factors 5 and 6.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 in that they support the truth of the query based on Article 338 but highlight specific aspects covered by the query.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query focuses on a procedural requirement (registration of budgeted expenses) for preserving the effectiveness of statutory liens rather than directly stating an obligation that would result in liability or an affirmative action required from a defendant. Therefore, it does not explicitly determine the defendant obligated based on the information provided, which leads to **pledged(0)**.

In summary:
- The query is True.
- (query entails Factor 1), (query entails Factor 2), (query entails Factor 3) by implication, and (query entails Factor 4).
- pledged(0).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 482, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

1. A person has the right to perform an obligation (referred to as a "performer").
2. The performer concludes a contract with the obligee.
3. The contract is to the effect that the person is to have the obligation extinguished by making another type of payment or delivery.
4. The alternative payment or delivery is made in lieu of the payment or delivery to be performed by the obligor.
5. The performer makes the other type of payment or delivery as agreed upon in the contract.

Verdict: The payment or delivery thus made has the same effect as that of the performance of the obligation.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the factors of Article 482, we will consider each factor's presence or absence in determining the legal obligation of the defendant. Given there are 5 factors, we aim to create unique combinations that adhere to the instructions.

1. **Case with Factor 1 only**: (1 | N)  
Justification: Having the right to perform an obligation does not inherently obligate someone without further action or agreement. Thus, merely being a performer (Factor 1) is insufficient for legal obligation under Article 482.

2. **Case with Factors 1 and 2**: (1, 2 | N)  
Justification: Even if a person has the right to perform an obligation and concludes a contract with the obligee (Factors 1 and 2), without specifying an alternative form of payment or delivery (Factor 3), there's no basis for determining an obligation under Article 482.

3. **Case with Factors 1, 2, and 3**: (1, 2, 3 | N)  
Justification: Although having the right to perform, concluding a contract, and specifying an alternative payment or delivery method are significant steps, without making the actual alternative payment or delivery (Factor 5), there's no fulfillment of the conditions set by Article 482 for obligation.

4. **Case with Factors 1, 2, 3, and 4**: (1, 2, 3, 4 | N)  
Justification: Even with all conditions met except the actual performance of the alternative payment or delivery (Factor 5), the defendant cannot be considered legally obligated. The agreement to make an alternative payment in lieu of the original (Factors 3 and 4) is crucial but not sufficient without execution.

5. **Case with Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5**: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)  
Justification: When all factors are present—having the right to perform, concluding a contract for an alternative payment or delivery method, specifying this method is in lieu of the original payment, and actually making the alternative payment or delivery—the conditions of Article 482 are fully met. Thus, the defendant's actions have the same effect as performing the original obligation, making them legally obligated.

To fulfill the requirement of generating a number of scenarios equal to the number of factors (5) without repeating combinations, we need to consider unique subsets for each scenario:

6. **Case with Factors 2 and 5**: (2, 5 | N)  
Justification: Concluding a contract and making an alternative payment or delivery are significant actions, but without the context of having the right to perform (Factor 1), specifying an alternative method (Factor 3), and it being in lieu of another payment (Factor 4), these actions alone do not establish a legal obligation under Article 482.

7. **Case with Factors 3 and 4**: (3, 4 | N)  
Justification: Specifying an alternative payment or delivery method and agreeing it's in lieu of the original are crucial elements, but without the right to perform, a contract with the obligee, or the actual performance of the alternative payment, these factors alone do not suffice for legal obligation.

8. **Case with Factors 1, 4, and 5**: (1, 4, 5 | Y)  
Justification: Having the right to perform, making an alternative payment in lieu of the original, and actually performing this alternative can be seen as fulfilling the core conditions of Article 482, assuming the contract's existence is implied or not necessary given these actions. This scenario might seem to obligate the defendant, but it's a stretch without Factor 2 (contract) explicitly mentioned.

9. **Case with Factors 2, 3, and 5**: (2, 3, 5 | Y)  
Justification: Concluding a contract for an alternative payment method, specifying this method, and making the payment could be seen as fulfilling the obligation, especially if having the right to perform is implied or not required given these explicit actions. However, strict interpretation might still require Factor 1.

10. **Case with Factors 1, 2, and 5**: (1, 2, 5 | Y)  
Justification: Having the right to perform, concluding a contract, and making the alternative payment or delivery could suffice for legal obligation under Article 482, especially if Factors 3 and 4 are implied within the contract's terms.

Given the instruction to generate scenarios equal to the number of factors (which is 5), but considering the need for diverse and unique combinations without repetition, the above analysis provides a comprehensive approach. However, to strictly adhere to the format and instructions:

- The critical realization is that Factors 1 through 5 collectively establish a clear path to obligation under Article 482.
- Unique combinations must be considered to explore all possible scenarios.

Thus, focusing on the requirement for unique combinations and the instruction clarity:

The final set of cases, adhering strictly to the format and focusing on the diversity of factor combinations without exceeding the necessary number of scenarios based on the factors provided, would emphasize the importance of each factor in determining legal obligation. Given this, a reevaluation towards providing a concise and directly relevant set of case scenarios is essential.

To align with the original instruction for generating case scenarios equal to the number of factors (5) but ensuring clarity and direct relevance:

1. **Case with Factor 1**: (1 | N)
2. **Case with Factors 1, 2**: (1, 2 | N)
3. **Case with Factors 1, 2, 3**: (1, 2, 3 | N)
4. **Case with Factors 1, 2, 3, 4**: (1, 2, 3, 4 | N)
5. **Case with Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)

This approach ensures that each scenario builds upon the previous, demonstrating how the addition of factors progressively leads to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation under Article 482.

 To address the tasks defined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that the obligee (B) may not perform the obligation which he/she contracts with a third party by assigning the claim which the obligor (A) contracts with the obligee (B) to the third party as a substitute against the will of the obligor (A). Article 482 discusses a scenario where a performer (who has the right to perform an obligation) concludes a contract with the obligee to extinguish the obligation by making another type of payment or delivery. This article does not directly address the assignment of claims or the substitution of obligations against the will of the obligor.

However, logically speaking, if a contract is made between the obligee and a third party (without the consent of the obligor) where the claim against the obligor is assigned as part of performing an obligation for the third party, it could be argued that such an action does not align with the principles outlined in Article 482. This article focuses on a mutually agreed-upon alternative performance between the performer and the obligee, which does not necessarily involve assigning claims to third parties without the original obligor's consent.

Given this understanding, the query seems to highlight a limitation or condition (the need for consent from the obligor) that isn't explicitly covered by Article 482. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, it might seem that the query is attempting to point out a scenario not directly supported by Article 482, suggesting it could be seen as True in the context of implying additional considerations beyond what Article 482 covers.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **A person has the right to perform an obligation (referred to as a "performer").**  
   The query does not directly mention a performer having the right to perform an obligation; it discusses assignment of claims and obligations between parties, including a third party. Therefore, (query entails 1) is False.

2. **The performer concludes a contract with the obligee.**  
   While the query mentions contracts, it focuses on the assignment of claims and contracts between the obligee and a third party, not specifically a performer concluding a contract with the obligee as described in Article 482. Thus, (query entails 2) is False.

3. **The contract is to the effect that the person is to have the obligation extinguished by making another type of payment or delivery.**  
   The query does not discuss alternative payments or deliveries for extinguishing obligations but rather the assignment of claims. Hence, (query entails 3) is False.

4. **The alternative payment or delivery is made in lieu of the payment or delivery to be performed by the obligor.**  
   This factor is also not directly addressed in the query, as it discusses claim assignments and substitutions against the will of the obligor, not alternative performances. Therefore, (query entails 4) is False.

5. **The performer makes the other type of payment or delivery as agreed upon in the contract.**  
   Since the query does not discuss a performer making an alternative payment or delivery based on a contract with the obligee, (query entails 5) is False.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query discusses scenarios where obligations and claims are assigned or substituted without the consent of all parties involved. It implies that such actions might not be valid against the will of the obligor but does not directly state an obligation for a defendant in a legal context. Therefore, it's more about the conditions under which obligations can be considered fulfilled or altered rather than explicitly stating a new obligation for a defendant.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze Article 481, let's break it down into key phrases or sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article:

1. **A third party obligor of a claim that has been attached** - This establishes the subject of the action, which is the third party obligor.
2. **Performs the obligation to that third party's own obligee** - This describes the action taken by the third party obligor, which is performing their obligation but to their original obligee rather than the attaching obligee.
3. **The attaching obligee is entitled to request the third party obligor to perform the obligation de novo** - This outlines a right granted to the attaching obligee under specific circumstances.
4. **To the extent of the damage sustained by the attaching obligee** - This limits the scope of the performance requested from the third party obligor, tying it directly to the damages experienced by the attaching obligee.
5. **The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not preclude the relevant third party obligor from exercising the right to reimbursement from the obligee** - This clarifies that the rights granted under the article do not eliminate other potential rights or remedies available to the third party obligor.

Verdict: If a third party obligor performs their obligation to their own obligee after an attachment, the attaching obligee can request performance de novo to cover their damages, without precluding the third party's right to seek reimbursement.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 481, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique combination of factors.

1. (1, 2 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factors 1 and 2 are present, meaning there is a third party obligor of a claim that has been attached, and they perform the obligation to their own obligee. However, without factor 3, which grants the attaching obligee the right to request performance de novo, the defendant (third party obligor) does not have a legal obligation to perform the obligation again solely based on these factors.

2. (1, 3 | N)
Justification: Here, factors 1 and 3 are present. There is a third party obligor of an attached claim, and the attaching obligee has the right to request performance de novo. However, without factor 2 indicating that the obligation was performed to the original obligee, it's unclear if the basis for requesting de novo performance exists. Thus, the defendant cannot be deemed legally obligated based solely on these factors.

3. (1, 4 | N)
Justification: In this case, factors 1 and 4 are present. There is a third party obligor of an attached claim, and any performance requested would be limited to the extent of the damage sustained by the attaching obligee. Without factor 2 (performance to the original obligee) or factor 3 (right to request de novo performance), there's no clear legal basis for obligating the defendant to perform.

4. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Factors 2 and 3 are present here. The third party obligor performed their obligation to their own obligee, and the attaching obligee has the right to request de novo performance. Given these factors, especially with factor 3 explicitly granting a right to the attaching obligee, it can be argued that the defendant (third party obligor) is legally obligated to perform the obligation again to address the attaching obligee's concerns.

5. (1, 2, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this comprehensive scenario, all factors are present except for factor 3 standing alone. There is a third party obligor of an attached claim (factor 1), they performed their obligation to their original obligee (factor 2), any requested performance would be limited to the extent of the damage sustained by the attaching obligee (factor 4), and the provisions do not preclude reimbursement rights (factor 5). Although factor 3 is crucial for determining the right to request de novo performance, when combined with factor 1 (establishing the subject) and factors 2 and 4 (which provide context for the action and its limitation), and considering factor 5 does not negate but rather complements the rights under discussion, it suggests a scenario where the defendant could be seen as obligated due to the comprehensive nature of the situation described. However, this interpretation stretches the direct application of factors without explicitly including the right to request de novo performance (factor 3). Therefore, the inclusion of all these factors might still imply an obligation due to the detailed context provided for the action and its repercussions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 246, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A person (referred to as "processor") adds labor to another person's movables.
2. The processor adds labor to another person's materials.
3. The value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the material.
4. The processor provides a portion of the materials.
5. The value of provided materials added to the value derived from the labor is calculated.
6. The value of the other person's materials is considered.

Verdict: If the value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the material, the processor acquires ownership of the processed thing.
Verdict: If the processor provides a portion of the materials, the processor acquires ownership of the processed thing only if the value of provided materials added to the value derived from the labor exceeds the value of the other person's materials.
Verdict: Otherwise, the ownership of the processed thing belongs to the owner of the material.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 246, I will generate six legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs, where a person (processor) adds labor to another person's movables. Since there is no information about the value derived from the work or the provision of materials by the processor, the default rule applies, and the ownership of the processed thing belongs to the owner of the material. Therefore, the defendant (processor) is not obligated.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 2 occurs, where the processor adds labor to another person's materials. Similar to case 1, there is no information about the value derived from the work or the provision of materials by the processor. The default rule applies, and the ownership of the processed thing belongs to the owner of the material. Therefore, the defendant (processor) is not obligated.

(3 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 3 occurs, where the value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the material. According to Article 246, if this condition is met, the processor acquires ownership of the processed thing. Therefore, the defendant (processor) is obligated.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 and 4 occur, where a person (processor) adds labor to another person's movables, and the processor provides a portion of the materials. However, there is no information about the value derived from the work or whether the value of provided materials added to the value derived from the labor exceeds the value of the other person's materials. The default rule applies, and the ownership of the processed thing belongs to the owner of the material. Therefore, the defendant (processor) is not obligated.

(2, 5 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2 and 5 occur, where the processor adds labor to another person's materials, and the value of provided materials added to the value derived from the labor is calculated. However, there is no information about whether this calculated value exceeds the value of the other person's materials. Without this crucial information, the default rule applies, and the ownership of the processed thing belongs to the owner of the material. Therefore, the defendant (processor) is not obligated.

(3, 4, 6 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 3, 4, and 6 occur, where the value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the material, the processor provides a portion of the materials, and the value of the other person's materials is considered. According to Article 246, if the value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the material, the processor acquires ownership of the processed thing. Additionally, since the processor provides a portion of the materials, and the calculated value (factor 5) is implied to exceed the value of the other person's materials (factor 6), the defendant (processor) is obligated.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given Article 246 and the scenario where a processor uses only another's woods as materials and contributes work to them, the query states that the processor shall acquire ownership of the thing when the value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the materials. According to Article 246(1), this statement aligns with the provision that if the value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the material, the processor acquires ownership of the processed thing.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 246, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A person (referred to as "processor") adds labor to another person's movables.**
   - The query entails this factor because it mentions a processor contributing work to another's materials, which aligns with adding labor to another person's movables.
   - (query entails 1)

2. **The processor adds labor to another person's materials.**
   - This is directly mentioned in the query as using "only other's woods as materials and contributes work to them."
   - (query entails 2)

3. **The value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the material.**
   - The query specifically states this condition for the processor to acquire ownership.
   - (query entails 3)

4. **The processor provides a portion of the materials.**
   - The query does not mention the processor providing any materials; it states the processor uses "only other's woods as materials."
   - (query does not entail 4)

5. **The value of provided materials added to the value derived from the labor is calculated.**
   - Since the query specifies that the processor uses only another's materials, this factor about calculating the value of provided materials is not directly applicable.
   - However, it implies a calculation regarding the value derived from work versus material value, but does not explicitly mention adding any value from materials provided by the processor since none are mentioned.
   - (query does not entail 5)

6. **The value of the other person's materials is considered.**
   - The query mentions the value of the materials in relation to the value derived from the work, indicating that the value of the other person's materials is indeed a consideration.
   - (query entails 6)

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query discusses conditions under which the processor acquires ownership, implying obligations or rights regarding property. However, it does not explicitly state any obligation on the part of a "defendant" in a legal sense but rather outlines a scenario for ownership determination based on Article 246.

Given the context provided, if we interpret "determine the defendant obligated" as whether the query imposes or implies any obligations (such as acquiring ownership under certain conditions), then:

- **pledged(1)** because the query does imply that under specific conditions (value of work significantly exceeding material value), the processor has a right or obligation regarding the acquisition of ownership.

However, without explicit legal context regarding a "defendant" and their obligations in this scenario, this interpretation leans towards the implications of Article 246 on property rights rather than traditional notions of legal obligation or liability.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: If the holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained, and the holder may have the owner reimburse the same if necessary expenses are incurred, then the defendant is obligated to reimburse the necessary expenses.

(4, 5 | N)
Justification: Although the holder of a right of retention may incur beneficial expenses with respect to the thing retained, and there must be currently an increase in value as a result of the beneficial expenses incurred, there is no obligation to reimburse without the owner's choice or court intervention.

(6 | Y)
Justification: The owner has a choice to reimburse either the expenses incurred or the increase in value for beneficial expenses, which implies that the defendant is obligated to accept reimbursement according to the owner's choice.

(2, 4 | N)
Justification: If the holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained, and the holder may also incur beneficial expenses, there is no clear obligation to reimburse without considering the owner's choice or court intervention.

Justification: If the holder may have the owner reimburse the same if necessary expenses are incurred, and the court may grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement of the same at the request of the owner, then the defendant is obligated to reimburse the necessary expenses within a reasonable timeframe.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: Given that the provisions of Articles 296 through 300 and those of Article 304 apply mutatis mutandis to pledges, and there must be currently an increase in value as a result of the beneficial expenses incurred, the defendant is obligated to adhere to these provisions and consider reimbursement for the increased value.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that even if a pledgee of movables paid necessary expenses for the thing pledged, the pledgee may not demand reimbursement for the necessary expenses to the possessor. However, according to Article 299(1), "If the holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained, that holder may have the owner reimburse the same." This directly contradicts the query's statement, as it explicitly allows the pledgee (or the holder of a right of retention) to demand reimbursement for necessary expenses from the owner. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 299(1), the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The provisions of Articles 296 through 300 and those of Article 304 apply mutatis mutandis to pledges.**
   - (query does not entail 1) The query does not mention or consider the applicability of these articles to pledges, so it does not express this factor.

2. **If the holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained,**
   - (query entails 2) The query directly mentions the pledgee paying necessary expenses for the thing pledged, which aligns with this scenario.

3. **the holder may have the owner reimburse the same if necessary expenses are incurred.**
   - (query does not entail 3) The query actually contradicts this by stating that the pledgee may not demand reimbursement, despite incurring necessary expenses.

4. **The holder of a right of retention may incur beneficial expenses with respect to the thing retained.**
   - (query does not entail 4) The query only mentions necessary expenses and does not consider or mention beneficial expenses.

5. **There must be currently an increase in value as a result of the beneficial expenses incurred.**
   - (query does not entail 5) Since the query does not discuss beneficial expenses, it also does not address the potential increase in value from such expenses.

6. **The owner has a choice to reimburse either the expenses incurred or the increase in value for beneficial expenses.**
   - (query does not entail 6) The query focuses on necessary expenses and does not delve into the reimbursement options related to beneficial expenses.

7. **The court may grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement of the same at the request of the owner.**
   - (query does not entail 7) This factor is about the court's discretion in granting time for reimbursement, which is not addressed or considered in the query.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is False because it contradicts specific provisions outlined in the articles, particularly regarding the reimbursement of necessary expenses.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the information and analysis, the query suggests that the pledgee (who could be considered the defendant in a scenario where they are seeking reimbursement) may not demand reimbursement for necessary expenses. However, according to Article 299(1), the holder of a right of retention (or pledgee) is entitled to have the owner reimburse necessary expenses incurred. Therefore, based on the actual legal provision, the defendant (pledgee) would be obligated to be reimbursed if they incurred necessary expenses, but the query incorrectly states that they may not demand reimbursement.

So, in terms of determining obligation based on the query's statement (and considering it's about the possibility of demanding reimbursement), the query itself suggests a lack of obligation for the owner to reimburse. However, this interpretation is contrary to the actual legal provision which supports the pledgee's right to reimbursement. Thus, following the instruction format but correcting for the context provided:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 460, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* The guarantor has given a guarantee as requested by the principal obligor.
* The principal obligor is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding.
* The obligee does not participate in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate.
* The obligation is due.
* No extension of time granted by the obligee to the principal obligor after the conclusion of the guarantee contract may be duly asserted against the guarantor.
* The guarantor is, without negligence, rendered a judicial decision ordering the guarantor to perform the obligation to the obligee.

Verdict: The guarantor may exercise in advance the right to reimbursement against the principal obligor if the above conditions are met.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors provided from Article 460, I will generate six legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only the first factor is present, meaning "The guarantor has given a guarantee as requested by the principal obligor." This condition alone does not meet the requirements for the guarantor to exercise the right to reimbursement against the principal obligor, as additional conditions such as the obligation being due or the principal obligor facing bankruptcy proceedings are necessary.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Here, the second and third factors are present: "The principal obligor is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding" and "The obligee does not participate in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate." Although these conditions relate to the financial situation of the principal obligor, they do not independently satisfy the criteria for the guarantor to seek reimbursement, particularly without the obligation being due or a judicial decision against the guarantor.

(4 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the fourth factor is present: "The obligation is due." While having the obligation due is a critical component, it alone does not allow the guarantor to exercise the right to reimbursement. Other factors such as the principal obligor's bankruptcy status or a judicial decision against the guarantor are required in conjunction.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: This scenario includes the first and fourth factors: "The guarantor has given a guarantee as requested by the principal obligor" and "The obligation is due." Although these conditions are essential, they do not collectively meet the criteria outlined in Article 460 for the guarantor to seek reimbursement in advance without considering the principal obligor's financial status or a judicial ruling.

(5 | N)
Justification: Here, only the fifth factor is considered: "No extension of time granted by the obligee to the principal obligor after the conclusion of the guarantee contract may be duly asserted against the guarantor." This condition, by itself, does not provide sufficient grounds for the guarantor to claim reimbursement, as it primarily addresses the relationship between the obligee and the principal obligor regarding payment extensions.

(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | Y)
Justification: In this comprehensive scenario, all factors are present: "The principal obligor is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding," "The obligee does not participate in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate," "The obligation is due," "No extension of time granted by the obligee to the principal obligor after the conclusion of the guarantee contract may be duly asserted against the guarantor," and "The guarantor is, without negligence, rendered a judicial decision ordering the guarantor to perform the obligation to the obligee." Given that all necessary conditions are met, including the critical elements of bankruptcy proceedings, the due obligation, protection against payment extensions, and a judicial ruling, the guarantor has sufficient grounds to exercise the right to reimbursement against the principal obligor.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that when the principal obligation has fallen due, a person who made a guarantee after receiving consignment of the principal obligor may exercise the right to obtain reimbursement vis-a-vis the principal obligor even before making his/her own payment.

According to Article 460, for a guarantor to exercise in advance the right to reimbursement against the principal obligor, certain conditions must be met, including that the obligation is due. The query specifically mentions that the principal obligation has fallen due, which aligns with one of the conditions stated in Article 460 (condition ii: "the obligation is due").

However, the article also outlines other specific scenarios under which a guarantor may seek reimbursement in advance, such as the principal obligor being subject to bankruptcy proceedings and the guarantor being ordered by a judicial decision to perform the obligation without negligence. The query does not explicitly mention these conditions but focuses on the due date of the obligation.

Given this analysis, the query seems to be partially aligned with Article 460, particularly concerning the condition that the obligation is due. However, it doesn't fully capture all scenarios under which a guarantor may seek reimbursement in advance as outlined by Article 460.

**Logical Conclusion for Task 1:** Based on the information given and focusing strictly on the condition of the obligation being due, one might argue the query has some basis in truth but does not fully represent all conditions under which a guarantor can exercise the right to reimbursement. Thus, it could be seen as partially true but requires additional context for a complete assessment.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The guarantor has given a guarantee as requested by the principal obligor.**
   - The query mentions that the person made a guarantee after receiving consignment of the principal obligor, which implies this condition is considered.

   (query entails factor 1)

2. **The principal obligor is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding.**
   - This condition is not mentioned in the query.

   (query does not entail factor 2)

3. **The obligee does not participate in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate.**
   - Similar to factor 2, this condition is not addressed in the query.

   (query does not entail factor 3)

4. **The obligation is due.**
   - The query explicitly states that the principal obligation has fallen due.

   (query entails factor 4)

5. **No extension of time granted by the obligee to the principal obligor after the conclusion of the guarantee contract may be duly asserted against the guarantor.**
   - This condition is not discussed in the query.

   (query does not entail factor 5)

6. **The guarantor is, without negligence, rendered a judicial decision ordering the guarantor to perform the obligation to the obligee.**
   - The query does not mention anything about a judicial decision or negligence.

   (query does not entail factor 6)

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query implies that under certain conditions (when the principal obligation has fallen due), the guarantor may seek reimbursement from the principal obligor. However, it does not directly state that the defendant (assumed to be the principal obligor in this context) is obligated to provide reimbursement without considering other factors such as bankruptcy proceedings or judicial decisions.

Given this analysis, the query suggests a scenario where the defendant could be considered obligated under specific conditions but does not definitively determine the defendant's obligation without additional context.

**Representation for Task 3:** pledged(0), as the query does not conclusively determine the defendant's obligation across all possible scenarios outlined in Article 460.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying these articles. Here is the list of factors:

1. A landowner has the right to install boundary markers on their property.
2. The expenses of installing boundary markers are shared with the owner of the neighboring land.
3. The expenses of installation and preservation of boundary markers are borne equally by neighbors.
4. Measuring expenses are borne in proportion to the area of each land, as an exception to equal sharing of expenses.
5. Boundary markers, fences, walls, channels, and moats installed on boundary lines are subject to a presumption of co-ownership.
6. Neighboring landowners are presumed to be co-owners of boundary markers, fences, walls, channels, and moats installed on their shared boundary.

Verdict: The expenses of installation and preservation of boundary markers are borne equally by neighbors, except for measuring expenses which are borne proportionally to the area of each land, and boundary features are presumed to be co-owned.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the provided factors from Article 223, Article 224, and Article 229, we will create six different scenarios, each using a unique combination of the factors. The goal is to determine whether the defendant is legally obligated (Y) or not (N) in each scenario.

### Case Scenario 1: Installation Right and Shared Expenses
(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the landowner has the right to install boundary markers on their property (Factor 1), and the expenses of installing these markers are shared with the neighboring landowner (Factor 2). Given that there's an acknowledged right and a shared financial responsibility, it's reasonable to conclude that the defendant is legally obligated to contribute to these expenses.

### Case Scenario 2: Equal Expense Sharing and Measuring Expenses
(3, 4 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves the principles that the expenses for installation and preservation of boundary markers are borne equally by neighbors (Factor 3), with an exception for measuring expenses which are proportionate to the land area (Factor 4). Since both factors directly relate to financial obligations regarding boundary marker maintenance, it indicates a clear legal obligation on the part of the defendant to share these costs.

### Case Scenario 3: Co-ownership Presumption and Neighboring Landowners
(5, 6 | Y)
Justification: When boundary markers, fences, walls, channels, and moats are installed on boundary lines, there's a presumption of co-ownership (Factor 5), and neighboring landowners are presumed to be co-owners of these installations (Factor 6). This shared ownership implies shared responsibilities and expenses, thus the defendant is legally obligated in this scenario.

### Case Scenario 4: Installation Right and Co-ownership
(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: A landowner's right to install boundary markers (Factor 1) combined with the presumption of co-ownership of such markers (Factor 5) suggests that while the defendant has the autonomy to decide on installations, they are also bound by the shared ownership principle. This implies a legal obligation to respect and potentially contribute to the maintenance of these markers.

### Case Scenario 5: Shared Expenses and Measuring Expenses
(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the expenses of installing boundary markers are shared (Factor 2), and measuring expenses are borne in proportion to each land's area (Factor 4). The presence of both factors clearly indicates a financial obligation on the defendant's part, as they must contribute to both types of expenses according to the specified terms.

### Case Scenario 6: Equal Expense Sharing and Installation Right
(3, 1 | Y)
Justification: When the principle of equal expense sharing for boundary marker installation and preservation (Factor 3) is combined with a landowner's right to install these markers (Factor 1), it creates a scenario where the defendant not only has the autonomy to decide on installations but also a clear obligation to share the financial burden equally. This indicates a legal obligation to comply with both aspects.

Each of these scenarios presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's legal obligations.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 705, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

* A person has paid money: This factor indicates that the individual has made a payment, which is a key consideration in determining the applicability of the article.
* A person has delivered anything: Similar to paying money, delivering something is another form of performance that may be relevant to the article.
* The payment or delivery was made as performance of an obligation: This factor highlights that the payment or delivery was done with the intention of fulfilling a perceived obligation.
* The person knew, at the time, that the obligation did not exist: This factor emphasizes the importance of the person's knowledge and awareness of the non-existence of the obligation when making the payment or delivery.

Verdict: A person that has paid money or delivered anything as performance of an obligation may not demand the return of the money paid or thing delivered if the person knew, at the time, that the obligation did not exist.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 705, I have generated four legal case scenarios, each assuming a subset of the factors occurred. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 1 ("A person has paid money") is present. The defendant has made a payment, but there is no information about whether it was made as performance of an obligation or whether they knew the obligation did not exist. Since the payment alone does not necessarily imply an obligation, the defendant is not obligated.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 2 ("A person has delivered anything") is present. Similar to case 1, the delivery of something does not automatically imply an obligation. Without additional factors, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, factors 1 ("A person has paid money") and 3 ("The payment or delivery was made as performance of an obligation") are present. Although the defendant made a payment with the intention of fulfilling an obligation, there is no information about their knowledge of the obligation's existence. Since ignorance of the law (or in this case, the non-existence of the obligation) might be a valid defense, the defendant is not necessarily obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, only factor 4 ("The person knew, at the time, that the obligation did not exist") is present. If the defendant knew the obligation did not exist and still made a payment or delivery (implied by the context of Article 705), they are estopped from demanding its return. The defendant's knowledge of the non-existent obligation implies an assumption of risk, making them obligated to abide by the terms of Article 705.

Note that these cases cover different combinations of factors, and each yields a clear verdict based on the presence or absence of specific factors.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Let's break down Article 179 into its constituent factors and verdict.


1. Ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person.
2. The other real right is subject to extinguishment in this scenario, 
   specifically when ownership and that real right coincide in the same individual regarding the same thing.
3. That thing or the other real right may be the object of the right of a third party.
4. If the thing or the other real right is the object of the right of a third party, 
   then the general rule of extinguishment does not apply.

Verdict: The other real right is extinguished if ownership and that real right are acquired by the same person, unless it affects the rights of a third party.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 179, I will generate four legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a unique combination of factors and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs: Ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person. However, since this is the only factor present, we cannot conclude that the other real right is extinguished without considering the impact on third-party rights or the automatic extinguishment rule. Therefore, based solely on this factor, the defendant is not obligated.

2. (1, 2 | Y)
Here, factors 1 and 2 are present: Ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person, and the other real right is subject to extinguishment in this scenario. Given that both conditions for the merger of rights are met without any exception regarding third-party rights being mentioned, the defendant would be obligated as the other real right is extinguished.

3. (1, 3 | N)
In this case, factors 1 and 3 occur: Ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person, and that thing or the other real right may be the object of the right of a third party. The presence of factor 3 introduces an exception to the general rule of extinguishment because it implies that there could be rights of a third party involved. Since we must consider the potential impact on these third-party rights, the defendant cannot be obligated without further information regarding these rights.

4. (2, 4 | N)
This scenario involves factors 2 and 4: The other real right is subject to extinguishment when ownership and that real right coincide in the same individual regarding the same thing, and if the thing or the other real right is the object of the right of a third party, then the general rule of extinguishment does not apply. Factor 4 directly counteracts the effect described in factor 2 by introducing an exception based on third-party rights. Since factor 4 explicitly states that the general rule of extinguishment does not apply when there are rights of a third party involved, and this scenario includes such a condition, the defendant is not obligated.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding whether the defendant is legally obligated based on Article 179.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information provided and apply logical reasoning.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False

The query states that A created a superficies on Land X (owned by A) for the benefit of B. B then leased Building Y (built on Land X) to C. Upon A's death, with B being the sole heir, it suggests the superficies for B shall be extinguished.

According to Article 179, if ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person, the other real right is extinguished unless that thing or the other real right is the object of a third party's right. In this scenario, when A dies and B inherits both the land (ownership) and the superficies (the other real right), since these rights now coincide in the same individual regarding the same thing (Land X), the superficies should indeed be extinguished based on Article 179(1). However, we must consider if there's an impact from a third party's rights.

Given that B leased Building Y to C, this introduces a third-party right. Yet, the crucial point is whether this leasing affects the extinction of the superficies when B inherits A's ownership. The article specifically mentions that if "that thing or the other real right is the object of the right of a third party," then the general rule of extinguishment does not apply. However, in this scenario, the superficies itself isn't directly stated to be the object of C's rights; rather, it's Building Y (which is on Land X) that C has leased.

Therefore, considering the specifics provided and focusing strictly on the relationship between A, B, and the properties/rights involved, one might initially reason that since B becomes the owner and holder of the superficies upon inheritance, and there's no direct indication that a third party's rights (C's lease) would prevent the merger of these rights under Article 179(1), the query seems to be leaning towards being True. However, careful consideration must be given to how third-party rights are affected.

### Task 2: Assess if the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **Ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person**: The query expresses this factor as it describes a scenario where B inherits both the ownership of Land X and the superficies created for B's benefit, thereby acquiring both rights.

   (query entails 1)

2. **The other real right is subject to extinguishment in this scenario**: This is also expressed in the query, which states that upon B inheriting A's properties/rights, the superficies shall be extinguished.

   (query entails 2)

3. **That thing or the other real right may be the object of the right of a third party**: The leasing of Building Y to C introduces this element, indicating the query does consider the potential impact of third-party rights.

   (query entails 3)

4. **If the thing or the other real right is the object of the right of a third party, then the general rule of extinguishment does not apply**: While the query mentions a third party (C), it doesn't explicitly address how C's lease affects the extinction of the superficies under Article 179(1)'s exception. However, it implies that despite C's involvement, the superficies is still considered for extinguishment.

   The justification here might seem to slightly diverge because the query does not delve into the nuances of how third-party rights (C's lease) would prevent the merger and thus the extinction of the superficies. It simply states an outcome without detailing the legal reasoning behind the interaction with third-party rights.

   However, based on the strict interpretation provided:
   
   (query entails 4)

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the scenario described in the query and applying Article 179(1), the critical aspect is whether B's inheritance leads to the extinction of the superficies. The query suggests that it does, implying an outcome based on the merger of rights. However, this task seems more about assessing obligations or liabilities rather than the specific legal status of property rights after inheritance.

In the context provided, there isn't a clear "defendant" or an explicit obligation being discussed in terms of legal liability or responsibility (e.g., payment, action). The scenario revolves around the legal consequence of inheriting properties and rights under Article 179(1), not about a defendant's obligations.

Therefore, given the lack of direct reference to obligations or liabilities:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 536, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party.
* The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee.
* The obligor benefits from being released from the obligation.
* The obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance is a potential outcome.

Verdict: If the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, the obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance.
Verdict: If the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, the obligee may not refuse to complete counter-performance, and in such a case, if the obligor benefits from being released from that obligation, the obligor must reimburse the obligee for the benefit.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 536, I will generate four legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors. The factors are:

1. The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party.
2. The performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee.
3. The obligor benefits from being released from the obligation.
4. The obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance is a potential outcome.

Here are the case scenarios:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs - the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party. According to Article 536, if this happens, the obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance. Since the defendant is the obligor, and the obligee can refuse counter-performance without any conditions that would obligate the defendant further (like benefiting from being released), the defendant is not obligated.

(2 | Y)
Justification: Here, only factor 2 occurs - the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee. According to Article 536, in such a case, the obligee may not refuse to complete counter-performance. This implies that if the defendant (as the obligor) does not perform, they could be in breach because the impossibility is due to the obligee's actions, potentially making the defendant obligated to compensate or fulfill other contractual obligations.

(3 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 3 occurs - the obligor benefits from being released from the obligation. Without any context of how the performance became impossible (factors 1 or 2), we cannot directly apply Article 536's conditions regarding reimbursement for benefit. The article specifically mentions reimbursement when the impossibility is due to grounds attributable to the obligee, which is not present here. Thus, based solely on this factor without further context, the defendant cannot be determined as obligated.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: This scenario involves factors 1 and 4 - the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, and the obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance is a potential outcome. According to Article 536, if the performance becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party (factor 1), the obligee may indeed refuse counter-performance (factor 4). Since this aligns with the article's conditions without any additional obligations on the defendant (like benefiting from release), the defendant is not obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Here, factors 2 and 3 are present - the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, and the obligor benefits from being released from the obligation. Article 536 states that if the impossibility is due to the obligee (factor 2), the obligee cannot refuse counter-performance, but it also mentions that if the obligor benefits from being released (factor 3), they must reimburse the obligee for the benefit. Thus, the defendant, as the obligor benefiting from release, is obligated to reimburse.

(1, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, factors 1 and 3 occur - the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, and the obligor benefits from being released from the obligation. While factor 3 suggests a potential benefit to the obligor, Article 536's provision about reimbursing for the benefit specifically applies when the impossibility is due to grounds attributable to the obligee (factor 2), which is not present here. Therefore, based on these factors, the defendant is not obligated.

(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: This scenario includes factors 2 and 4 - the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, and the obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance is a potential outcome. However, according to Article 536, when the impossibility is due to the obligee (factor 2), the obligee may not refuse counter-performance, which directly contradicts factor 4 as a standalone condition for this scenario. Given the direct application of factor 2, the defendant could be seen as obligated because the impossibility and thus any potential refusal or obligation stems from the obligee's actions.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Here, both factors 1 and 2 are considered - the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, and due to grounds attributable to the obligee. However, these cannot coexist as they describe mutually exclusive causes for the impossibility. For the sake of argument, if we consider a scenario where both conditions somehow apply or are debated, the critical factor influencing obligation would be whether the defendant benefits from being released (factor 3), which is not present here. Yet, given the direct conflict and focusing strictly on Article 536's conditions regarding obligee actions (factor 2) potentially making the defendant obligated due to the nature of the impossibility, we might argue the defendant has some obligation.

(1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: In this complex scenario, factors 1, 2, and 3 occur - the performance becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party and due to grounds attributable to the obligee, and the obligor benefits from being released. While factors 1 and 2 cannot coexist in reality as they represent different causes for impossibility, if we focus on factor 2 (attributable to the obligee) for determining obligation because it directly impacts the defendant's obligations, combined with factor 3 (benefiting from release), Article 536 clearly states the defendant must reimburse the obligee for the benefit. Thus, the defendant is obligated.

(1, 2, 4 | Y)
Justification: This scenario includes factors 1, 2, and 4 - impossibility due to grounds not attributable to either party, due to grounds attributable to the obligee, and the potential for the obligee to refuse counter-performance. Similar to previous scenarios involving conflicting or coexisting conditions of impossibility, focusing on factor 2 (attributable to the obligee) suggests that despite the potential refusal of counter-performance (factor 4), the defendant's obligations could stem from the nature of the impossibility being tied to the obligee's actions. Thus, considering the implications of factor 2 and the article's stance on such scenarios, the defendant might be obligated.

(1, 3, 4 | N)
Justification: Here, factors 1, 3, and 4 are present - the performance becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, the obligor benefits from being released, and the potential for the obligee to refuse counter-performance. Given that the impossibility is not due to the obligee (factor 1), and despite the obligor potentially benefiting (factor 3), Article 536's conditions regarding reimbursement for benefit specifically apply when the impossibility is due to the obligee, which is not the case here. Thus, the defendant is not obligated based on these factors.

(2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves factors 2, 3, and 4 - the performance becomes impossible due to grounds attributable to the obligee, the obligor benefits from being released, and the potential for the obligee to refuse counter-performance. Article 536 directly addresses a situation where the impossibility is due to the obligee (factor 2) and the obligor benefits (factor 3), stating the obligor must reimburse for the benefit. The presence of factor 4 (potential refusal of counter-performance) does not alter the defendant's obligation stemming from benefiting from the release caused by the obligee's actions. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to reimburse.

(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this comprehensive scenario where all factors coexist - impossibility due to grounds not attributable to either party and due to grounds attributable to the obligee, the obligor benefits from being released, and the potential for the obligee to refuse counter-performance - we face a contradiction in terms of the causes for impossibility. Focusing on the critical aspect that determines obligation according to Article 536, which is whether the impossibility is due to the obligee (factor 2) and if the obligor benefits (factor 3), it's clear that the defendant has an obligation to reimburse the obligee for the benefit derived from the situation caused by the obligee's actions. Thus, despite the complexity and potential contradictions in factors, the defendant is obligated.

Each of these scenarios offers a unique perspective on how Article 536 might apply, depending on the specific circumstances of impossibility and the benefits derived by the obligor. However, it's essential to note that real-world applications would require careful consideration of the actual causes of impossibility and the specific legal framework governing the obligations in question.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1: Determining the Truth of the Query

Based on the provided articles (Article 181 and Article 200), we need to assess whether a landowner who leased their land and delivered it to a lessee can demand the return of such land by way of possessory actions and also by way of actions on title based on landownership, especially in cases where the land was usurped by a third party.

Article 181 indicates that possessory rights may be acquired through an agent, which implies that the lessee could have possessory rights as an agent of the landowner. Article 200 allows a possessor who is forcibly dispossessed to demand restitution and compensation through an action for recovery of possession.

However, the query mentions demanding the return of the land both by way of possessory actions (which aligns with Article 200) and by way of actions on title based on landownership. While Article 200 supports the former in cases of forcible dispossession, it does not directly address actions based on title or ownership rights against third-party usurpers.

The articles provided focus on possessory rights and actions for recovery of possession but do not explicitly discuss the scenarios where a landowner's title (ownership) rights are used as the basis for reclaiming land from a third party. Nonetheless, in legal contexts, it is generally recognized that a landowner has both possessory rights and title rights, which can be enforced separately.

Given this understanding, the query seems plausible because it suggests the landowner has multiple avenues (possessory actions and actions on title) for reclaiming their land from a third party. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and general legal principles, the query appears to be True.

### Task 2: Assessing Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **Possessory rights may be acquired through an agent.**
   - (query entails 1) The query implies this by mentioning a landowner who leased their land to a lessee, suggesting an agency relationship where possessory rights could be involved.

2. **A possessor has been forcibly dispossessed.**
   - (query entails 2) The scenario in the query involves a third party usurping the land, which can be interpreted as forcible dispossession of the lessee or the landowner's agent.

3. **The possessor may demand restitution of the thing.**
   - (query entails 3) The query directly mentions demanding the return of the land, which aligns with demanding restitution.

4. **The possessor may demand compensation for loss or damage.**
   - (query does not entail 4) While this factor is mentioned in Article 200, the query specifically talks about demanding the return of the land and does not mention compensation for loss or damage.

5. **An action for recovery of possession is filed.**
   - (query entails 5) The query mentions "possessory actions," which implies filing an action for recovery of possession.

6. **The action for recovery of possession is against a specific successor of a person that forcibly takes possession.**
   - (query does not directly entail 6) The query discusses usurpation by a third party but doesn't specifically frame the action as being against a successor of the person who took possession.

7. **The successor had knowledge of the fact that the person has unlawfully taken the possession.**
   - (query does not entail 7) This factor is not mentioned or implied in the query, which focuses on the landowner's rights to reclaim their land rather than the successor's knowledge.

### Task 3: Determining Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given that the query discusses scenarios where a landowner can demand the return of their land from a third party who usurped it, either through possessory actions or actions based on title, it implies that the defendant (the third party) could be obligated to return the land. Therefore, the query suggests an obligation on the part of the defendant.

- pledged(1)

In conclusion:
- The query is considered True based on logical reasoning.
- The justifications for each factor align with this assessment, indicating that while the query doesn't cover every aspect of the provided articles, it is consistent with legal principles regarding possessory rights and actions based on title.
- The defendant is determined to be obligated according to the query's scenario.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 467, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent key factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* The assignment of a claim (including the assignment of a claim that is yet to arise) may not be duly asserted against the applicable obligor or any other third party.
* The assignor must give notice of the assignment to the obligor.
* The obligor's consent to the assignment is an alternative to giving notice.
* Notice or consent as referred to in the preceding paragraph may not be duly asserted against a third party other than the obligor.
* The notice or consent must be made using an instrument bearing a certified date to be duly asserted against a third party other than the obligor.

Verdict: The assignment of a claim may not be duly asserted against the applicable obligor or any other third party, unless the assignor gives notice thereof to the obligor or the obligor has consented to the same.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 467, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of these factors occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | N)
In this case, only the first factor occurs: "The assignment of a claim (including the assignment of a claim that is yet to arise) may not be duly asserted against the applicable obligor or any other third party." Since there's no notice given to the obligor nor consent from the obligor (factors 2 and 3), and no certified instrument for notice or consent (factor 5), the defendant cannot be held legally obligated due to lack of proper assertion of the assignment against them.

2. (2 | N)
Here, only the second factor is considered: "The assignor must give notice of the assignment to the obligor." Although notice is given, without the context of an assignment being made or consent from the obligor, and lacking a certified date for the notice (factor 5), it's insufficient to establish legal obligation on its own.

3. (3 | N)
In this scenario, only the third factor applies: "The obligor's consent to the assignment is an alternative to giving notice." The obligor's consent alone does not inherently imply a legal obligation without an actual assignment or formal documentation of consent with a certified date (factor 5).

4. (1, 2 | Y)
This case involves both the first and second factors: "The assignment of a claim... may not be duly asserted against the applicable obligor or any other third party" and "The assignor must give notice of the assignment to the obligor." Given that an assignment was made and the assignor gave notice, this fulfills the conditions necessary for the assignment to be duly asserted against the obligor. Thus, the defendant is legally obligated.

5. (1, 2, 4, 5 | Y)
In the final scenario, factors 1, 2, 4, and 5 are present: "The assignment of a claim... may not be duly asserted against the applicable obligor or any other third party," "The assignor must give notice of the assignment to the obligor," "Notice or consent as referred to in the preceding paragraph may not be duly asserted against a third party other than the obligor," and "The notice or consent must be made using an instrument bearing a certified date to be duly asserted against a third party other than the obligor." With all these conditions met (assignment, notice given, applicability to third parties considered, and proper documentation with a certified date), the defendant is clearly legally obligated.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on the provided civil legal article context, I will break down the text into sentences or phrases to determine the factors used in cases applying the article.


Factors:
1. A mandate may be cancelled: This phrase indicates that cancellation is a possible action regarding a mandate.
2. by either party: This phrase specifies that both parties involved in the mandate have the authority to take action.
3. at any time: This phrase establishes the timeframe for when the cancellation can occur, emphasizing flexibility.

Verdict: A mandate may be cancelled by either party at any time.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate three legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of the factors.

1. (1 | N)
In this case, only the factor "A mandate may be cancelled" is present. However, without the involvement of either party or a specified timeframe, it's unclear whether the cancellation is applicable to the defendant. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
In this scenario, the factors "by either party" and "at any time" are present. This implies that both parties have the authority to cancel the mandate at their discretion, which suggests a mutual agreement or understanding. Given this context, it can be argued that the defendant is indeed legally obligated, as they are part of the agreement that allows for cancellation by either party at any time.

3. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, the factors "A mandate may be cancelled" and "by either party" are present. This indicates that the mandate itself is cancellable and that both parties have the authority to do so. The absence of a specified timeframe ("at any time") might introduce some ambiguity, but the fact that both parties can cancel the mandate suggests a level of mutual obligation or agreement. Therefore, it can be reasoned that the defendant is legally obligated in this scenario.

Note: Each case presents a unique combination of factors, and the verdict (Y or N) is determined based on the specific subset of factors present in each scenario.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 132, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

1. A juridical act is subject to an unlawful condition.
2. The condition of a juridical act involves an unlawful act.
3. A juridical act is subject to the condition that an unlawful act not be performed.

Verdict: A juridical act subject to an unlawful condition is void. The same applies to a juridical act subject to the condition that an unlawful act not be performed.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 132, I will generate three legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the juridical act is subject to an unlawful condition (Factor 1). According to Article 132, a juridical act subject to an unlawful condition is void. However, since the article explicitly states that such an act is void, it implies that the defendant's obligation under the act would not be enforceable, but this does not necessarily mean they are not obligated in the context of being bound by the void act itself. Therefore, considering the spirit of the law aiming to prevent unlawful conditions from being a basis for legal obligations, the defendant could still be seen as "obligated" in a broad sense due to the initial agreement to such terms, even though the obligation is unenforceable.

(2 | Y)
Justification: Here, the condition of the juridical act involves an unlawful act (Factor 2). This directly ties into the principle that conditions involving unlawful acts render the juridical act void. Similar to Case 1, while the act itself may be void and thus unenforceable, the defendant's initial agreement or participation could still be considered as creating an obligation, albeit one that is not legally enforceable due to its unlawful nature.

(3 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, a juridical act is subject to the condition that an unlawful act not be performed (Factor 3). Article 132 clearly states that such acts are void. The logic applied in Cases 1 and 2 also applies here; despite the act being void due to its conditional nature involving an unlawful act, the defendant's participation or agreement could imply an obligation, albeit one that is tainted by illegality and therefore not enforceable.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors as per the instructions, with a clear justification for why the defendant would be considered obligated (Y) in each scenario, keeping in mind the nuances of legal obligations versus enforceability.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 487, I have broken down the text into phrases that represent key factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article:

* There is an instrument evidencing a claim
* The person making the performance has made full performance
* The person making the performance demands the return of the instrument
* The instrument is related to a claim

Verdict: The person may demand the return of the instrument if the conditions are met.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the article, I have generated four legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the first factor "There is an instrument evidencing a claim" is present. However, the article requires that the person making the performance has made full performance and demands the return of the instrument to be legally obligated. Since these conditions are not met, the defendant is not obligated.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the second factor "The person making the performance has made full performance" is present. Although the person has made full performance, there is no instrument evidencing a claim or a demand for its return. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(3 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the third factor "The person making the performance demands the return of the instrument" is present. Without an instrument evidencing a claim or full performance having been made, the demand for return is insufficient to create an obligation. Hence, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 2, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors "There is an instrument evidencing a claim", "The person making the performance has made full performance", and "The instrument is related to a claim" are present. Although the article mentions demanding the return of the instrument as a condition, it can be inferred that if all other conditions are met (i.e., there is an instrument, full performance has been made, and the instrument relates to a claim), the person making the performance has a legitimate basis for demanding its return. Therefore, based on these factors, the defendant is obligated.

Note: Since factor 3 ("The person making the performance demands the return of the instrument") alone or in combination with only one other factor does not necessarily lead to an obligation (as seen in cases 1, 2, and 3), I have created a scenario where multiple factors, including the relationship between the instrument and the claim (factor 4), come together to justify an obligation. This ensures that each case yields a clear verdict based on the unique combination of factors presented.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The party ordering work fails to notify the contractor of the non-conformity to the terms of the contract.
2. The notification failure occurs within one year from the time when the party becomes aware of the non-conformity.
3. The party becomes aware of the non-conformity.
4. The non-conformity refers to a specific issue with the performance.
5. The contractor delivers the subject matter of work (or finishes the work if delivery is not required).
6. The contractor knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery or completion.
7. The case falls under the main clause of the preceding Article.

Verdict: The party ordering work may not demand cure of the non-conformity of performance, demand a reduction of the remuneration, claim compensation for loss or damage, or cancel the contract if the notification failure occurs within one year, unless an exception applies. 
Verdict: The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the contractor knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery or completion.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | N)
Justification: The party ordering work fails to notify the contractor of the non-conformity to the terms of the contract. However, this factor alone is not sufficient to determine the defendant's obligation. Without knowing when the notification failure occurred or whether the contractor was aware of the non-conformity, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: The notification failure occurs within one year from the time when the party becomes aware of the non-conformity, and the party becomes aware of the non-conformity. Although these factors suggest a potential issue with the contract, they do not necessarily imply that the defendant is obligated. The contractor's knowledge or lack thereof regarding the non-conformity is crucial in determining the obligation.

(4 | Y)
Justification: The non-conformity refers to a specific issue with the performance. In this case, the defendant is obligated to address the non-conformity, as it directly affects the contract's terms. The presence of a specific issue with the performance implies that the defendant has a responsibility to correct it.

(1, 5 | N)
Justification: The party ordering work fails to notify the contractor of the non-conformity to the terms of the contract, and the contractor delivers the subject matter of work (or finishes the work if delivery is not required). Although the party's failure to notify may be an issue, the contractor's completion of the work does not automatically imply that the defendant is obligated. The timing and awareness of the non-conformity are still relevant factors.

(6 | Y)
Justification: The contractor knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery or completion. In this case, the defendant is obligated, as the contractor's knowledge or gross negligence regarding the non-conformity implies a level of responsibility. The contractor's awareness or lack thereof directly affects their obligation to address the issue.

(2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The notification failure occurs within one year from the time when the party becomes aware of the non-conformity, and the contractor knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery or completion. Given the combination of these factors, the defendant is obligated. The contractor's knowledge or gross negligence, combined with the timely notification failure, suggests that the defendant has a responsibility to address the issue.

(1, 3, 7 | N)
Justification: The party ordering work fails to notify the contractor of the non-conformity to the terms of the contract, the party becomes aware of the non-conformity, and the case falls under the main clause of the preceding Article. Although these factors suggest a potential issue with the contract, they do not necessarily imply that the defendant is obligated. The absence of information regarding the contractor's knowledge or the timing of the notification failure means that we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step.

### Task 1: Assessing the Query for Truth Value Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that where delivery of the subject matter is required, the demand for repair must be made within one year from the time of the delivery of the subject matter of the work. According to Article 637(1), if the party ordering work fails to notify the contractor of the non-conformity to the terms of the contract within one year from the time when the party becomes aware of it, they may not demand cure of the non-conformity. This implies that the time frame for notification starts from when the party becomes aware of the issue, not necessarily from the delivery time if those are different events.

However, considering typical contractual and legal practices, becoming aware of an issue often happens after or at the delivery of the subject matter. Thus, while the query simplifies the condition by tying it directly to the delivery time, in practice, the crucial factor is when the party becomes aware of the non-conformity.

Given this understanding, the query could be considered generally true but with a nuance: the key date is not necessarily the delivery date but when the party becomes aware of the issue. The article's main point is about timely notification after becoming aware of an issue, which might align closely with but isn't exactly the same as the query's focus on delivery.

### Task 2: Assessing Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The party ordering work fails to notify the contractor of the non-conformity to the terms of the contract.**
   - (query entails 1) The query implies a scenario where notification is necessary, thus it considers failure to notify indirectly.

2. **The notification failure occurs within one year from the time when the party becomes aware of the non-conformity.**
   - (query does not entail 2 directly) The query changes the reference point to "the time of the delivery of the subject matter," which may or may not be when the party becomes aware of the issue.

3. **The party becomes aware of the non-conformity.**
   - (query entails 3 implicitly) For a demand for repair to be made, it's implied that awareness of the non-conformity exists.

4. **The non-conformity refers to a specific issue with the performance.**
   - (query entails 4) The query talks about demanding repair, which implies an issue with performance.

5. **The contractor delivers the subject matter of work (or finishes the work if delivery is not required).**
   - (query entails 5 directly) It specifically mentions "where delivery of the subject matter is required."

6. **The contractor knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery or completion.**
   - (query does not entail 6) The query doesn't address the contractor's knowledge or state of mind regarding the non-conformity.

7. **The case falls under the main clause of the preceding Article.**
   - (query does not entail 7 directly) While it discusses a scenario related to contract non-conformity, it doesn't explicitly reference falling under the main clause of another article.

### Task 3: Determining if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given that the query focuses on the timing and conditions under which a demand for repair can be made, it does impose obligations based on certain actions (or lack thereof), such as failing to notify within a specified timeframe. However, it doesn't directly state an obligation in terms of being "pledged" in a contractual or legal sense without considering the context provided by the article.

- **Pledged(0)**: The query itself does not explicitly determine the defendant's obligations outside of the context provided by Article 637 and the factors outlined. It implies conditions under which certain actions can be taken but doesn't stand alone as a statement of obligation.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 549, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences to determine the factors used in cases applying this article:

1. Gifts become effective by the manifestation of intention - This indicates that the giver's intention is a crucial factor.
2. by one of the parties to give a certain property - The specificity of the property being given is another important factor.
3. gratuitously - The fact that the gift is given without expectation of payment or compensation is also a key consideration.
4. and the acceptance of the other party thereof - The acceptance by the recipient is necessary for the gift to become effective.

Verdict: Gifts become effective by the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property to the other party gratuitously, and the acceptance of the other party thereof. 

Note that this verdict sentence essentially combines all the factors listed above to determine when a gift becomes legally effective.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 549, I have identified 4 factors. Here are 4 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors:

(1 | N)
In this case, only the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property is present. However, without the specificity of the property being given, the gift being gratuitous, and the acceptance of the other party, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
In this scenario, the specificity of the property being given and the fact that the gift is given without expectation of payment or compensation are present. Nevertheless, without the manifestation of intention by one of the parties and the acceptance of the other party, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(1, 4 | N)
Here, the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property and the acceptance of the other party are present. However, since the gift is not specified and may not be gratuitous, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(2, 3, 4 | Y)
In this case, the specificity of the property being given, the fact that the gift is given without expectation of payment or compensation, and the acceptance of the other party are all present. Although the manifestation of intention by one of the parties is missing, the presence of these three factors suggests that the defendant has demonstrated a clear commitment to transferring ownership of the specified property gratuitously and the recipient has accepted it, thereby establishing a legal obligation.

Note: However, this last case may not align perfectly with the original article's requirements. To better follow the instructions and ensure alignment with the article, an alternative case could be:

(1, 2, 3 | Y)
In this scenario, the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property, the specificity of the property being given, and the fact that the gift is given without expectation of payment or compensation are all present. The only missing factor is the acceptance of the other party. Given the presence of these three factors, it could be argued that the defendant has demonstrated a clear intention to make a gratuitous gift of a specific property, which might suffice to establish a legal obligation, depending on the jurisdiction's interpretation of the article.

However, for strict adherence to the format and factors as directly derived from the article without assuming additional legal context not provided:

(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
This case includes all factors: the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property, the specificity of the property being given, the fact that the gift is given gratuitously, and the acceptance of the other party. Clearly, with all factors present, the defendant is legally obligated. 

To fulfill the requirement of having unique combinations without assuming additional legal interpretations:

(1, 2 | N)
In this case, only the manifestation of intention by one of the parties to give a certain property and the specificity of the property being given are present. Without the gift being gratuitous and the acceptance of the other party, the defendant is not legally obligated.

Thus, we have:
- (1 | N)
- (2, 3 | N)
- (1, 4 | N)
- (1, 2 | N)

And for completeness, acknowledging that a combination including all factors or a critical mass of them would likely result in a legal obligation:

The case (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) directly reflects the complete fulfillment of Article 549's conditions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 717, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person.
2. The possessor of the structure has not exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage.
3. The owner of the structure has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, but the damage still occurred.
4. There is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees.
5. Another person is liable for the cause of the damage.

Verdict: If a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person, the possessor of that structure is liable to the person incurring damage to compensate for the damage; provided, however, that if the possessor has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, the owner must compensate for the damage.
Verdict: The possessor or owner may exercise their right to reimbursement against another person who is liable for the cause of the damage.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 717, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a unique subset of the factors and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person (Factor 1). According to Article 717, if such a defect occurs, the possessor of that structure is liable to the person incurring damage to compensate for the damage. Therefore, the defendant (the possessor) is legally obligated.

2. (2 | Y)
Here, the possessor of the structure has not exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage (Factor 2). Given this scenario, Article 717 implies that the lack of necessary care by the possessor makes them liable for the damage. Hence, the defendant (the possessor) is legally obligated.

3. (1, 3 | N)
In this scenario, a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person (Factor 1), and the owner of the structure has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, but the damage still occurred (Factor 3). According to Article 717, if the possessor has exercised the necessary care, the owner is responsible. However, since Factor 2 (the possessor's lack of care) is not present, and it is stated that the owner has taken necessary care, this suggests an exceptional circumstance where neither the possessor nor the owner might be directly liable due to their exercise of care. Therefore, based on the strict interpretation of the provided factors and the article, the defendant (assuming it's the possessor or owner without further specification) might not be obligated.

4. (4 | Y)
This case involves a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees (Factor 4). Article 717 states that its provisions apply mutatis mutandis to such defects, implying that similar liability rules for structures apply to these cases. Thus, if damage occurs due to such a defect, the possessor or owner of the land with the defective bamboo or trees would be liable. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

5. (1, 5 | Y)
In this final scenario, a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land causes damage to another person (Factor 1), and there is another person liable for the cause of the damage (Factor 5). Article 717 allows the possessor or owner to exercise their right to reimbursement against another person who is liable for the cause of the damage. However, this does not absolve the original defendant (the possessor) from liability; they are still obligated to compensate for the damage but can then seek reimbursement from the other liable party. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and yields a determinate verdict regarding the legal obligation of the defendant based on Article 717.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order.
2. The order of priority is as follows: 
   - Statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels and transportation have first priority.
   - Statutory liens for the preservation of movables have second priority.
   - Statutory liens for the sale of movables, the supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor, and industrial labor have third priority.
3. If there are two or more preservers with respect to statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers.
4. A holder of a statutory lien ranked first is aware of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank at the time of acquiring the relevant claim.
5. The holder of a statutory lien of the first rank may not exercise the relevant rights of priority against those persons who have a lower-ranked statutory lien if they knew about their existence.
6. The same rule applies to the exercise against persons that have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank.
7. Regarding fruits, the ranking of statutory liens is as follows: 
   - Persons who engage in agricultural labor have first priority.
   - Persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer have second priority.
   - Lessors of land have third priority.

Verdict: If there are competing special statutory liens against the same movables, the order of priority will be determined according to the specified ranks, considering the awareness of the holder of a statutory lien ranked first and the specific rules for fruits.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order, which implies that the defendant is obligated to follow this order and prioritize the liens accordingly.

(2 | N)
Justification: Although the order of priority is specified, simply knowing the order does not automatically make the defendant obligated. There must be other factors at play for the defendant to be legally bound.

(3 | Y)
Justification: If there are two or more preservers with respect to statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers. This implies that the defendant is obligated to recognize and respect this priority.

(4, 5 | N)
Justification: Even if the holder of a statutory lien ranked first is aware of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank at the time of acquiring the relevant claim, and may not exercise the relevant rights of priority against those persons, this does not necessarily mean the defendant is not obligated in other aspects. However, in this specific case, the awareness and non-exercise of rights do not directly lead to an obligation.

(6 | Y)
Justification: The same rule applies to the exercise against persons that have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank. This means that if such preservation occurs, the defendant is obligated to respect the priority and rights associated with it.

(7 | Y)
Justification: Regarding fruits, the ranking of statutory liens is specific, and persons who engage in agricultural labor have first priority. This clear prioritization implies that the defendant is obligated to recognize and follow this order when dealing with fruits.

(1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: When all factors related to the general order of priority (factor 1), the specifics of the order (factor 2), and the rules for preservers (factor 3) are considered together, it's clear that the defendant is obligated to follow these rules and prioritize the liens accordingly in cases involving competing special statutory liens against the same movables.

According to Article 330, the order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables is as follows:
1. Statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels, and transportation.
2. Statutory liens for the preservation of movables.
3. Statutory liens for the sale of movables, the supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor, and industrial labor.

However, it specifically mentions that regarding fruits, the ranking is:
1. Persons who engage in agricultural labor have first priority.
2. Persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer have second priority.
3. Lessors of land have third priority.

Given this information, when it comes to natural fruits of agricultural land, statutory liens for agricultural labor indeed have priority over those for leases of immovable properties (lessors of land), according to the article's specific provision regarding fruits.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the specific details provided in Article 330 about the ranking concerning fruits, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order.**
   - (query entails 1) The query implies an understanding of this order, specifically in the context of natural fruits of agricultural land.

2. **The order of priority is as follows: ...**
   - (query entails 2) The query directly references a part of this order concerning agricultural labor and leases of immovables in the context of fruits.

3. **If there are two or more preservers with respect to statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers.**
   - This factor is not directly relevant to the query's scenario about natural fruits and agricultural labor vs. leases of immovables.

4. **A holder of a statutory lien ranked first is aware of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank at the time of acquiring the relevant claim.**
   - This factor does not directly apply to the query's scenario, which focuses on priority regarding fruits.

5. **The holder of a statutory lien of the first rank may not exercise the relevant rights of priority against those persons who have a lower-ranked statutory lien if they knew about their existence.**
   - This factor is not relevant to the query's specific comparison between agricultural labor and leases of immovables concerning fruits.

6. **The same rule applies to the exercise against persons that have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank.**
   - Similar to factor 5, this does not apply directly to the scenario described in the query.

7. **Regarding fruits, the ranking of statutory liens is as follows: ...**
   - (query entails 7) The query specifically addresses and aligns with this ranking concerning agricultural labor having priority over lessors of land regarding fruits.

Justifications for factors 1, 2, and 7 align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True, focusing on the specific context of natural fruits of agricultural land and the prioritization of statutory liens in such cases.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the query's statement about the priority of statutory liens for agricultural labor over those for leases of immovable properties concerning natural fruits, it does not directly determine an obligation on a defendant without additional context regarding a specific legal case or dispute. The query primarily addresses the order of priority under certain conditions.

Therefore, **pledged(0)**, as the query itself does not obligate a defendant without further details about a specific legal scenario or dispute.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 707, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

* A person performs an obligation by mistake.
* The person performing the obligation is not an obligor.
* The obligee acts in good faith.
* The obligee allows the instrument to be lost.
* The obligee damages the instrument.
* The obligee waives the security.
* The obligee loses the claim by prescription.

Verdict: The person performing the obligation may not demand the return of the subject matter of the performance.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the factors described in Article 707, we will create combinations of these factors to determine whether the person performing the obligation by mistake can demand the return of the subject matter of the performance. The factors are:

1. A person performs an obligation by mistake.
2. The person performing the obligation is not an obligor.
3. The obligee acts in good faith.
4. The obligee allows the instrument to be lost.
5. The obligee damages the instrument.
6. The obligee waives the security.
7. The obligee loses the claim by prescription.

Given these factors, we will create 7 unique case scenarios, each with a different combination of factors that lead to a determinate verdict regarding whether the defendant (the person performing the obligation) is legally obligated to not demand the return of the subject matter of the performance.

### Case Scenario 1:
(1, 2 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only two conditions are met: the person performed an obligation by mistake and was not an obligor. Without any actions from the obligee (such as acting in good faith or allowing the instrument to be lost), the performer's mistake alone does not necessarily preclude them from demanding the return of the subject matter.

### Case Scenario 2:
(1, 3 | N)
Justification: Here, the person performed an obligation by mistake, and the obligee acted in good faith. However, the good faith of the obligee does not directly impact the performer's right to demand the return unless coupled with other actions like losing or damaging the instrument.

### Case Scenario 3:
(4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the sole factor is that the obligee allowed the instrument to be lost. According to Article 707, if the obligee allows the instrument to be lost (among other conditions), and considering the principle behind such rules aims to protect against unjust enrichment or harm due to another's negligence or actions, the person performing the obligation might not be able to demand its return due to the loss of proof or basis for the claim.

### Case Scenario 4:
(2, 5 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves a non-obligor performing an obligation and the obligee damaging the instrument. Given that the instrument's damage directly affects the ability to prove or enforce the obligation, and considering the person was not supposed to perform it in the first place, they might be barred from demanding its return due to the damaged state of affairs.

### Case Scenario 5:
(1, 6 | Y)
Justification: Here, a non-obligor performed an obligation by mistake, and the obligee waived the security. Waiving security could imply that the obligee has chosen not to enforce certain rights or protections related to the obligation, potentially impacting the performer's ability to recover what they mistakenly provided.

### Case Scenario 6:
(3, 7 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the obligee acts in good faith and loses the claim by prescription. The combination of good faith actions with the legal consequence of losing a claim due to time (prescription) suggests that the performer cannot demand return because the basis for their potential claim has legally expired.

### Case Scenario 7:
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 | Y)
Justification: This comprehensive scenario includes all factors. Given Article 707's conditions and the combination of mistake, non-obligor status, good faith, loss or damage to the instrument, waiver of security, and prescription, it strongly supports that the person performing the obligation cannot demand its return due to the cumulative effect of these factors aligning with the article's stipulations.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict based on Article 707.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To analyze Article 106, I will break it down into its constituent parts to identify key factors that influence the application of this article in legal cases.

1. **Definition of Subagent's Role**: A subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof.
   - This implies that a subagent's actions are considered as actions of the principal, but only within the specified limits of their authority.

2. **Scope of Authority**: The subagent's representation is limited to acts within the scope of the authority granted.
   - The scope of authority is crucial in determining what actions a subagent can legally undertake on behalf of the principal.

3. **Rights and Obligations of Subagent**: A subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent in relation to the principal and third parties within the scope of that subagent's authority.
   - This indicates that, within their authorized scope, a subagent enjoys similar legal standings as an agent concerning both the principal they represent and any third parties involved.

4. **Relation to Principal and Third Parties**: The rights and obligations are specifically in relation to the principal and third parties.
   - The subagent's interactions with both the principal (the party they represent) and third parties (other entities not directly part of the principal-subagent relationship) are governed by the same principles as those of an agent, emphasizing a uniform treatment under the law for such relationships.

Verdict: A subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof and has the same rights and obligations as an agent in relation to the principal and third parties within that scope.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 106, I will generate four legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, only the **Definition of Subagent's Role** (factor 1) is considered. The subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of their authority. Given that the subagent's actions are deemed as actions of the principal within specified limits, it implies a level of responsibility and obligation towards the principal. Therefore, if the subagent acts within this defined role, they are legally obligated.

2. (2, 4 | Y)
This scenario involves the **Scope of Authority** (factor 2) and **Relation to Principal and Third Parties** (factor 4). The subagent's representation is limited by their scope of authority, and their interactions with both the principal and third parties are crucial. If a subagent operates within their authorized scope and engages with the principal and third parties accordingly, they are legally obligated to adhere to the principles governing these relationships.

3. (1, 3 | Y)
In this case, **Definition of Subagent's Role** (factor 1) and **Rights and Obligations of Subagent** (factor 3) are considered. The subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent within their authorized scope. Given that a subagent represents the principal and enjoys similar legal standings as an agent, they are legally obligated to fulfill these roles and responsibilities.

4. (2, 3 | N)
This scenario involves **Scope of Authority** (factor 2) and **Rights and Obligations of Subagent** (factor 3). If a subagent acts outside their scope of authority, despite having the same rights and obligations as an agent within that scope, they cannot be considered legally obligated for actions beyond their authorized limits. The lack of consideration for the subagent's role definition and their relation to principal and third parties in this context means their obligations are not clearly established beyond their specified authority.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 106, leading to determinate verdicts regarding the defendant's legal obligations based on the occurrence of these specific factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Let's break down the given article into factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

1. A juridical act is performed by an adult ward.
2. The adult ward is under guardianship.
3. The juridical act involves the purchase of daily necessities.
4. The juridical act involves any other act that is part of day-to-day life.

Verdict: A juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable; provided, however, that this does not apply to the purchase of daily necessities or to any other act involved in day-to-day life.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the given article and factors, I will generate 4 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, only factor 1 is present, which means a juridical act is performed by an adult ward. According to the article, such an act is voidable, implying that the defendant (the adult ward) may be obligated to fulfill certain obligations or face consequences for their actions.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 2 is present, which means the adult ward is under guardianship. However, there is no indication of any juridical act being performed. Since the article specifically addresses juridical acts, the mere fact of being under guardianship does not impose any obligations on the defendant.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this case, both factors 1 and 2 are present, meaning a juridical act is performed by an adult ward who is under guardianship. As stated in the article, such an act is voidable, suggesting that the defendant may be obligated to fulfill certain obligations or face consequences for their actions.

(3 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 3 is present, which means the juridical act involves the purchase of daily necessities. According to the article, acts involving daily necessities are exempt from being voidable, implying that the defendant is not obligated in this scenario.

Note: I did not include a case with factor 4 alone, as it would be similar to the case with factor 3, and including both factor 3 and factor 4 together would be redundant. Additionally, I avoided using combinations of factors that would yield the same verdict as previous cases.

article: (Order of Priority of Statutory Liens over Movables)
Article 330(1) If there are competing special statutory liens against the same movables, the order of priority follows the order set forth below. In this case, if there are two or more preservers with respect to the statutory liens for preservation of movables set forth in item (ii), a new preserver has priority over previous preservers:
(i) statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels and transportation;
(ii) statutory liens for the preservation of movables; and
(iii) statutory liens for the sale of movables, the supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor and industrial labor.
(2) In the cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, if a holder of a statutory lien ranked first knew at the time of acquiring the relevant claim of the existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank, that holder may not exercise the relevant rights of priority against those persons. The same applies to the exercise against persons that have preserved things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank.
(3) Regarding fruits, the first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor, the second rank belongs to persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, and the third rank belongs to lessors of land.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order.
2. The order of priority includes three categories: 
   - (i) statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels and transportation;
   - (ii) statutory liens for the preservation of movables; 
   - (iii) statutory liens for the sale of movables, the supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor and industrial labor.
3. If there are two or more preservers with respect to statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers.
4. The holder of a statutory lien's knowledge of existing lower-ranked liens at the time of acquiring the relevant claim is a factor in determining priority.
5. The existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank affects the exercise of rights of priority by the holder of a first-ranked lien.
6. Persons who preserve things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank are also affected by the exercise of rights of priority.
7. Regarding fruits, a specific order of priority applies: 
   - The first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor;
   - The second rank belongs to persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer;
   - The third rank belongs to lessors of land.

Verdict: If there are competing special statutory liens against the same movables, the order of priority follows the specified categories, and holders of first-ranked liens may not exercise their rights against lower-ranked lien holders if they knew of their existence at the time of acquiring the claim.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios, each using a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order (Factor 1). Since this factor is present, the defendant must adhere to this order, making them legally obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The order of priority includes three categories (Factor 2), and if there are two or more preservers with respect to statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers (Factor 3). Given that these factors are present, the defendant must navigate the complexities of priority and preservation, making them legally obligated.

(4 | N)
Justification: The holder of a statutory lien's knowledge of existing lower-ranked liens at the time of acquiring the relevant claim is a factor in determining priority (Factor 4). However, if the defendant was unaware of these lower-ranked liens, they cannot be held accountable for something they did not know. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(5, 6 | N)
Justification: The existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank affects the exercise of rights of priority by the holder of a first-ranked lien (Factor 5), and persons who preserve things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank are also affected by the exercise of rights of priority (Factor 6). Given that these factors are present, the defendant's actions may be limited by the existence of lower-ranked liens and preservers. However, this does not necessarily make them legally obligated, as their obligations may be restricted by these circumstances.

(7 | Y)
Justification: Regarding fruits, a specific order of priority applies (Factor 7). Since this factor is present, the defendant must adhere to this specific order, making them legally obligated to respect the prioritization of agricultural laborers, seed and fertilizer suppliers, and lessors of land.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order (Factor 1), and this order includes three categories (Factor 2). Given that these factors are present, the defendant must navigate the complexities of priority, making them legally obligated to respect the specified order.

(3, 7 | Y)
Justification: If there are two or more preservers with respect to statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers (Factor 3), and regarding fruits, a specific order of priority applies (Factor 7). Given that these factors are present, the defendant must consider both the preservation of movables and the prioritization of fruit-related liens. This complexity makes them legally obligated to navigate these nuances carefully.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the information in Article 330 and the specific scenario described in the query, we need to evaluate if A can exercise the right of priority against B. According to Article 330(3), regarding fruits, the first rank belongs to persons who engage in agricultural labor (which applies to B), the second rank belongs to persons that supply seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, and the third rank belongs to lessors of land (which applies to A). This means B has a higher priority than A concerning the fruits harvested on the leased land. Therefore, based on the article's provisions, A may not exercise the right of priority against B because B's lien for agricultural labor takes precedence over A's lien for leases of immovables when it comes to fruits.

**Query is False**

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The order of priority for competing special statutory liens against the same movables follows a specific order.**
   - (query entails 1) The query implies an understanding of this principle by questioning the exercise of priority between two parties with different types of liens.

2. **The order of priority includes three categories: ...**
   - (query entails 2) The scenario involves statutory liens for leases of immovables (A's lien) and for agricultural labor (B's lien), which fall under the specified categories.

3. **If there are two or more preservers with respect to statutory liens for preservation of movables, a new preserver has priority over previous preservers.**
   - The query does not directly address this scenario since it involves different types of liens (leases and agricultural labor), not preservation of movables.
   - (query does not entail 3)

4. **The holder of a statutory lien's knowledge of existing lower-ranked liens at the time of acquiring the relevant claim is a factor in determining priority.**
   - The query doesn't specify whether A knew about B's lien when acquiring the claim, so it doesn't directly address this point.
   - (query does not entail 4)

5. **The existence of a holder of a statutory lien of the second or third rank affects the exercise of rights of priority by the holder of a first-ranked lien.**
   - This factor is relevant in a general sense because B's higher-ranked lien for agricultural labor impacts A's ability to exercise priority.
   - (query entails 5)

6. **Persons who preserve things on behalf of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank are also affected by the exercise of rights of priority.**
   - The query doesn't mention persons preserving things on behalf of another, so it's not directly relevant.
   - (query does not entail 6)

7. **Regarding fruits, a specific order of priority applies: ...**
   - (query entails 7) The scenario specifically involves fruits and compares the liens of agricultural labor (B) and leases of immovables (A), which are subject to this special order of priority.

The justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False, as the correct application of Article 330's provisions regarding the priority of statutory liens over fruits supports B's higher priority.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the scenario and the conclusion that A may not exercise the right of priority against B due to B's higher-ranked lien for agricultural labor concerning fruits, it implies an obligation or limitation on A's actions regarding the fruits. Therefore, the defendant (A in this context) is determined to be obligated in the sense that they cannot assert their lien over B's.

article: Article 458-3 (1) If the principal obligor has the benefit of time forfeits the benefit, the obligee must notify the guarantor to that effect within two months from the time when the obligee comes to know the principal obligor's forfeiture of the benefit.
(2) If the obligee fails to notify the guarantor as referred to in the preceding paragraph within the period referred to that paragraph, the obligee may not request the guarantor to perform the guarantee obligation for any delay damages that have accrued after the principal obligor is accelerated and becomes immediately due until the obligee notifies the guarantor pursuant to the provisions of that paragraph (excluding those that should have accrued even if the principal obligor maintains the benefit of time).
(3) The provisions of the preceding two paragraphs do not apply if the guarantor is a corporation.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 458-3, I have broken down the text into key factors and verdicts as follows:

1. The principal obligor has the benefit of time and forfeits this benefit.
2. The obligee must notify the guarantor within two months from the time they come to know about the principal obligor's forfeiture of the benefit.
3. The notification period for the guarantor is two months.
4. The obligee comes to know about the principal obligor's forfeiture of the benefit, triggering the start of the notification period.
5. The principal obligor's forfeiture of the benefit leads to acceleration and makes the obligation immediately due.
6. Delay damages accrue after the principal obligor's obligation becomes immediately due.
7. The guarantor is notified by the obligee pursuant to the provisions of the article (excluding certain delay damages).
8. The type of guarantor (individual or corporation) affects the application of the provisions.

Verdict: If the obligee fails to notify the guarantor within the specified period, they may not request the guarantor to perform the guarantee obligation for delay damages that have accrued after the principal obligor's obligation becomes immediately due.
Verdict: The provisions do not apply if the guarantor is a corporation.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 458-3, I will generate eight legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique combination of factors and determining whether the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | N)
In this scenario, the principal obligor has the benefit of time and forfeits it (factor 1), and the obligee must notify the guarantor within two months (factor 2). However, since the notification itself is not an obligation of the guarantor but rather a duty of the obligee, the presence of these factors alone does not directly obligate the guarantor. The defendant is not obligated solely based on the principal obligor's actions and the obligee's duties.

2. (3, 5 | N)
Here, we consider the notification period for the guarantor (factor 3) and the principal obligor's forfeiture leading to acceleration of the obligation (factor 5). Without the actual notification or any direct reference to the guarantor's obligations being triggered, these factors alone do not establish an obligation on the part of the guarantor. Thus, the defendant is not obligated.

3. (4, 6 | N)
In this case, the obligee comes to know about the principal obligor's forfeiture (factor 4), and delay damages accrue after the obligation becomes immediately due (factor 6). Since the knowledge of the obligee does not directly bind the guarantor without further action (like notification), and the accrual of delay damages is a consequence rather than a cause of obligation, the defendant is not obligated based on these factors.

4. (7, 8 | Y)
This scenario involves the guarantor being notified pursuant to the provisions (factor 7) and considers the type of guarantor (individual or corporation, factor 8). Given that notification has been made and assuming the guarantor is an individual (since corporations are exempt according to the article), this triggers the guarantor's obligation. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

5. (1, 4 | N)
The principal obligor forfeits the benefit of time (factor 1), and the obligee comes to know about this forfeiture (factor 4). While these events are crucial for triggering the obligee's duties, they do not directly impose an obligation on the guarantor without further actions like notification. Hence, the defendant is not obligated.

6. (2, 5 | N)
Here, the obligee must notify the guarantor within two months (factor 2), and the principal obligor's forfeiture leads to acceleration of the obligation (factor 5). Although these factors are significant for determining the timeline and consequences of the principal obligor's actions, they do not alone establish an obligation on the part of the guarantor without considering whether notification was made. Thus, the defendant is not obligated based solely on these.

7. (3, 8 | N)
Considering the notification period for the guarantor (factor 3) and the type of guarantor (factor 8), if the guarantor is a corporation, according to the article's provisions, the rules do not apply. Therefore, regardless of the notification period, if the guarantor is a corporation, the defendant would not be obligated under these specific provisions.

8. (6, 7 | Y)
In this final scenario, delay damages accrue after the obligation becomes immediately due (factor 6), and the guarantor is notified pursuant to the provisions (factor 7). Given that notification has been made (which implies the obligee has taken necessary steps) and considering the accrual of delay damages (which would be part of the guarantee obligation unless exempted), assuming all other conditions are met and the guarantor is not a corporation, the defendant is obligated to perform the guarantee obligation for these delay damages.

article: Article 660
(1) If a third party claiming rights with respect to the bailed thing has filed a lawsuit against the bailee, or has effected an attachment, provisional seizure, or provisional disposition, the bailee must notify the bailor of that fact without delay;provided, however, that this does not apply if the bailor already knows it.
(2) Even if a third party claims a right for the bailed thing, the bailee must return the bailed thing to the bailor unless the bailor gives instructions to the contrary;provided, however, that this does not apply if the bailee notifies the bailor in advance as referred to in the preceding paragraph or is not required to notify pursuant to the provisions of the proviso to that paragraph, and the bailee delivers the bailed thing to a third party based on a final and binding judgment (including anything that has the same effect as a final and binding judgment) ordering the delivery of the bailed thing to that third party.
(3) If the bailee is required to return the bailed thing to the bailor pursuant to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the bailee is not liable to compensate any damage sustained by a third party due to the delivery of the bailed thing to the bailor.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 660, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A third party claims rights with respect to the bailed thing.
2. The third party has filed a lawsuit against the bailee.
3. The third party has effected an attachment, provisional seizure, or provisional disposition.
4. The bailee must notify the bailor of the third party's claim without delay.
5. The bailor already knows about the third party's claim.
6. The bailee is required to return the bailed thing to the bailor unless the bailor gives instructions to the contrary.
7. The bailee has notified the bailor in advance of delivering the bailed thing to a third party.
8. The bailee is not required to notify the bailor pursuant to the provisions of the proviso.
9. A final and binding judgment (including anything that has the same effect as a final and binding judgment) orders the delivery of the bailed thing to a third party.
10. The bailee delivers the bailed thing to a third party based on a final and binding judgment.

Verdict: The bailee must return the bailed thing to the bailor unless the bailor gives instructions to the contrary, except in cases where the bailee has notified the bailor in advance or is not required to notify, and delivers the bailed thing to a third party based on a final and binding judgment.
Verdict: The bailee is not liable to compensate any damage sustained by a third party due to the delivery of the bailed thing to the bailor if required to return it pursuant to the provisions.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 660, I have generated 10 unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of the factors occurred and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant (bailee) is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: A third party claims rights with respect to the bailed thing (factor 1), and the third party has filed a lawsuit against the bailee (factor 2). According to Article 660(1), the bailee must notify the bailor without delay. Since the bailee is required to take action, they are legally obligated.

2. (3, 5 | N)
Justification: The third party has effected an attachment, provisional seizure, or provisional disposition (factor 3), but the bailor already knows about the third party's claim (factor 5). As per Article 660(1), the bailee is not required to notify the bailor if they already know. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated.

3. (4, 6 | Y)
Justification: The bailee must notify the bailor of the third party's claim without delay (factor 4), and the bailee is required to return the bailed thing to the bailor unless the bailor gives instructions to the contrary (factor 6). Given these conditions, the defendant is legally obligated to return the bailed thing.

4. (7, 9 | Y)
Justification: The bailee has notified the bailor in advance of delivering the bailed thing to a third party (factor 7), and a final and binding judgment orders the delivery of the bailed thing to a third party (factor 9). According to Article 660(2), the bailee can deliver the bailed thing to the third party based on this judgment, making the defendant legally obligated.

5. (8, 10 | Y)
Justification: The bailee is not required to notify the bailor pursuant to the provisions of the proviso (factor 8), and the bailee delivers the bailed thing to a third party based on a final and binding judgment (factor 10). As per Article 660(2), the defendant can deliver the bailed thing to the third party, making them legally obligated.

6. (1, 4 | Y)
Justification: A third party claims rights with respect to the bailed thing (factor 1), and the bailee must notify the bailor of this claim without delay (factor 4). The defendant is required to take action, so they are legally obligated.

7. (2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The third party has filed a lawsuit against the bailee (factor 2), and the bailee is required to return the bailed thing to the bailor unless the bailor gives instructions to the contrary (factor 6). Given these conditions, the defendant is legally obligated to return the bailed thing.

8. (3, 7 | N)
Justification: The third party has effected an attachment, provisional seizure, or provisional disposition (factor 3), but the bailee has notified the bailor in advance of delivering the bailed thing to a third party (factor 7). Since the defendant has already taken necessary actions, they are not legally obligated.

9. (5, 9 | N)
Justification: The bailor already knows about the third party's claim (factor 5), and a final and binding judgment orders the delivery of the bailed thing to a third party (factor 9). However, Article 660(2) does not require the defendant to take action in this scenario, as the bailor is already aware. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated.

10. (6, 8 | Y)
Justification: The bailee is required to return the bailed thing to the bailor unless the bailor gives instructions to the contrary (factor 6), and the bailee is not required to notify the bailor pursuant to the provisions of the proviso (factor 8). Given these conditions, the defendant is legally obligated to return the bailed thing.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1:
Based on Article 660, the query "If a third party asserting rights with respect to the Thing deposited has brought a lawsuit against the depositary, the depositary must notify the depositor of that fact without delay" is True. This directly aligns with paragraph (1) of Article 660, which states that if a third party claiming rights with respect to the bailed thing has filed a lawsuit against the bailee, or has effected an attachment, provisional seizure, or provisional disposition, the bailee must notify the bailor of that fact without delay.

## Task 2:
Assessing whether the query expresses each factor:

1. A third party claims rights with respect to the bailed thing: **query entails 1** - The query mentions a third party asserting rights.
2. The third party has filed a lawsuit against the bailee: **query entails 2** - The query specifies that the third party has brought a lawsuit.
3. The third party has effected an attachment, provisional seizure, or provisional disposition: This factor is not directly mentioned in the query, so it does not entail this factor.
4. The bailee must notify the bailor of the third party's claim without delay: **query entails 4** - The query states that the depositary must notify the depositor without delay.
5. The bailor already knows about the third party's claim: This is not mentioned in the query, so it does not entail this factor.
6. The bailee is required to return the bailed thing to the bailor unless the bailor gives instructions to the contrary: This factor is not directly related to the notification process described in the query, so it does not entail this factor.
7. The bailee has notified the bailor in advance of delivering the bailed thing to a third party: This scenario is not described in the query, which focuses on notification due to a lawsuit, so it does not entail this factor.
8. The bailee is not required to notify the bailor pursuant to the provisions of the proviso: The query implies a requirement for notification without mentioning exceptions based on prior knowledge or other provisos, so it does not directly entail this factor.
9. A final and binding judgment (including anything that has the same effect as a final and binding judgment) orders the delivery of the bailed thing to a third party: This is not mentioned in the query, which focuses on the initial action of a lawsuit against the bailee, so it does not entail this factor.
10. The bailee delivers the bailed thing to a third party based on a final and binding judgment: Similar to factor 9, this scenario goes beyond the notification process described in the query, so it does not entail this factor.

These justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is True according to Article 660, specifically regarding the obligation of the bailee to notify the bailor upon a third party's lawsuit.

## Task 3:
The query implies an obligation on the part of the depositary (bailee) to notify the depositor (bailor) when a third party asserts rights and brings a lawsuit. Therefore, it determines the defendant (depositary/bailee) is obligated to perform this action: **pledged(1)**.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on the provided civil legal article context, I will break down the text into sentences or phrases to determine the factors used in cases applying the article.

Here are the factors:
1. A performer may deposit the subject matter of the performance with an official depository for the benefit of the obligee.
2. The deposit is made for the benefit of the obligee.
3. The performer makes the deposit with an official depository.
4. The subject matter of the performance is deposited.

Verdict: The claim is extinguished when the performer makes the deposit.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 494, I will generate four legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of these factors occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | N)
In this case, only factor 1 is present: "A performer may deposit the subject matter of the performance with an official depository for the benefit of the obligee." However, since there's no indication that the deposit was actually made or that it was done with an official depository specifically for the benefit of the obligee, we cannot conclude that the claim is extinguished. Thus, the defendant remains obligated.

2. (2, 3 | N)
Here, factors 2 and 3 are present: "The deposit is made for the benefit of the obligee" and "The performer makes the deposit with an official depository." Although these conditions suggest a structured process, without the actual subject matter of the performance being deposited (factor 4), we cannot determine if the obligations have been fully met. Therefore, the defendant is still obligated.

3. (1, 4 | N)
In this scenario, factors 1 and 4 are present: "A performer may deposit the subject matter of the performance with an official depository for the benefit of the obligee" and "The subject matter of the performance is deposited." Despite the subject matter being deposited, there's no confirmation that the deposit was made with an official depository (factor 3) or explicitly for the benefit of the obligee (factor 2). Hence, it's uncertain if all conditions for claim extinguishment are met, and the defendant remains obligated.

4. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
In this final case, all factors are present: "A performer may deposit the subject matter of the performance with an official depository for the benefit of the obligee," "The deposit is made for the benefit of the obligee," "The performer makes the deposit with an official depository," and "The subject matter of the performance is deposited." Given that all conditions outlined in Article 494 are met, including the deposit being made with an official depository for the benefit of the obligee and involving the actual subject matter of the performance, it can be concluded that the claim is extinguished when the performer makes the deposit. Therefore, the defendant is no longer obligated.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 595, I have broken down the text into key factors and verdicts as follows:

Factors:
1. The borrower is responsible for bearing expenses related to the borrowed thing.
2. The expenses borne by the borrower are limited to those that are ordinarily necessary.
3. Article 583, paragraph (2) contains provisions that apply mutatis mutandis to certain costs.
4. The costs referred to in Article 583, paragraph (2) are those other than the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing.

Verdict: The borrower bears the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing, and the provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2) apply to other costs.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 595, I will generate four unique legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of these factors. The justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated in each scenario will be based on the occurrence of the selected factors.

1. (1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 is considered: "The borrower is responsible for bearing expenses related to the borrowed thing." Since this factor directly states the borrower's responsibility, it implies that the defendant, as the borrower, is legally obligated to bear these expenses. Thus, the verdict is Yes (Y).

2. (2 | N)
Justification: Here, only factor 2 applies: "The expenses borne by the borrower are limited to those that are ordinarily necessary." This factor limits the borrower's responsibility but does not establish an obligation on its own without the context of being responsible for expenses in the first place. Therefore, based solely on this factor, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated, leading to a verdict of No (N).

3. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this case, both factors 1 and 2 are present. Factor 1 establishes that the borrower is responsible for expenses related to the borrowed thing, and factor 2 specifies that these expenses must be ordinarily necessary. The combination of these two factors clearly outlines a specific obligation for the borrower (the defendant), which is to bear the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing. Hence, the verdict is Yes (Y).

4. (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves factors 3 and 4: "Article 583, paragraph (2) contains provisions that apply mutatis mutandis to certain costs" and "The costs referred to in Article 583, paragraph (2) are those other than the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing." Although these factors do not directly mention the borrower's responsibility for expenses, they imply an extension or specification of obligations related to costs beyond the ordinary necessary expenses. Given that these provisions apply to costs and considering the legal context where such specific references to other articles typically aim to clarify or extend obligations, it can be inferred that the defendant is subject to additional obligations concerning these specified costs. Therefore, the verdict in this scenario would also be Yes (Y), as the defendant is likely obligated under the provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2), even though the direct responsibility for expenses (factor 1) is not explicitly mentioned here.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned.
2. The permission for a minor to conduct business may be revoked or limited by the legal representative if there are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.
3. A minor must obtain the consent of the minor's legal representative to perform a juridical act.
4. The requirement for consent does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation.
5. A minor may freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of for a specified purpose, to an extent that falls within the scope of that purpose.
6. A minor may also freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of without specifying a purpose.

Verdict: A juridical act in contravention of the provisions regarding consent is voidable.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate six legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a unique combination of factors and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, a minor is permitted to conduct a business and has the same capacity to act as an adult in that business. Since the minor has been granted equal capacity, they are legally obligated to fulfill their responsibilities within the scope of the permitted business.

2. (2 | N)
Here, the permission for a minor to conduct business may be revoked or limited by the legal representative due to grounds that make the minor unable to sustain the business. In this scenario, since the minor's capacity is being questioned and potentially restricted, they cannot be considered legally obligated as their ability to sustain the business is in doubt.

3. (3 | N)
In this case, a minor must obtain consent from their legal representative to perform a juridical act. Without such consent, the minor's actions are not legally binding, meaning the defendant (the minor) is not legally obligated.

4. (4 | Y)
This scenario involves a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation, where consent from the legal representative is not required. Since the minor can perform this type of act without needing consent, and it directly affects their rights or obligations, they are considered legally obligated in this context.

5. (1, 5 | Y)
In this case, a minor permitted to conduct business (factor 1) also has permission from their legal representative to dispose of property for a specified purpose (factor 5). Given that the minor has been granted autonomy in both business and property disposal within specified parameters, they are legally obligated to act responsibly within those bounds.

6. (2, 3, 6 | N)
This scenario combines factors where the permission for a minor to conduct business may be revoked or limited (factor 2), a minor must obtain consent for juridical acts (factor 3), and a minor may freely dispose of property without a specified purpose if permitted by their legal representative (factor 6). The potential revocation or limitation of business permission (factor 2) introduces uncertainty about the minor's capacity, while the need for consent (factor 3) restricts their autonomy in juridical acts. Although they have freedom with certain properties (factor 6), the overriding factors of potential incapacity and restricted autonomy mean the defendant is not legally obligated due to these complicating circumstances.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down each task in relation to the provided articles and query.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that A, a nineteen-year-old male subject to parental authority, concluded a contract for sale without consent after being permitted to carry on business. It claims A may not rescind the contract for sale even if it's not concerned with the permitted business.

Given Article 6(1), A has the same capacity to act as an adult for the permitted business. However, Article 5(1) states a minor must obtain consent for juridical acts unless merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation. Since concluding a contract for sale is a juridical act that doesn't fall under the exceptions, A should have obtained consent.

The query seems to contradict Article 5(2), which states a juridical act without consent is voidable, implying A could potentially rescind the contract due to lack of consent if it's not related to the permitted business. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the provided articles, the query appears to be False.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **A minor who is permitted to conduct one or multiple types of business has the same capacity to act as an adult as far as that business is concerned.**
   - (query entails 1) The query mentions A was permitted to carry on business, indicating this factor is considered.

2. **The permission for a minor to conduct business may be revoked or limited by the legal representative if there are grounds that make the minor unable to sustain that business.**
   - The query does not directly address revocation or limitation of business permission based on inability to sustain it, so (query does not entail 2).

3. **A minor must obtain the consent of the minor's legal representative to perform a juridical act.**
   - (query entails 3) It mentions A concluded a contract without consent, directly relating to this factor.

4. **The requirement for consent does not apply to a juridical act for merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation.**
   - The query involves a contract for sale, which is not merely acquiring a right or being released from an obligation, so (query does not entail 4) in the context of exempting the need for consent.

5. **A minor may freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of for a specified purpose, to an extent that falls within the scope of that purpose.**
   - The query does not specifically discuss disposal of property with a specified purpose, so (query does not entail 5).

6. **A minor may also freely dispose of property that the legal representative has permitted the minor to dispose of without specifying a purpose.**
   - Similar to factor 5, this is not directly addressed in the query regarding the contract for sale, so (query does not entail 6).

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the context, the query seems to imply that A (who could be considered the defendant in a scenario where the validity of the contract is disputed) may not rescind the contract. However, based on the articles provided, especially Article 5(2), A's actions without consent are voidable, suggesting A or the other party could potentially rescind or challenge the contract.

Therefore, the query does not clearly determine the defendant (A) obligated in a manner that aligns with the logical interpretation of the provided articles. Hence, **pledged(0)**.

In summary:
- The query is False based on the logical reasoning from Task 1.
- The query entails factors 1 and 3 but does not directly address or entail factors 2, 4, 5, and 6 as per Task 2.
- The outcome of pledged(0) from Task 3 indicates the query does not determine the defendant obligated according to the logical interpretation of the articles.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 446, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A guarantor has the responsibility to perform the obligation of the principal obligor when the latter fails to perform that obligation.
2. The guarantee contract must be made in writing to become effective, as stated in paragraph (2).
3. A guarantee contract concluded by electronic or magnetic record which records the terms thereof is deemed to be made in writing.
4. The provisions regarding written contracts apply to guarantee contracts made through electronic or magnetic records.

Verdict: No guarantee contract becomes effective unless it is made in writing, and a guarantor has the responsibility to perform the obligation of the principal obligor when the latter fails to perform that obligation.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 446, I will generate four legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a unique subset of these factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

### Case Scenario 1: Guarantor's Responsibility and Written Contract Requirement
(1, 2 | Y)
In this scenario, the guarantor has accepted the responsibility to perform the obligation of the principal obligor when the latter fails (Factor 1), and the guarantee contract was made in writing as required by law (Factor 2). Given that both conditions are met—there's a clear acceptance of responsibility by the guarantor and the contract is legally binding due to being in writing—the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated to fulfill the principal obligor's obligations if they default.

### Case Scenario 2: Electronic or Magnetic Record and Applicability of Written Contract Provisions
(3, 4 | Y)
Here, the guarantee contract was concluded through an electronic or magnetic record that includes all terms (Factor 3), and this type of contract is deemed to be in writing with applicable provisions regarding written contracts (Factor 4). Since the electronic/magnetic record satisfies the legal requirement for being considered as a written contract, and given that such contracts are subject to the same provisions as traditional written contracts, the defendant is legally obligated. The electronic or magnetic nature of the contract does not exempt them from their responsibilities under the law.

### Case Scenario 3: Guarantor's Responsibility Without Written Contract
(1 | N)
In this case, only Factor 1 applies—the guarantor has accepted responsibility for the principal obligor's obligation upon default. However, there is no mention of the guarantee contract being in writing or concluded through electronic/magnetic means that would satisfy the written requirement. Since Article 446 explicitly states that "No guarantee contract becomes effective unless it is made in writing," and this condition is not met, the defendant cannot be legally obligated based solely on their acceptance of responsibility without a valid (written) contract.

### Case Scenario 4: Written Contract Requirement Alone
(2 | N)
This scenario involves only Factor 2—the requirement that the guarantee contract must be made in writing to become effective. Without any information about whether this specific contract was indeed made in writing or if the guarantor accepted responsibility for the principal obligor's obligations, we cannot conclude that the defendant is legally obligated. The mere existence of a legal requirement does not automatically imply obligation; the conditions of the requirement must be fulfilled.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 446 and provides a clear justification for whether the defendant is legally obligated based on those factors.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 346, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A pledge secures the principal: This indicates that the primary amount borrowed or owed is covered by the pledge.
2. A pledge secures the interest: This means that the pledge also covers any interest accrued on the principal amount.
3. A pledge secures penalties: The pledge extends to cover any penalties incurred due to non-payment or other contractual breaches.
4. A pledge secures expenses of enforcing the pledge: The costs associated with enforcing the pledge are also covered by the pledge itself.
5. A pledge secures expense of preserving the thing pledged: This includes any costs related to maintaining or preserving the item that has been pledged as collateral.
6. A pledge secures compensation of loss or damage arising from failure to perform obligations: If the obligated party fails to meet their contractual obligations, the pledge covers any resulting losses or damages.
7. A pledge secures compensation of loss or damage arising from latent defects in the thing pledged: The pledge also extends to cover any losses or damages caused by hidden or undiscovered flaws in the pledged item.
8. The act establishing the pledge may provide otherwise: This is an exception clause, indicating that specific terms of the pledge agreement can supersede the general provisions outlined in Article 346.

Verdict: A pledge secures the principal, interest, penalties, expenses of enforcing the pledge, expense of preserving the thing pledged and the compensation of loss or damage arising from failure to perform obligations or latent defects in the thing pledged; provided, however, that this does not apply if the act establishing the pledge provides otherwise.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 346, I will generate 8 unique case scenarios, each using a different combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The principal amount is secured by the pledge, which is the primary purpose of the pledge. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated to repay the principal.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The pledge secures both interest and penalties, indicating that the defendant is responsible for not only the accrued interest but also any penalties incurred due to non-payment or contractual breaches. Thus, the defendant is obligated.

(4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The expenses of enforcing the pledge and preserving the thing pledged are covered by the pledge. This suggests that the defendant is liable for these costs, making them legally obligated.

(6 | Y)
Justification: The pledge secures compensation for losses or damages arising from failure to perform obligations. Since this factor is present, the defendant is responsible for any resulting losses and is therefore obligated.

(7 | Y)
Justification: The pledge covers compensation for losses or damages caused by latent defects in the thing pledged. This implies that the defendant is liable for any hidden flaws, making them legally obligated.

(1, 2, 4 | Y)
Justification: The principal, interest, and expenses of enforcing the pledge are all secured by the pledge. Given the cumulative effect of these factors, the defendant is clearly obligated to fulfill their obligations.

(3, 6, 7 | Y)
Justification: Penalties, compensation for losses due to failure to perform obligations, and compensation for latent defects are all covered by the pledge. The presence of these factors demonstrates that the defendant is responsible for a range of potential liabilities, making them legally obligated.

(8 | N)
Justification: The act establishing the pledge provides otherwise, which means that the general provisions outlined in Article 346 do not apply. In this case, the specific terms of the pledge agreement supersede the default rules, and without knowing those specific terms, we cannot assume the defendant is obligated. Therefore, the defendant is not necessarily legally obligated.

Note: Each case uses a unique combination of factors, and the justification for each case is based on the specific factors present.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that even if there's a special provision between the pledgee and pledgor that the pledge does not secure the interest, the pledge of movables shall still secure such interest. However, according to Article 346, "A pledge secures... provided, however, that this does not apply if the act establishing the pledge provides otherwise." This means that if the act (or agreement) establishing the pledge specifically states that it does not cover interest, then it doesn't have to, contrary to what the query suggests. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 346, the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. A pledge secures the principal: The query does not directly mention securing the principal, so it doesn't express this factor.
   - (query entails 1) = False

2. A pledge secures the interest: The query specifically mentions that the pledge of movables shall secure such interest, even if there's a provision saying otherwise.
   - (query entails 2) = True

3. A pledge secures penalties: There is no mention of penalties in the query.
   - (query entails 3) = False

4. A pledge secures expenses of enforcing the pledge: The query does not discuss expenses related to enforcing the pledge.
   - (query entails 4) = False

5. A pledge secures expense of preserving the thing pledged: This factor is not mentioned in the query.
   - (query entails 5) = False

6. A pledge secures compensation of loss or damage arising from failure to perform obligations: The query does not address this scenario.
   - (query entails 6) = False

7. A pledge secures compensation of loss or damage arising from latent defects in the thing pledged: There is no mention of latent defects in the query.
   - (query entails 7) = False

8. The act establishing the pledge may provide otherwise: The query actually contradicts this by stating that despite any special provision, the pledge shall secure interest.
   - (query entails 8) = False

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is not supported by Article 346 due to its contradiction regarding special provisions and securing interest.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query suggests a scenario where despite an agreement to the contrary, the pledge of movables shall secure interest. However, according to Article 346, specific agreements can override general provisions. The query does not align with this principle by suggesting that interest must always be secured, regardless of the agreement. Therefore, based on the information given and the principles outlined in Article 346, the query does not correctly determine the defendant's obligations as it contradicts the provision allowing for special agreements to override general rules.

- pledged(0) 

This indicates that the query does not accurately reflect the obligations as defined by Article 346, especially concerning special provisions and their impact on what a pledge secures.

2. The registration of statutory liens allows them to be exercised prior to mortgages.
3. To preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables, the budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same.
4. The expenses of the construction work must not exceed the budgeted amount in order for a statutory lien to exist.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate six legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, statutory liens must be registered in accordance with the provisions of the preceding two Articles. Since this factor is a prerequisite for exercising statutory liens prior to mortgages, the defendant is legally obligated.

(2 | Y)
Justification: The registration of statutory liens allows them to be exercised prior to mortgages. Given that this factor is present, it implies that the defendant has fulfilled the necessary conditions, and therefore, they are legally obligated.

(3, 4 | Y)
Justification: To preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables, the budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same, and the expenses of the construction work must not exceed the budgeted amount. Since both conditions are met, the defendant is legally obligated.

(5 | N)
Justification: If the expenses of the construction work exceed the budgeted amount, a statutory lien does not exist with respect to the amount in excess of the same. In this scenario, the defendant's obligation is negated due to the excess expenses, resulting in no legal obligation.

(1, 6 | Y)
Justification: Statutory liens must be registered in accordance with the provisions of the preceding two Articles, and the amount of increase in value of immovables that resulted from construction work must be evaluated by an appraiser appointed by the court. The presence of these factors indicates that the defendant has followed the proper procedures, and therefore, they are legally obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The registration of statutory liens allows them to be exercised prior to mortgages, and to preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables, the budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same. Given that both conditions are met, the defendant is legally obligated.

Note: I have ensured that no two cases use the same combination of factors, and each case yields a clear, determinate verdict.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False

Based on the provided articles, specifically Article 339 and Article 338, we can analyze the query: "Statutory liens for construction work for immovable properties whose budgeted expenses were registered prior to the commencement of the same shall prevail over the mortgage whose creation was registered prior to those registrations."

Article 339 states that statutory liens registered in accordance with the provisions of the preceding two Articles may be exercised prior to mortgages. Article 338 emphasizes the importance of registering budgeted expenses for construction work before commencing the work, suggesting a condition for statutory liens to be effective.

Given this context, if the budgeted expenses were indeed registered prior to the commencement of the construction work and before the mortgage registration, it aligns with the conditions outlined in Articles 338 and 339. Therefore, logically, such statutory liens should prevail over mortgages registered after these conditions have been met, suggesting the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **Statutory liens must be registered in accordance with the provisions of the preceding two Articles.**
   - The query implies this by mentioning "whose budgeted expenses were registered prior to the commencement of the same," indicating registration was done according to specific procedures, likely those outlined in the preceding articles. (query entails 1)

2. **The registration of statutory liens allows them to be exercised prior to mortgages.**
   - The query directly addresses this by stating that such statutory liens "shall prevail over the mortgage," which implies they can be exercised before mortgages. (query entails 2)

3. **To preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables, the budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same.**
   - This is directly mentioned in the query as a condition ("whose budgeted expenses were registered prior to the commencement of the same"). (query entails 3)

4. **The expenses of the construction work must not exceed the budgeted amount in order for a statutory lien to exist.**
   - The query does not explicitly address this condition but focuses on the registration and precedence over mortgages, assuming the conditions for existence are met. It doesn't directly express this factor.

5. **If the expenses of the construction work exceed the budgeted amount, a statutory lien does not exist with respect to the amount in excess of the same.**
   - Similar to factor 4, the query does not address the scenario where expenses exceed the budget, so it does not express this factor directly.

6. **The amount of increase in value of immovables that resulted from construction work must be evaluated by an appraiser appointed by the court at the time of the participation in the distribution.**
   - The query does not mention evaluation or distribution processes, so it does not express this factor.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, supporting the logical conclusion that the query is **True** based on the articles provided.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the context and analysis, the query implies a scenario where statutory liens have precedence over mortgages under specific conditions. However, it does not directly state an obligation of a defendant in a legal dispute. The query focuses more on the principle of precedence rather than assigning obligations to parties involved.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the nature of the query, **pledged(0)**.

 After carefully reading Article 501, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. A person that is subrogated to the claim of the obligee pursuant to the provisions of the preceding two Articles may exercise any and all rights possessed by the obligee as the effect of, and as a security for, the claim held by the obligee.
2. The exercise of rights under the provisions of the preceding paragraph is allowed only to the extent that the person that is subrogated to the claim of the obligee is entitled to seek reimbursement from the obligor based on the person's own rights.
3. If one of the guarantors is subrogated to the claim of the obligee in relation to other guarantors, the exercise of rights is allowed only to the extent that the guarantor is entitled to seek reimbursement from the other guarantors based on that guarantor's own rights.
4. A third party acquirer (meaning a person that has acquired from the obligor the property that is the subject of security) is not subrogated to the claim of the obligee in relation to any guarantors or third-party collateral providers.
5. One of the third party acquirers is subrogated to the claim of the obligee in relation to other third party acquirers in proportion to the price of each property.
6. The provisions regarding subrogation among third party acquirers apply mutatis mutandis if one of the third-party collateral providers is subrogated to the claim of the obligee in relation to other third-party collateral providers.
7. Between a guarantor and a third-party collateral provider, the subrogation to the claim of the obligee is effected depending on the number of these persons involved.
8. If there are two or more third-party collateral providers, they are subrogated to the claim of the obligee in proportion to the price of each property with respect to the amount which remains after deduction of the share of the guarantor.
9. A person that has acquired from a third party acquirer the property that is the subject of security is deemed to be a third party acquirer, and the provisions regarding subrogation among third party acquirers apply thereto.
10. A person that has acquired from a third-party collateral provider the property that is the subject of security is deemed to be a third-party collateral provider, and the provisions regarding subrogation among third-party collateral providers and guarantors apply thereto.

Verdict: The exercise of rights by a person subrogated to the claim of the obligee is allowed only to the extent that the person is entitled to seek reimbursement from the obligor or other relevant parties based on their own rights, with specific rules applying to guarantors, third party acquirers, and third-party collateral providers.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 501, I will generate 10 unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
Justification: The occurrence of factor 1 indicates that a person subrogated to the claim of the obligee may exercise any and all rights possessed by the obligee. This implies that the defendant, as the person subrogated, has the right to seek reimbursement, making them legally obligated.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Factors 2 and 3 together suggest that the exercise of rights is allowed only to the extent that the person subrogated is entitled to seek reimbursement based on their own rights, including in relation to other guarantors. This limitation does not negate the obligation but rather defines its scope, making the defendant legally obligated within those bounds.

3. (4 | N)
Justification: The presence of factor 4 alone indicates that a third-party acquirer is not subrogated to the claim of the obligee in relation to any guarantors or third-party collateral providers. This means the defendant, as a third-party acquirer, does not have the right to exercise the obligee's rights against these parties, and thus is not legally obligated.

4. (5 | Y)
Justification: Factor 5 states that one of the third-party acquirers is subrogated to the claim of the obligee in relation to other third-party acquirers in proportion to the price of each property. This implies a direct obligation among third-party acquirers based on their proportional interests, making the defendant legally obligated.

5. (6 | Y)
Justification: The occurrence of factor 6 suggests that the provisions regarding subrogation among third-party collateral providers apply similarly to those among third-party acquirers. This similarity in treatment implies that if a third-party collateral provider is involved, they too have obligations similar to those of third-party acquirers, making the defendant legally obligated.

6. (7 | Y)
Justification: Factor 7 indicates that between a guarantor and a third-party collateral provider, subrogation is effected depending on the number of these persons involved. This implies a shared obligation based on the nature and number of parties involved, suggesting the defendant has some level of legal obligation.

7. (8 | Y)
Justification: The presence of factor 8 suggests that if there are two or more third-party collateral providers, they are subrogated in proportion to the price of each property after deducting the guarantor's share. This proportional obligation indicates a clear and determinate basis for the defendant's legal obligation.

8. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Factors 1 and 2 together establish that while a person subrogated to the claim of the obligee may exercise all rights possessed by the obligee, this is allowed only to the extent they are entitled to seek reimbursement based on their own rights. This combination reinforces the notion that the defendant's obligation is contingent upon their right to seek reimbursement, making them legally obligated.

9. (4, 5 | N)
Justification: The combination of factors 4 and 5 presents a scenario where a third-party acquirer (factor 4) is not subrogated to the claim in relation to guarantors or other collateral providers but may be subrogated in relation to other third-party acquirers (factor 5). However, since factor 4 explicitly denies subrogation rights against guarantors and collateral providers, and factor 5 only addresses relationships among third-party acquirers, the defendant's obligation is negated by the lack of subrogation rights against key parties.

10. (9, 10 | Y)
Justification: Factors 9 and 10 together suggest that a person who acquires property from a third-party collateral provider or a third-party acquirer is deemed to be of the same type as the transferor for the purposes of subrogation. This implies that the defendant, by acquiring such property, steps into the shoes of the transferor regarding obligations, making them legally obligated based on the transferor's status and rights.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a clear verdict on whether the defendant is legally obligated.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query discusses a scenario where a guarantor has performed and extinguished their guarantee obligation. According to Article 501, after performing, the guarantor can exercise any rights possessed by the obligee as security for the claim held by the obligee, but only to the extent that they are entitled to seek reimbursement from the obligor based on their own rights.

Given this context, if the guarantor has performed and thus is seeking reimbursement, it seems logical that they could exercise a mortgage (a form of security) taken out on land X for the same obligation. However, Article 501 also outlines specific rules regarding subrogation among different types of parties involved in the obligation, including guarantors, third-party acquirers, and third-party collateral providers.

The key point here is whether the guarantor can exercise the mortgage for the full amount of their right to reimbursement against the obligor. According to factor 2 (The exercise of rights under the provisions of the preceding paragraph is allowed only to the extent that the person that is subrogated to the claim of the obligee is entitled to seek reimbursement from the obligor based on the person's own rights), this should be possible, as it directly relates to their entitlement for reimbursement.

However, specific scenarios and proportions are outlined in factors 4 through 10 regarding interactions between different types of parties (guarantors, third-party acquirers, third-party collateral providers). The query simplifies to a direct relationship between the guarantor's performance and their ability to exercise the mortgage without detailing the complexities of proportionate subrogation that might apply in more complex scenarios.

Based on this simplified understanding and focusing strictly on the logical flow provided by Article 501 and its factors, it seems plausible for the guarantor to exercise the mortgage up to the amount they are entitled to as reimbursement. Therefore, considering only the basic premise without delving into potential complexities not explicitly mentioned in the query, one might lean towards this scenario being possible under the conditions described.

Thus, based on logical reasoning and the information provided directly by Article 501 and its breakdown into factors, we would initially consider the query's statement as potentially **True** within the simplified context it presents.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning for all factors.

1. **(query entails 1)** The query does indeed involve a person (the guarantor) exercising rights possessed by the obligee after performing their obligation.
2. **(query entails 2)** It implies that the guarantor seeks reimbursement from the obligor based on their own right, which aligns with this factor.
3. **(query entails 3)** The query mentions a scenario where a guarantor has performed in relation to an obligation secured by a mortgage, but it does not explicitly discuss seeking reimbursement from other guarantors. However, since there's no mention of multiple guarantors, we can say this factor is indirectly considered as the principle of seeking reimbursement based on one's rights applies.
4. **(query does not entail 4)** This factor discusses a third-party acquirer not being subrogated to the claim in relation to guarantors or collateral providers, which is not directly relevant to the query's scenario focusing on a guarantor and their right to exercise a mortgage.
5. Through **10. (query entails some aspects but not all details of factors 5-10)** The query touches upon exercising a right (mortgage) after performing an obligation but does not delve into specifics about proportions or interactions between different types of parties beyond the basic guarantor-obligor relationship.

The justifications align with the initial assessment from Task 1, suggesting that within its simplified context, the query's scenario is plausible according to Article 501 and its factors.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated. If yes, represent it as pledged(1). If not, present it as pledged(0).

Given the query discusses a guarantor's right to exercise a mortgage after performing their obligation, it implies that the guarantor (who could be considered in a role similar to a defendant in this context if we were discussing obligations and liabilities) is indeed seeking to fulfill or enforce an obligation. However, the term "defendant" typically refers to a party against whom a claim is brought, and here, the query focuses on the guarantor's action after they've performed their guarantee.

In this specific scenario, since we are focusing on whether the query determines someone (the guarantor in this context) obligated or not, it seems that the guarantor has already fulfilled their obligation by performing. Thus, the query more so discusses the aftermath of fulfilling an obligation rather than determining someone as obligated.

Therefore, considering the typical legal connotations and the specific scenario presented:

**pledged(0)**

This conclusion is based on interpreting the query within its provided context and understanding that it describes a situation following the fulfillment of an obligation rather than the determination or establishment of an obligation.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 356, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* The pledgee of immovables is allowed to use the immovables.
* The pledgee of immovables is allowed to profit from the immovables.
* The immovables are the subject matter of a pledge.
* The use and profit of the immovables must be in line with the way the relevant immovables are used.

Verdict: The pledgee of immovables may use and profit from the immovables that are the subject matter of a pledge in line with the way the relevant immovables are used.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 356, I will generate four legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this case, only the first factor is present, i.e., "The pledgee of immovables is allowed to use the immovables." However, this alone does not necessarily imply that the defendant is obligated, as the article also requires that the immovables be the subject matter of a pledge and that their use and profit be in line with the relevant immovables. Without these additional factors, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, the second factor ("The pledgee of immovables is allowed to profit from the immovables") and the third factor ("The immovables are the subject matter of a pledge") are present. Although the immovables are pledged, the absence of the first factor (use) and the fourth factor (compliance with the relevant immovables' use) means that we cannot determine whether the defendant's actions are in line with the article. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: In this case, the first factor ("The pledgee of immovables is allowed to use the immovables") and the fourth factor ("The use and profit of the immovables must be in line with the way the relevant immovables are used") are present. However, without the third factor (the immovables being the subject matter of a pledge), we cannot establish that the defendant has a legitimate interest in the immovables. Furthermore, the absence of the second factor (profit) means that we are only considering the defendant's use, not their profit. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the second factor ("The pledgee of immovables is allowed to profit from the immovables"), the third factor ("The immovables are the subject matter of a pledge"), and the fourth factor ("The use and profit of the immovables must be in line with the way the relevant immovables are used") are all present. Although the first factor (use) is not explicitly mentioned, the presence of the second factor (profit) and the fourth factor (compliance with relevant immovables' use) implies that the defendant's actions are consistent with the article. Given that the immovables are pledged and the defendant's profit is in line with the relevant immovables' use, we can conclude that the defendant is obligated.

Note: The last case could also include the first factor (1), making it (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y), which would be a more straightforward scenario where all factors are present. However, I have chosen to omit the first factor in this example to demonstrate a scenario with a subset of factors that still yields a determinate verdict.

 Based on Article 485, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

1. Unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the expenses of performance, 
   - this implies that the default rule applies when there's no specific agreement regarding expense allocation.
2. those expenses are borne by the obligor; 
   - this establishes the general principle that the obligor is responsible for the expenses of performance.
3. if the obligee caused the expenses of performance to increase 
   - this introduces an exception to the general principle, focusing on the actions of the obligee.
4. by relocating the domicile thereof or taking any other act, 
   - these are specific examples of actions the obligee might take that could increase expenses.
5. the amount of increase due to this is borne by the obligee. 
   - this specifies how the exception applies, making the obligee responsible for the increased expenses they caused.

Verdict: Unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the expenses of performance, those expenses are borne by the obligor; provided, however, that if the obligee caused the expenses of performance to increase by relocating the domicile thereof or taking any other act, the amount of increase due to this is borne by the obligee.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of the factors.

1. (1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only the factor "Unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the expenses of performance" is present. Since there's no specific agreement regarding expense allocation and no other factors are considered, we cannot determine that the defendant is obligated based solely on the lack of a particular intention. The default rule doesn't apply here as we're not considering the general principle of expense allocation (factor 2).

2. (2 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves only the factor "those expenses are borne by the obligor." Given this, the defendant (obligor) is indeed legally obligated to bear the expenses of performance according to the general principle stated.

3. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Here, both the absence of a particular intention regarding expense allocation and the general principle that the obligor bears the expenses are considered. Since there's no specific agreement, the default rule applies, making the defendant (obligor) legally obligated to bear the expenses.

4. (3, 4 | N)
Justification: In this case, we consider the factors "if the obligee caused the expenses of performance to increase" and "by relocating the domicile thereof or taking any other act." Without considering who bears the increased expenses (factor 5) or the general principle of expense allocation (factor 2), we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated. The actions of the obligee alone do not establish an obligation for the defendant without further context on how expenses are allocated.

5. (1, 3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: This scenario includes all factors except the general principle that the obligor bears the expenses. However, it covers the exception where the obligee's actions increase expenses and specifies that the obligee is responsible for this increase. Given that there's no particular intention manifested (factor 1), but considering the obligee's role in increasing expenses and their responsibility for this increase (factors 3, 4, 5), we can infer that if the defendant is the obligor, they would still be responsible for the original expenses of performance not caused by the obligee's actions. But since factor 2 (general principle) isn't explicitly included, the focus is on the exception, implying the defendant could be obligated for the portion of expenses not increased by the obligee's actions, under the understanding that the absence of a particular intention (factor 1) implies the default rule would apply to the base expenses. However, the inclusion of factor 5 clarifies that the obligee bears the increase, suggesting a shared responsibility based on the actions described. Thus, considering the complexity and focusing strictly on the factors included, there's an obligation, but it's nuanced by the exception.
