article: (Special Provisions for Substitute Performance for Excessive Consideration)
Article 424-4 With respect to an act concerning the extinguishment of an obligation which has been committed by the obligor, if the value of the payment or delivery received by the beneficiary exceeds the amount of the obligation extinguished by that act, and the act satisfies the requirement prescribed in Article 424, the obligee may make demand for rescission of fraudulent act with regard to the part other than the part corresponding to the amount of the obligation extinguished, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of the preceding Article.
(Obligee's Demand for Rescission of Fraudulent Act)
Article 424(1) An obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee; provided, however, that this does not apply if a person that benefits from that act (hereinafter referred to as the "beneficiary" in this Subsection) does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.
(2) The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply to an act with a subject matter other than property rights.
(3) The obligee may make the demand under the provisions of paragraph (1) (hereinafter referred to as "demand for rescission of fraudulent act") only if the obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act prescribed in paragraph (1).
(4) The obligee may not make demand for rescission of fraudulent act if the obligee's claim is not enforceable by compulsory execution.
query: Assume that A has a claim against B for 20 million yen based on a contract for sale with B and that B is insolvent and knows that each act would be prejudicial to the obligee. B has paid a debt of 5 million yen to D in a substitute performance with land equivalent to 20 million yen owned by B. In this case, if D knew that such substitute performance would be prejudicial to the obligee, A may make a demand for rescission of fraudulent act against D with respect to the portion of such substitute performance other than the portion equivalent to 5 million yen.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The act concerns the extinguishment of an obligation which has been committed by the obligor.
2. The value of the payment or delivery received by the beneficiary exceeds the amount of the obligation extinguished by that act.
3. The act satisfies the requirement prescribed in Article 424.
4. The obligor commits an act knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.
5. The beneficiary does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced.
6. The subject matter of the act is a property right.
7. The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act.
8. The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.

Verdict: The obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee, and the obligee may make demand for rescission of fraudulent act with regard to the part other than the part corresponding to the amount of the obligation extinguished.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article, I have generated 8 legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The act concerns the extinguishment of an obligation which has been committed by the obligor. According to Article 424-4, if this condition is met, and other requirements are satisfied, the obligee may demand rescission of fraudulent act. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The value of the payment or delivery received by the beneficiary exceeds the amount of the obligation extinguished by that act, and the act satisfies the requirement prescribed in Article 424. Since both conditions are met, the obligee may demand rescission of fraudulent act with regard to the part other than the part corresponding to the amount of the obligation extinguished, making the defendant obligated.

(4 | N)
Justification: The obligor commits an act knowing that it will prejudice the obligee. However, this factor alone is not sufficient to determine the defendant's obligation without considering the beneficiary's knowledge and other conditions. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated based solely on this factor.

(5, 6 | N)
Justification: The beneficiary does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced, and the subject matter of the act is a property right. Although the beneficiary's lack of knowledge might seem relevant, it is actually a condition that prevents the obligee from demanding rescission of fraudulent act (Article 424(1)). Since the subject matter is a property right, which would normally allow for rescission, the combination of these factors still results in the defendant not being obligated due to the beneficiary's ignorance.

(7 | N)
Justification: The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act. While this condition is necessary for the obligee to make a demand for rescission of fraudulent act (Article 424(3)), it alone does not establish the defendant's obligation without considering other crucial factors like the act's impact on the obligee and the beneficiary's knowledge.

(8 | Y)
Justification: The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution. This condition, as stated in Article 424(4), is essential for the obligee to make a demand for rescission of fraudulent act. Therefore, if this condition is met, it implies that other necessary conditions have also been considered, making the defendant obligated.

(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The act concerns the extinguishment of an obligation which has been committed by the obligor, and the obligor commits an act knowing that it will prejudice the obligee. Given that both the act's nature and the obligor's intent are considered, this combination suggests a deliberate attempt to harm the obligee, thus making the defendant obligated.

(2, 5, 6 | N)
Justification: The value of the payment or delivery received by the beneficiary exceeds the amount of the obligation extinguished by that act, the beneficiary does not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee will be prejudiced, and the subject matter of the act is a property right. Although the first condition might suggest an issue with the transaction, the beneficiary's lack of knowledge (as per Article 424(1)) prevents the obligee from demanding rescission. Therefore, despite the transaction involving property rights, the defendant is not obligated due to the beneficiary's ignorance and the specific conditions surrounding the act.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 648, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The absence of any special agreements between the mandatary and the mandator regarding remuneration.
2. The mandatary's entitlement to remuneration from the mandator, which may not be claimed until after performing the mandated business.
3. The specification of remuneration with reference to a period, which triggers the application of Article 624, paragraph (2) mutatis mutandis.
4. The mandatary's inability to perform the mandated business due to grounds not attributable to the mandator.
5. The termination of the mandate during the course of performance.

Verdict: The mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator in certain circumstances, but may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed under specific conditions, such as when the mandatary is no longer able to perform due to grounds not attributable to the mandator or when the mandate is terminated during performance.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 648, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors and determining whether the defendant (mandatary) is legally obligated to receive remuneration.

1. (1 | N)
Justification: The absence of any special agreements between the mandatary and the mandator regarding remuneration means that the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator, as stated in Article 648(1). Without additional factors indicating an exception or a specified remuneration agreement, the defendant is not obligated to receive remuneration.

2. (2 | N)
Justification: The mandatary's entitlement to remuneration from the mandator, which may not be claimed until after performing the mandated business, does not in itself obligate the defendant to receive remuneration before completing the task. Since this factor alone does not provide a basis for claiming remuneration prior to completion, the defendant is not obligated.

3. (3 | Y)
Justification: If the remuneration is specified with reference to a period and Article 624, paragraph (2) applies mutatis mutandis, it implies that there are terms under which the mandatary can receive remuneration based on time, potentially allowing for payment even if the full task isn't completed. This scenario suggests an obligation for the defendant to receive remuneration according to the specified period.

4. (4 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary's inability to perform the mandated business due to grounds not attributable to the mandator allows the mandatary to demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed, as per Article 648(3)(i). This factor directly leads to an obligation for the defendant to receive proportional remuneration.

5. (1, 2, 5 | Y)
Justification: Although the absence of special agreements (factor 1) and the general rule that remuneration may not be claimed until after performing the mandated business (factor 2) might initially suggest no obligation, the termination of the mandate during the course of performance (factor 5) creates an exception. According to Article 648(3)(ii), in such a case, the mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed. Therefore, despite the initial factors suggesting no remuneration, the combination with factor 5 leads to an obligation for the defendant to receive proportional remuneration.

Task 3:
Determine whether the query determine the defendant obligated. If yes, represent it as format pledged(1). If not, present it as pledged(0).
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1:
The query states that a mandate contract is a gratuitous contract in principle, but if there is a special provision, the mandatary may demand remuneration from the mandator. According to Article 648, in the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator. This implies that normally, a mandate contract does not involve payment (gratuitous), but with special agreements, remuneration can be claimed. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query is True.

## Task 2:
1. The absence of any special agreements between the mandatary and the mandator regarding remuneration: 
   - The query mentions "but if there is a special provision," which directly relates to the absence or presence of special agreements. Therefore, (query entails 1).

2. The mandatary's entitlement to remuneration from the mandator, which may not be claimed until after performing the mandated business:
   - The query does not specifically mention when the remuneration can be claimed but focuses on the possibility of demanding remuneration with a special provision. It doesn't directly address the timing of the claim in relation to the performance of the business. Therefore, it does not entail this factor directly.

3. The specification of remuneration with reference to a period, which triggers the application of Article 624, paragraph (2) mutatis mutandis:
   - The query does not mention anything about remuneration being specified with reference to a period or the application of other articles. Therefore, it does not entail this factor.

4. The mandatary's inability to perform the mandated business due to grounds not attributable to the mandator:
   - The query does not address the mandatary's ability to perform the business or any reasons for inability. Therefore, it does not entail this factor.

5. The termination of the mandate during the course of performance:
   - Similar to factor 4, the query does not discuss the termination of the mandate or its impact on remuneration claims. Therefore, it does not entail this factor.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 as they validate the core principle stated in the query regarding special provisions for remuneration but do not delve into specifics covered by other factors.

## Task 3:
The query suggests that under certain conditions (special provision), the mandatary may demand remuneration, implying an obligation on the part of the mandator to provide remuneration if such a provision exists. Therefore, it determines the defendant (mandator) could be obligated under specific circumstances. Hence, pledged(1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 370, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* A mortgage extends to the things that form an integral part of the immovables that are the subject matter of the mortgage.
* The immovables are referred to as "mortgaged immovables".
* The extension of the mortgage does not apply to buildings on the mortgaged land.
* The act establishing the mortgage may provide otherwise, which can affect the application of the mortgage extension.
* The rescission of fraudulent act may be demanded as prescribed in Article 424, paragraph (3) with regard to the act of the obligor, which can also affect the application of the mortgage extension.

Verdict: A mortgage extends to the things that form an integral part of the mortgaged immovables except for buildings on the mortgaged land; provided, however, that this does not apply if the act establishing the mortgage provides otherwise or the rescission of fraudulent act may be demanded as prescribed in Article 424, paragraph (3) with regard to the act of the obligor.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 370, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs, where "A mortgage extends to the things that form an integral part of the immovables that are the subject matter of the mortgage." Since this is a fundamental aspect of the article, it implies that the defendant is obligated to pledge the integral parts of the mortgaged immovables.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2 and 3 occur. Factor 2 refers to the term "mortgaged immovables," while factor 3 states that "The extension of the mortgage does not apply to buildings on the mortgaged land." The presence of these two factors implies an exception to the general rule, as it specifically excludes buildings from the mortgage extension. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 4 occurs, where "The act establishing the mortgage may provide otherwise, which can affect the application of the mortgage extension." If the act provides that the mortgage extends to all parts of the immovables, including buildings, then the defendant is obligated.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 and 5 occur. Factor 1 implies that the mortgage extends to integral parts of the mortgaged immovables, while factor 5 introduces an exception regarding the rescission of fraudulent acts. However, since the act of the obligor is not explicitly stated as being fraudulent in this case, the defendant's obligation remains unaffected. Therefore, the defendant is still obligated.

(3, 4, 5 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 3, 4, and 5 occur. Factor 3 excludes buildings from the mortgage extension, factor 4 implies that the act establishing the mortgage provides otherwise, and factor 5 introduces an exception regarding the rescission of fraudulent acts. Given these cumulative exceptions and conditions, it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant is not obligated, as the specific circumstances undermine the general obligation imposed by the article.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states, "A mortgage shall extend to the buildings on the mortgaged land as long as the mortgage provides otherwise." According to Article 370, a mortgage extends to things that form an integral part of the immovables (mortgaged immovables) except for buildings on the mortgaged land, unless the act establishing the mortgage provides otherwise. The query seems to misinterpret or inversely state the condition regarding buildings on the mortgaged land. Article 370 clearly states that the extension does not apply to buildings unless specified otherwise in the mortgage's establishing act. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the content of Article 370, the query is **False** because it incorrectly suggests that a mortgage extends to buildings as a default condition when the opposite is true.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A mortgage extends to the things that form an integral part of the immovables that are the subject matter of the mortgage.**
   - The query does not directly address this aspect, focusing instead on buildings on the mortgaged land.
   - (query entails 1) is False because it doesn't consider the extension to integral parts of immovables in its statement.

2. **The immovables are referred to as "mortgaged immovables".**
   - The query mentions "the mortgaged land," which implies reference to mortgaged immovables, but does not explicitly use the term or directly address this factor.
   - (query entails 2) is somewhat True in context but doesn't fully align with the explicit mention of "mortgaged immovables."

3. **The extension of the mortgage does not apply to buildings on the mortgaged land.**
   - The query inversely states the condition, suggesting the mortgage extends to buildings if it provides otherwise.
   - (query entails 3) is False because it misrepresents the default condition regarding buildings.

4. **The act establishing the mortgage may provide otherwise, which can affect the application of the mortgage extension.**
   - The query mentions "as long as the mortgage provides otherwise," indicating an understanding that the mortgage's terms can alter the default conditions.
   - (query entails 4) is True because it acknowledges the role of the mortgage's establishing act in determining what is covered.

5. **The rescission of fraudulent act may be demanded as prescribed in Article 424, paragraph (3) with regard to the act of the obligor, which can also affect the application of the mortgage extension.**
   - The query does not mention anything related to the rescission of fraudulent acts or Article 424.
   - (query entails 5) is False because it does not consider this factor.

The justifications align with the result from Task 1 that the query is **False** according to Article 370, as it misrepresents key aspects of how a mortgage extends to buildings on mortgaged land and overlooks other critical factors.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Based on the information provided in the query and Article 370, there's no direct mention or implication regarding the defendant's obligations that can be definitively determined from the query alone. The query focuses on the conditions under which a mortgage extends to buildings on mortgaged land rather than addressing any party's obligations directly.

Therefore, without explicit mention of obligations or how they are affected by the conditions stated in the query, it is not possible to determine the defendant's obligations based solely on the information given.

Justification: The factors "the delivery of a specific thing must be effected at the place where that thing was located when the relevant claim accrued" and "the discharge of any other obligation must be effected at the current domicile of the obligee" together imply that the defendant has an obligation to deliver the specific thing or discharge the obligation at the specified locations.

(4, 5 | N)
Justification: The factors "trading hours are specified by laws and regulations or customs" and "performance may be made or demanded only within the trading hours if such hours are specified" suggest that the defendant is not obligated to perform outside of the specified trading hours.

(6, 7 | Y)
Justification: The factors "the object of a claim is designated only with reference to a type" and "the quality of the object cannot be determined in light of the nature of the juridical act or intention of the parties" together imply that the defendant has an obligation to deliver a thing of medium quality, as per Article 401.

(8 | Y)
Justification: The factor "the obligor must deliver a thing of medium quality in cases where the quality cannot be determined" clearly states that the defendant is obligated to deliver a thing of medium quality under certain circumstances.

(9 | Y)
Justification: The factor "the obligor has completed the acts necessary to deliver the thing" suggests that the defendant has taken concrete steps towards fulfilling their obligation and is therefore pledged to complete the delivery.

(10 | Y)
Justification: The factor "the obligor has designated the thing the obligor is to deliver with the consent of the obligee" implies that the defendant has come to a mutual understanding with the obligee regarding the specifics of the delivery and is therefore obligated to follow through.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: The factors "Unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the place where the performance should take place" and "trading hours are specified by laws and regulations or customs" together do not necessarily imply that the defendant has an obligation, as the absence of specific instructions regarding location does not automatically create an obligation.

(2, 6 | Y)
Justification: The factors "the delivery of a specific thing must be effected at the place where that thing was located when the relevant claim accrued" and "the object of a claim is designated only with reference to a type" together suggest that the defendant has an obligation to deliver the specific thing, even if its quality is not precisely determined.

(3, 9 | Y)
Justification: The factors "the discharge of any other obligation must be effected at the current domicile of the obligee" and "the obligor has completed the acts necessary to deliver the thing" together imply that the defendant has taken concrete steps towards fulfilling their obligation and is therefore pledged to complete the delivery at the specified location.

(5, 8 | Y)
Justification: The factors "performance may be made or demanded only within the trading hours if such hours are specified" and "the obligor must deliver a thing of medium quality in cases where the quality cannot be determined" together suggest that the defendant has an obligation to deliver a thing of medium quality within the specified trading hours.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query describes a scenario where wine, specified only by type, is to be delivered at the buyer's domicile. The seller brings the wine but the buyer refuses acceptance, and subsequently, the wine is destroyed due to arson. According to Article 484(1), unless otherwise agreed, delivery of a specific thing should occur where it was located when the claim arose, or for other obligations, at the obligee's (buyer's) current domicile, which aligns with the query's scenario. However, Article 401 suggests that if an object is designated by type and its quality can't be determined, medium quality should be delivered. The critical point here is whether the seller is relieved of the obligation due to circumstances beyond their control after attempting delivery.

Given the information:
- The seller attempted to deliver the wine at the buyer's domicile as required.
- The buyer refused acceptance despite the seller bringing the wine, which could imply an attempted performance.
- The destruction of the wine by a third party (arson) occurred after the seller had already taken steps to fulfill their obligation.

Based on these points and the principle that one cannot be held liable for events beyond their control, especially after they have fulfilled their primary obligations (attempting delivery in this case), it seems reasonable to conclude that the seller should indeed be relieved of the obligation. Thus, logically, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. Unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the place where the performance should take place - The query implies delivery at the buyer's domicile without specifying an alternative intention.
   - (query entails 1)

2. The delivery of a specific thing must be effected at the place where that thing was located when the relevant claim accrued - Not directly applicable since the wine's original location isn't specified, but it does mention delivery at the buyer's domicile.
   - (query entails 2 partially, in context of obligation fulfillment)

3. The discharge of any other obligation must be effected at the current domicile of the obligee - Directly applicable as the query mentions delivery at the buyer's domicile.
   - (query entails 3)

4. Trading hours are specified by laws and regulations or customs - Not mentioned in the query.
   - (query does not entail 4)

5. Performance may be made or demanded only within the trading hours if such hours are specified - Similar to factor 4, this is not applicable as there's no mention of trading hours.
   - (query does not entail 5)

6. The object of a claim is designated only with reference to a type - Applicable since the wine is specified by type without further detail on quality or specifics.
   - (query entails 6)

7. The quality of the object cannot be determined in light of the nature of the juridical act or intention of the parties - While not explicitly stated, it's implied as the focus is on delivery and refusal rather than quality disputes.
   - (query entails 7 partially)

8. The obligor must deliver a thing of medium quality in cases where the quality cannot be determined - Not directly addressed but since the query focuses on the act of delivery and its consequences, this factor is less relevant to the scenario's outcome.
   - (query does not entail 8 directly)

9. The obligor has completed the acts necessary to deliver the thing - The seller brought the wine to the buyer's domicile, which can be seen as completing the necessary acts for delivery.
   - (query entails 9)

10. The obligor has designated the thing the obligor is to deliver with the consent of the obligee - Not explicitly mentioned; the focus is on refusal and subsequent events rather than selection or agreement on a specific wine.
    - (query does not entail 10 directly)

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given that the seller has attempted delivery at the buyer's domicile as per their obligation, and considering the circumstances (destruction of goods after refusal by the buyer), it seems the seller should be relieved of further obligations. Thus, the query suggests the seller is **not** obligated to deliver under these specific conditions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 I have carefully read Article 498. Here are the broken-down factors:

1. The property that is the subject matter of performance or the proceeds referred to in the preceding Article are deposited.
2. The obligee may demand the return of the deposited thing if the conditions are met.
3. The obligor is to effect performance in exchange for payment or delivery by the obligee.
4. Payment or delivery by the obligee is required in order for the obligee to receive the deposited thing.

Verdict: If the property that is the subject matter of performance or the proceeds referred to in the preceding Article are deposited, the obligee may demand the return of the deposited thing.
Verdict: The obligee may not receive the deposited thing without making the required payment or delivery if the obligor is to effect performance in exchange for payment or delivery by the obligee.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 498, I will generate four unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, only factor 1 occurs: The property that is the subject matter of performance or the proceeds referred to in the preceding Article are deposited. According to the article, if the property is deposited, the obligee may demand the return of the deposited thing. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated to return the deposited property.

2. (2 | Y)
Here, only factor 2 is present: The obligee may demand the return of the deposited thing if the conditions are met. However, since this factor directly states that the obligee may demand the return under certain conditions, and we're assuming these conditions are implicitly met by focusing solely on this factor, it implies an obligation for the defendant to comply with such a demand when made. Thus, the defendant is legally obligated.

3. (3 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 3 occurs: The obligor is to effect performance in exchange for payment or delivery by the obligee. Without any mention of the property being deposited or the conditions under which the obligee can demand its return, there's no basis for the defendant to be obligated solely on the premise of an exchange. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated.

4. (1, 3, 4 | Y)
In this final case, factors 1, 3, and 4 are all present: The property that is the subject matter of performance or the proceeds referred to in the preceding Article are deposited, the obligor is to effect performance in exchange for payment or delivery by the obligee, and payment or delivery by the obligee is required to receive the deposited thing. Given these conditions, the defendant is legally obligated because the property's deposition triggers the potential for its return (factor 1), the context of an exchange requiring payment or delivery from the obligee is established (factors 3 and 4), indicating a structured transaction where obligations are clearly defined. Thus, the defendant must comply with these terms to fulfill their legal obligations.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on the provided civil legal article context, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article.

Here are the factors:
1. The parties do not specify a period of a loan for use.
2. The parties do not specify a purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing.
3. A loan for use contract is involved.
4. The lender is a party to the contract.

Verdict: If the conditions in factors 1 and 2 are met, the lender may cancel the contract at any time.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the provided factors from Article 598(2), we will create a scenario for each factor individually and then combine them in various ways to ensure all possible combinations are considered without repeating any. The factors are:

1. The parties do not specify a period of a loan for use.
2. The parties do not specify a purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing.
3. A loan for use contract is involved.
4. The lender is a party to the contract.

Given these factors, here are the scenarios:

1. (1 | N) - In this scenario, only factor 1 is present: the parties do not specify a period of a loan for use. However, since specifying a purpose or having a loan for use contract and being a lender are crucial elements that are missing, the defendant (lender) cannot cancel the contract based solely on this factor.

2. (2 | N) - Here, only factor 2 is present: the parties do not specify a purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing. Similar to scenario 1, without the presence of other critical factors like the specification of loan duration or the involvement of a loan for use contract, the defendant cannot be considered obligated to cancel.

3. (3 | N) - In this case, factor 3 is present: a loan for use contract is involved. However, since neither the period nor the purpose of the loan is specified, and there's no mention of the lender's role or rights, the defendant cannot be obligated based on this single factor.

4. (4 | N) - This scenario involves factor 4: the lender is a party to the contract. Without any information about the loan's terms, such as duration or purpose, or even confirmation that it's a loan for use, the lender's status alone does not obligate them in this context.

5. (1, 2 | Y) - When both factors 1 and 2 are present (the parties do not specify a period of a loan for use and do not specify a purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing), according to Article 598(2), the lender may cancel the contract at any time. Thus, the defendant is obligated.

6. (1, 3 | N) - Here, factors 1 and 3 are present: no specified period for the loan and it's a loan for use contract. Without the factor of unspecified purpose or the explicit mention of the lender's rights in this context, the conditions for cancellation as outlined by Article 598(2) are not fully met.

7. (1, 4 | N) - Factors 1 and 4 are present: no specified period and the lender is a party. While these factors start to build towards the conditions necessary for cancellation under Article 598(2), they do not meet all requirements since the purpose of use is not mentioned as unspecified.

8. (2, 3 | N) - Factors 2 and 3 are present: no specified purpose and it's a loan for use contract. Similar to other combinations that don't include both the lack of specification for period and purpose, this scenario doesn't meet all conditions outlined by Article 598(2).

9. (2, 4 | N) - Here, factors 2 and 4 are present: no specified purpose and the lender is a party. While closer to meeting the criteria, without the explicit mention of an unspecified loan period or confirmation that it's indeed a loan for use scenario where cancellation rights are being considered, the defendant cannot be obligated.

10. (3, 4 | N) - Factors 3 and 4 are present: it's a loan for use contract and the lender is a party. This combination lacks any mention of the terms regarding period or purpose, which are crucial for determining the right to cancel under Article 598(2).

11. (1, 2, 3 | Y) - When factors 1, 2, and 3 are present, we have all elements necessary for the conditions outlined in Article 598(2): no specified period, no specified purpose, and it's a loan for use contract. The presence of factor 4 (the lender is a party) is implied necessary for the application of this article but focusing strictly on the given combination, the defendant would be obligated.

12. (1, 2, 4 | Y) - Factors 1, 2, and 4 are present: no specified period, no specified purpose, and the lender is a party. This scenario directly meets all conditions outlined in Article 598(2), making the defendant obligated to have the option to cancel at any time.

13. (1, 3, 4 | N) - Here, factors 1, 3, and 4 are present: no specified period, it's a loan for use contract, and the lender is a party. Without the factor of an unspecified purpose, this combination does not fully meet the criteria outlined in Article 598(2).

14. (2, 3, 4 | N) - Factors 2, 3, and 4 are present: no specified purpose, it's a loan for use contract, and the lender is a party. The absence of an unspecified period factor means this scenario does not meet all conditions required by Article 598(2).

15. (1, 2, 3, 4 | Y) - When all factors are present, the conditions outlined in Article 598(2) are fully met: no specified period for the loan, no specified purpose for using and making profit from the borrowed thing, it's a loan for use contract, and the lender is a party to the contract. Therefore, the defendant (lender) is legally obligated and may cancel the contract at any time.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors without repetition, allowing for a clear determination of whether the defendant is obligated based on Article 598(2).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 698, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* A manager engages in benevolent intervention in another's business
* The purpose of the intervention is to allow a principal to escape imminent danger
* The danger is to the principal's person, reputation, or property
* The manager acts in bad faith
* The manager acts with gross negligence

Verdict: The manager is not liable to compensate for damage resulting from this unless the manager has acted in bad faith or with gross negligence.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors of Article 698, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 1 occurs - a manager engages in benevolent intervention in another's business. However, there is no mention of bad faith or gross negligence. Since the purpose of the intervention and the type of danger are not specified, we cannot conclude that the manager acted improperly. According to Article 698, the manager is not liable unless they act in bad faith or with gross negligence.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, factors 2 and 3 occur - the purpose of the intervention is to allow a principal to escape imminent danger, and the danger is to the principal's person, reputation, or property. However, there is no indication that the manager acted in bad faith or with gross negligence. Since the manager's actions were benevolent and aimed at preventing harm, they are not liable.

(4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factor 4 occurs - the manager acts in bad faith. According to Article 698, if a manager acts in bad faith, they are liable to compensate for damage resulting from their intervention. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(5 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factor 5 occurs - the manager acts with gross negligence. Similar to the previous case, Article 698 states that a manager who acts with gross negligence is liable to compensate for damage. Hence, the defendant is obligated.

(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 occur - a manager engages in benevolent intervention, aims to prevent imminent danger, the danger is to the principal's person, reputation, or property, and the manager acts in bad faith. Given that the manager acted in bad faith, they are liable to compensate for damage resulting from their actions, despite the initial benevolent intention. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1:
The query states that unless a manager engages in the management of business to allow a principal to escape imminent danger, the manager must manage the business with due care of a prudent manager. This implies that if the manager does engage in such intervention for the stated purpose, they are not necessarily bound by the same level of care, which seems to contradict the spirit of Article 698. However, Article 698 specifically addresses liability in cases of benevolent intervention aimed at preventing imminent danger and states that managers are not liable unless acting in bad faith or with gross negligence. The query misinterprets the conditions under which a manager is not liable by implying a broader obligation based on the purpose of the intervention rather than focusing on the manner of the intervention (bad faith or gross negligence). Thus, the query does not accurately reflect the conditions for liability as outlined in Article 698, making it False.

## Task 2:
1. **A manager engages in benevolent intervention in another's business**: The query mentions a manager engaging in the management of business but does so in a way that suggests this is conditional upon allowing a principal to escape danger, which slightly deviates from the factor's focus on the act of intervention itself.
   - (query entails A manager engages in benevolent intervention in another's business) with some deviation.

2. **The purpose of the intervention is to allow a principal to escape imminent danger**: The query directly mentions this condition, aligning with the factor.
   - (query entails The purpose of the intervention is to allow a principal to escape imminent danger).

3. **The danger is to the principal's person, reputation, or property**: This aspect is mentioned in the query, maintaining consistency with the factor.
   - (query entails The danger is to the principal's person, reputation, or property).

4. **The manager acts in bad faith**: The query does not directly address acting in bad faith; it focuses on the condition of due care instead.
   - (query does not entail The manager acts in bad faith).

5. **The manager acts with gross negligence**: Similar to bad faith, gross negligence is not explicitly mentioned in the query.
   - (query does not entail The manager acts with gross negligence).

Justifications align with Task 1's conclusion that the query misinterprets or does not fully capture the essence of Article 698, particularly regarding liability conditions.

## Task 3:
The query suggests that unless a specific condition is met (managing business to allow escape from danger), the manager must manage with due care, implying an obligation under certain circumstances. However, this interpretation does not directly align with determining the defendant's obligations as outlined in Article 698, which focuses on liability for damages resulting from benevolent intervention.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 539-2, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent the factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article.

Here are the factors:
1. One of the parties to a contract makes an agreement with a third party.
2. The agreement is to transfer that party's contractual status to the third party.
3. The other party to the contract gives consent to the transfer.

Verdict: The contractual status is transferred to the third party if all the above factors are met.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 539-2, I will generate three legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs: one of the parties to a contract makes an agreement with a third party. However, there is no agreement to transfer contractual status (factor 2) and no consent from the other party (factor 3). Since not all required factors are present, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
In this scenario, factors 2 and 3 occur: the agreement is to transfer that party's contractual status to the third party, and the other party to the contract gives consent to the transfer. However, factor 1 is missing: one of the parties to a contract did not make an agreement with a third party. Without all required factors, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(1, 2 | N)
In this scenario, factors 1 and 2 occur: one of the parties to a contract makes an agreement with a third party, and the agreement is to transfer that party's contractual status to the third party. However, factor 3 is missing: the other party to the contract does not give consent to the transfer. Since all required factors are not present, the defendant is not legally obligated.

To complete the analysis, I must include a scenario where all factors occur:
(1, 2, 3 | Y)
In this final scenario, all three factors occur: one of the parties to a contract makes an agreement with a third party (factor 1), the agreement is to transfer that party's contractual status to the third party (factor 2), and the other party to the contract gives consent to the transfer (factor 3). With all required factors present, the defendant is legally obligated.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The article states that for the contractual status to be transferred to a third party, three conditions must be met:
1. One of the parties makes an agreement with a third party.
2. The agreement is for transferring the contractual status.
3. The other party to the contract gives consent.

The query suggests that if B makes an agreement with E to transfer the contractual status of the buyer to E, regardless of whether A consents, the status of the buyer is transferred to E. This directly contradicts the requirement stated in the article that the other party (in this case, A) must give consent for the transfer to occur. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the conditions outlined in Article 539-2, the query is **False** because it disregards the necessity of consent from all parties involved.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **One of the parties to a contract makes an agreement with a third party**: The query expresses this factor as it mentions B making an agreement with E.
   - (query entails 1)

2. **The agreement is to transfer that party's contractual status to the third party**: The query also mentions that the agreement is for transferring the contractual status of the buyer to E, thus expressing this factor.
   - (query entails 2)

3. **The other party to the contract gives consent to the transfer**: The query does not express this factor accurately because it states the transfer happens "regardless of whether A consents," implying that consent from A is not necessary or considered.
   - (query does not entail 3)

Justification for all factors aligns with the result from Task 1, which concludes the query is False due to its failure to adhere to the consent requirement.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given that the query contradicts the conditions necessary for transferring contractual status as outlined in Article 539-2 by ignoring the need for consent from all parties, it does not accurately determine the obligations based on the article. Therefore, the defendant's obligation, as per the query's scenario, cannot be deemed correctly determined.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on the provided Article 300, I will break down the text into phrases and identify the key factors. Here's the analysis:

1. The exercise of a right of retention: This phrase indicates that the focus is on the right of retention, which is a legal concept allowing a party to withhold something (e.g., property or performance) until certain conditions are met.
2. does not preclude: This phrase suggests that there will be no obstruction or hindrance to something else happening, which in this context is related to the effect of exercising the right of retention.
3. the running of extinctive prescription of claims: This phrase refers to the process by which a claim becomes barred due to the passage of time (extinctive prescription), and its "running" implies that this process continues uninterrupted.

Verdict: The exercise of a right of retention does not preclude the running of extinctive prescription of claims. 

Note that there is only one sentence in Article 300, so the factors are closely related to each other within that single sentence.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 300, I have identified 3 factors. Here are 3 legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of these factors:

(1 | N)
In this case, only "the exercise of a right of retention" is present. The defendant exercises their right to retain property but does so without any relation to the running of extinctive prescription of claims. Since the article specifically addresses how the exercise of a right of retention affects the running of extinctive prescription and not the obligation itself, the defendant's action alone does not inherently imply an obligation regarding the claim's prescription. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated solely based on this factor.

(2 | N)
Here, only "does not preclude" is considered. This phrase, in isolation, suggests that something (unspecified in this scenario) does not hinder another process or event but lacks context regarding what it refers to or its implications on obligations. Without knowing what is not being precluded or how it relates to any legal obligation, we cannot conclude that the defendant has a legal obligation based solely on this factor.

(1, 3 | Y)
In this scenario, both "the exercise of a right of retention" and "the running of extinctive prescription of claims" are present. Given Article 300's statement that the exercise of a right of retention does not preclude the running of extinctive prescription of claims, it implies that even if a party exercises their right to retain something (e.g., property), they cannot stop the clock on the time limit for making a claim. If the defendant exercises this right and the claim becomes barred due to extinctive prescription, the defendant could be seen as obligated to return or relinquish the retained item since the basis for retention (the claim) is no longer valid due to prescription. This interpretation hinges on understanding that the retention's purpose is tied to a claim that can become obsolete.

Note: The combination and interpretation of factors are designed to provide distinct scenarios while adhering to the constraints provided, ensuring each case yields a clear verdict based on the given article.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To apply the given civil legal articles (Article 555 and Article 176) to cases involving sales or the creation and transfer of real rights, we must carefully analyze each component of these articles.

1. **A sale becomes effective** - This phrase indicates the point at which a sale is considered legally binding.
2. **when one of the parties promises to transfer certain property rights to the other party** - The promise to transfer specific property rights is a crucial element for a sale to be effective, emphasizing the importance of clear intentions regarding what is being sold.
3. **and the other party promises to pay the price for this** - The reciprocal promise to pay the agreed-upon price is another essential factor, highlighting the requirement for consideration in the form of payment for the transfer of property rights.
4. **The creation and transfer of a real right becomes effective** - This phrase pertains specifically to real rights (such as those involving land or buildings) and indicates when such transactions are legally recognized.
5. **solely by the manifestations of intention of the parties** - The effectiveness of creating or transferring real rights depends entirely on the clear expression of the parties' intentions, underscoring the principle of consensualism in property law.

Verdict: A sale or the creation and transfer of a real right is considered effective when there is a mutual agreement involving the promise to transfer specific property rights in exchange for payment (in the case of sales) or through the manifestation of the parties' intentions (for real rights).
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the factors provided from Article 555 and Article 176, we will consider each factor's impact on determining whether a sale or the creation and transfer of a real right becomes effective. The factors are:

1. **A sale becomes effective**
2. **when one of the parties promises to transfer certain property rights to the other party**
3. **and the other party promises to pay the price for this**
4. **The creation and transfer of a real right becomes effective**
5. **solely by the manifestations of intention of the parties**

Let's create case scenarios based on these factors, ensuring no two cases use the same combination:

### Case 1: Promise to Transfer Property Rights
(2 | N)  
Justification: In this scenario, only one party promises to transfer certain property rights. Without the reciprocal promise to pay for these rights (factor 3) or an indication that this pertains to the creation and transfer of a real right (factors 4 and 5), the defendant cannot be considered legally obligated as there's no complete agreement on the terms of the sale.

### Case 2: Promise to Pay Price
(3 | N)  
Justification: If only one party promises to pay the price without the other party promising to transfer property rights (factor 2), or without this being part of a real right transaction (factors 4 and 5), there's no basis for the sale to be considered effective, hence no legal obligation.

### Case 3: Creation and Transfer of Real Right
(4 | N)  
Justification: The creation and transfer of a real right becoming effective (factor 4) alone does not establish an obligation without the manifestation of intentions by both parties (factor 5). This factor by itself indicates a type of transaction but doesn't confirm an agreement.

### Case 4: Manifestation of Intentions for Real Right
(5 | N)  
Justification: The sole manifestation of intention (factor 5) for creating or transferring a real right, without specifying that such a transaction is taking place (factor 4), does not establish a clear obligation. There must be an understood context of what these intentions apply to.

### Case 5: Sale Becomes Effective with Promise to Transfer
(1, 2 | N)  
Justification: Even if a sale becomes effective (factor 1) and there's a promise to transfer property rights (factor 2), without the reciprocal agreement on payment (factor 3), the terms of the sale are incomplete, and thus no legal obligation can be determined.

### Case 6: Complete Sale Agreement
(1, 2, 3 | Y)  
Justification: When all elements of a sale are present—a sale becomes effective (factor 1), there's a promise to transfer property rights (factor 2), and a promise to pay the price (factor 3)—the defendant can be considered legally obligated as all necessary components for a valid sale agreement are met.

### Case 7: Real Right Transaction with Intentions
(4, 5 | Y)  
Justification: If the creation and transfer of a real right becomes effective (factor 4) and this is done solely by the manifestations of intention of the parties (factor 5), then there's a clear basis for legal obligation. Both parties have expressed their intentions regarding the real right, which aligns with the principle that such transactions are consensual.

### Case 8: All Factors Present
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)  
Justification: When all factors are present, indicating a comprehensive agreement that covers both the sale of property and the creation or transfer of real rights, with clear intentions from both parties regarding the terms (including payment and property rights transfer), the defendant is most certainly legally obligated. This scenario represents a complete and thorough agreement that meets all legal requirements for such transactions.

Each case provides a unique combination of factors to assess whether the defendant is legally obligated based on the specifics of the sale or real right transaction in question.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 650, I will generate 8 legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors. Here are the cases:

1. (1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary has expended costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business and the costs were expended by the mandatary. According to Article 650(1), the mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator, indicating that the defendant (mandator) is legally obligated.

2. (3, 4 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary has borne any obligation found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business and the obligation was necessary for the administration of the mandated business. As per Article 650(2), the mandatary may demand that the mandator perform the obligation on the mandatary's behalf, demonstrating that the defendant is obligated.

3. (5 | N)
Justification: The only factor present is that the obligation has not yet fallen due. Without any other factors indicating the necessity of the obligation or its relation to the mandated business, Article 650 does not provide a basis for the mandator's obligation solely on this ground.

4. (6, 7 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary incurs loss or damage and the loss or damage is not due to the negligence of the mandatary. Given that these conditions are met, and considering the spirit of Article 650(3) which allows for compensation in cases where the mandatary is not at fault, it can be inferred that the defendant (mandator) would be obligated to provide compensation.

5. (1, 6 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary has expended costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business and the mandatary incurs loss or damage. This combination suggests that both reimbursement for costs and compensation for loss or damage could be claimed under Article 650(1) and (3), respectively, indicating the defendant's obligation.

6. (2, 8 | Y)
Justification: The costs were expended by the mandatary and the loss or damage was incurred in order to administer the mandated business. These factors together imply that the actions taken by the mandatary were for the purpose of administering the mandated business, potentially entitling them to reimbursement or compensation under Article 650(1) or (3), thus obligating the defendant.

7. (4, 8 | Y)
Justification: The obligation was necessary for the administration of the mandated business and the loss or damage was incurred in order to administer the mandated business. This combination supports the notion that any obligations or losses were directly related to the mandated business's administration, aligning with Article 650's provisions for reimbursement or compensation, thereby obligating the defendant.

8. (3, 5 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary has borne any obligation found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business and the obligation has not yet fallen due. According to Article 650(2), in such cases where an obligation is necessary but not yet due, the mandatary may require the mandator to tender reasonable security, demonstrating that the defendant is indeed obligated to provide this security.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's legal obligations under Article 650.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query suggests that even if costs incurred by a mandatary are later deemed unnecessary, they can still demand reimbursement from the mandator. However, according to Article 650, the mandatary may claim reimbursement of costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business. This implies that the necessity of the costs is a condition for reimbursement. Therefore, if costs are deemed not necessary, the logical interpretation based on Article 650 would suggest that the query is False.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The mandatary has expended costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business.**
   - (query entails 1) The query mentions costs incurred by the mandatary but specifies that these costs are later deemed not necessary, which contrasts with this factor.

2. **The costs were expended by the mandatary.**
   - (query entails 2) The query does mention costs incurred by the mandatary, aligning with this factor.

3. **The mandatary has borne any obligation found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business.**
   - The query does not directly address obligations borne by the mandatary, so it does not entail this factor.

4. **The obligation was necessary for the administration of the mandated business.**
   - Similar to factor 3, the query does not discuss obligations in relation to necessity, so it does not entail this factor.

5. **The obligation has not yet fallen due.**
   - The query does not mention anything about obligations or their due dates, so it does not entail this factor.

6. **The mandatary incurs loss or damage.**
   - (query entails 6) The query implies a situation where the mandatary incurs costs, which could be considered as incurring loss or damage if those costs are deemed unnecessary.

7. **The loss or damage is not due to the negligence of the mandatary.**
   - The query mentions that the costs were incurred with the care of a good manager, implying no negligence, so (query entails 7).

8. **The loss or damage was incurred in order to administer the mandated business.**
   - (query entails 8) The query specifies that the costs were incurred to administrate the mandated business, aligning with this factor.

Justifications generally support the initial assessment that the query's claim about reimbursement for unnecessary costs contradicts Article 650, thus leaning towards a False determination in Task 1.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context, if we consider the mandatary as potentially being able to demand reimbursement (as per the query's scenario), the query implies that the mandator (the defendant in this context) could be obligated to reimburse costs. However, based on the logical reasoning from Task 1 and the factors assessed in Task 2, the query's premise about reimbursement for unnecessary costs does not align with Article 650. Therefore, under a strict interpretation of Article 650, the query does not accurately determine the defendant's obligations as it misinterprets the conditions for reimbursement.

- pledged(0) 

This conclusion is based on the misunderstanding presented by the query regarding the conditions under which a mandatary can claim reimbursement from the mandator according to Article 650.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 478, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article:

1. Performance is made to a person that does not constitute a person authorized to accept the performance.
2. The person appears to be the one authorized to accept the performance in light of common sense in the transaction.
3. The person effecting performance was acting in good faith.
4. The person effecting performance was without negligence.

Verdict: Performance made to such a person is effective only if factors 3 and 4 are met, meaning the person effecting performance was acting in good faith and without negligence.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 478, I have generated four legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: Performance is made to a person that does not constitute a person authorized to accept the performance. However, this factor alone is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of the performance. The article requires additional factors to be present for the performance to be effective.

(2 | N)
Justification: Although the person appears to be the one authorized to accept the performance in light of common sense in the transaction, this factor alone does not guarantee the effectiveness of the performance. The article explicitly states that the performance is only effective if the person effecting performance was acting in good faith and without negligence.

(3 | N)
Justification: Acting in good faith is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the performance to be effective. Without the presence of other factors, such as the absence of negligence or the apparent authority of the recipient, the defendant's good faith alone does not obligate them.

(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, all factors are present: performance is made to a person that does not constitute a person authorized to accept the performance, but they appear to be authorized; the person effecting performance was acting in good faith and without negligence. According to Article 478, the performance is effective only if the person effecting performance was acting in good faith and without negligence, which is the case here. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

Note that I had to generate a fourth case that includes all factors to ensure that each factor is used at least once and that no two cases use the same combination of factors. The other combinations (e.g., 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc.) would not yield a clear verdict based on the article alone, as they do not meet the conditions specified in Article 478 for the performance to be effective.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down each task in relation to the provided article and query.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The article states that a performance made to a person who does not constitute an authorized person to accept the performance but appears to be so based on common sense in the transaction is effective only if the person effecting performance was acting in good faith and without negligence.

The query mentions that any performance made vis-a-vis a quasi-possessor of a claim is effective when the performer acts without knowledge, and is free from any negligence. This implies a scenario where the performer's lack of knowledge about the true status of the recipient (in this case, a quasi-possessor) combined with their freedom from negligence makes the performance effective.

Given that both the article and query discuss scenarios where performances are considered effective under conditions related to the performer's state of mind (good faith, without negligence, or without knowledge), but the query introduces the concept of "quasi-possessor" which is not directly addressed in Article 478, we must consider whether these concepts align.

However, since the article and the query both touch on the effectiveness of a performance under certain conditions related to the performer's awareness and diligence (or lack thereof), and considering that acting without knowledge can be interpreted as part of acting in good faith if one had no reason to suspect otherwise, there is a basis for comparing them directly.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided, the query seems to align with the principles outlined in Article 478, especially concerning the conditions under which a performance is considered effective (good faith, lack of negligence). Thus, we can consider the query as generally true in the context of assessing performance effectiveness under similar conditions.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **Performance is made to a person that does not constitute a person authorized to accept the performance.**
   - The query mentions "quasi-possessor of a claim," which could be interpreted as someone who may not fully constitute an authorized person in all contexts but has some form of possessory rights or claims, thus (query entails 1).

2. **The person appears to be the one authorized to accept the performance in light of common sense in the transaction.**
   - This factor is about appearance based on common sense, which isn't directly addressed by the query's mention of "without knowledge" and "free from any negligence." Thus, it doesn't explicitly consider this aspect of appearances or common sense understanding, so (query does not entail 2).

3. **The person effecting performance was acting in good faith.**
   - Acting without knowledge can be seen as part of acting in good faith if the lack of knowledge wasn't due to negligence. Hence, there's an implication that good faith is involved when one acts "without knowledge," leading to (query entails 3).

4. **The person effecting performance was without negligence.**
   - The query explicitly mentions being "free from any negligence," directly aligning with this factor, thus (query entails 4).

These justifications generally support the conclusion from Task 1 that the query aligns with the principles of Article 478 under certain conditions.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query discusses conditions under which a performance is considered effective rather than directly addressing obligations of a defendant. However, if we interpret "effective" as implying that the performer (potentially the defendant in a legal context) has fulfilled their obligation under certain conditions, then it could be argued that the query implies a situation where the defendant might be considered to have met their obligations if acting without knowledge and free from negligence.

Thus, depending on the interpretation of "effective performance" in relation to obligations, one might argue that the query suggests a scenario where the defendant's actions could fulfill their obligations under specific conditions. However, this does not directly state the defendant is obligated but rather under what circumstances their actions might be considered valid or effective.

Given this nuance and focusing strictly on whether the query explicitly determines the defendant as obligated, we would represent it as pledged(0), since it doesn't directly address or imply an obligation in a manner that clearly binds the defendant to a specific duty without additional context.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 504, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list:

1. A person has a legitimate interest in performing an obligation (referred to as a "person entitled to subrogation").
2. The obligee causes the security thereof to be lost or diminished.
3. The loss or diminution of security is intentional or negligent.
4. The person entitled to subrogation can no longer seek reimbursement due to the loss or diminution in the security available upon subrogation.

Verdict: The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the obligee is found to have reasonable grounds in light of the common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be lost or diminished.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the factors described in Article 504, I will generate 8 legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a unique combination of factors and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.


(1 | Y)
In this case, we have a person with a legitimate interest in performing an obligation (factor 1). Although no other factors are present, having a legitimate interest establishes a foundation for potential subrogation. Therefore, the defendant could be considered obligated as they may be entitled to subrogation rights.


(2 | N)
Here, the obligee causes the security thereof to be lost or diminished (factor 2), but without intent, negligence, or any other factors. The article does not specify that mere loss or diminution of security automatically relieves the person entitled to subrogation from responsibility. Hence, the defendant is not obligated.


(1, 3 | Y)
In this scenario, a person has a legitimate interest in performing an obligation (factor 1), and the obligee's actions are intentional or negligent (factor 3). The combination of these factors suggests that the defendant could be relieved from responsibility due to the obligee's fault. Thus, the defendant is obligated.


(4 | N)
The person entitled to subrogation can no longer seek reimbursement due to the loss or diminution in the security available upon subrogation (factor 4). However, without more context about how this situation arose, it's difficult to determine the defendant's obligation directly from this factor alone. Therefore, based solely on this information, the defendant is not obligated.


(1, 2, 5 | Y)
Here, a person has a legitimate interest in performing an obligation (factor 1), the obligee causes the security thereof to be lost or diminished (factor 2), and the person entitled to subrogation is a third-party collateral provider (factor 5). This combination indicates that the defendant could be relieved from responsibility due to the loss or diminution caused by the obligee, especially considering their role as a third-party collateral provider. Hence, the defendant is obligated.


(6 | N)
A third party has acquired from the person entitled to subrogation the property that is the subject of security (factor 6), but without any indication of how this affects the obligation or if there was any loss/diminution of security due to negligence or intent. This factor alone does not directly imply an obligation on the defendant's part. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.


(1, 7 | Y)
In this case, a person has a legitimate interest in performing an obligation (factor 1), and there is a specific successor of the third party that has acquired the property (factor 7). The presence of a successor implies a chain of interests that could affect subrogation rights. Considering the legitimate interest and the involvement of successors, it's reasonable to consider the defendant obligated.


(8 | N)
The obligee has reasonable grounds in light of common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be lost or diminished (factor 8). According to Article 504, if such reasonable grounds exist, the provisions that would relieve the person entitled to subrogation from responsibility do not apply. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.


These scenarios provide a range of combinations where the presence and interaction of different factors lead to determinate verdicts regarding the defendant's obligation based on Article 504.

======= Query Entaiments:
 ### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if the obligee has reasonable grounds for causing the security to be diminished, the guarantor may not assert relief from responsibility due to the diminution in security available upon subrogation. According to Article 504(2), "The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the obligee is found to have reasonable grounds in light of the common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be lost or diminished." This means that if the obligee has a valid reason for the diminution, the guarantor (person entitled to subrogation) cannot claim relief from responsibility due to the loss or diminution. Therefore, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. A person has a legitimate interest in performing an obligation (referred to as a "person entitled to subrogation").  
   - The query does not directly mention a person having a legitimate interest but implies the guarantor's situation, which aligns with this concept. **(query entails 1)**

2. The obligee causes the security thereof to be lost or diminished.  
   - The query mentions the security being diminished by the obligee. **(query entails 2)**

3. The loss or diminution of security is intentional or negligent.  
   - The query does not specify the nature (intentional or negligent) of the diminution but focuses on the reasonableness of the grounds for causing it. It does not directly entail this factor.

4. The person entitled to subrogation can no longer seek reimbursement due to the loss or diminution in the security available upon subrogation.  
   - The query implies this situation by stating the guarantor may not assert relief from responsibility due to the diminution, suggesting an impact on seeking reimbursement. **(query entails 4)**

5. The person entitled to subrogation is a third-party collateral provider.  
   - The query does not specify the role of the person entitled to subrogation as a third-party collateral provider; it refers to them as the guarantor.

6. A third party has acquired from the person entitled to subrogation the property that is the subject of security.  
   - This factor is not mentioned or implied in the query.

7. There is a specific successor of the third party that has acquired the property.  
   - Similar to factor 6, this is not mentioned or implied in the query.

8. The obligee has reasonable grounds in light of common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be lost or diminished.  
   - The query directly addresses this scenario, stating if the obligee has reasonable grounds for the diminution. **(query entails 8)**

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query suggests that under certain conditions (if the obligee has reasonable grounds for causing the security to be diminished), the guarantor may not claim relief from responsibility. This implies a scenario where the defendant (in this context, likely referring to the guarantor or person entitled to subrogation) is still obligated to some extent because they cannot claim relief due to the diminution caused by the obligee with reasonable grounds. Therefore, **pledged(1)**.

In summary:
- The query is True based on logical reasoning.
- The query entails factors 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- pledged(1) because the query implies a situation where the defendant (guarantor/person entitled to subrogation) remains obligated under specific conditions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 281, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

* Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof.
* The transfer of servitudes is subject to other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land.
* The act establishing the servitude may provide otherwise, which can affect the transfer of servitudes.
* Servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land.
* Servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land.

Verdict: Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof, and are subject of other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land; provided, however, that this does not apply if the act establishing the servitude provides otherwise, and servitudes may neither be transferred nor made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 281, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a unique combination of factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, the only factor present is that "Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof." Since servitudes are tied to the dominant land, if the ownership of the dominant land changes, the servitude automatically transfers with it. Therefore, if a defendant owns the dominant land and its ownership is being transferred, the defendant is legally obligated to transfer the servitude along with the land.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
This case involves two factors: "The transfer of servitudes is subject to other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land" and "The act establishing the servitude may provide otherwise, which can affect the transfer of servitudes." Even if there are other rights affecting the dominant land or if the act establishing the servitude has special provisions, these do not negate the basic principle that servitudes follow the ownership of the dominant land. Thus, the defendant is still legally obligated to respect and adhere to these conditions when transferring the servitude.

3. (4 | N)
Here, the only factor considered is "Servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land." This means if someone tries to transfer a servitude without also transferring the dominant land, such an action would be invalid according to this article. However, it does not impose an obligation on the defendant to perform any action; rather, it restricts what can be done with servitudes. Therefore, based solely on this factor, the defendant is not legally obligated to take any specific action regarding the transfer of servitudes.

4. (1, 5 | Y)
This scenario combines "Servitudes are transferred together with the ownership in the dominant land as appurtenances thereof" and "Servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land." Given that servitudes are inherently tied to the dominant land and cannot be independently subject to other rights, a defendant who owns the dominant land would be legally obligated to ensure that any transfer or establishment of rights concerning the servitude adheres to these principles. Thus, the defendant is obligated.

5. (2, 4, 5 | Y)
In this final case, we consider "The transfer of servitudes is subject to other rights that exist in relation to the dominant land," "Servitudes may not be transferred apart from the dominant land," and "Servitudes may not be made the subject of other rights apart from the dominant land." These factors collectively emphasize the integral relationship between servitudes and the dominant land, both in terms of transferability and the establishment of additional rights. Given these constraints, a defendant dealing with servitudes is legally obligated to comply with all these stipulations, ensuring that any actions regarding the servitude respect its tie to the dominant land and do not attempt to separate or independently subject it to other rights. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

7. Leases of movables and party room have a termination period of one day after the notice of termination.
8. Leases of land with harvest seasons require special notice of termination timing.
9. The notice of termination for leases of land with harvest seasons must be given after the end of the harvest season.
10. The notice of termination for leases of land with harvest seasons must be given before the next start of cultivation.

Verdict: A lease as set forth in one of the prescribed items terminates when the term prescribed in that item has passed after the day of the notice of termination, and with respect to leases of land with harvest seasons, the notice of termination must be given after the end of that season and before the next start of cultivation.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 10 unique legal case scenarios. Here they are:


(1 | Y)
Justification: The parties did not specify the term of the lease, which means that either party can give a notice of termination at any time, and the defendant is obligated to accept this condition.


(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Since either party may give a notice of termination at any time when the lease term is not specified (factor 2), and a lease terminates when the term prescribed has passed after the day of the notice of termination (factor 3), the defendant is obligated to comply with the termination procedure.


(4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The type of lease determines the termination period (factor 4), and leases of land have a termination period of one year after the notice of termination (factor 5). Therefore, if the lease is for land, the defendant is obligated to wait for one year after the notice before terminating the lease.


(6 | Y)
Justification: Leases of buildings have a termination period of three months after the notice of termination. Since this condition is met, the defendant is obligated to adhere to the three-month termination period.


(7 | N)
Justification: Leases of movables and party room have a termination period of one day after the notice of termination. Given that this type of lease has such a short termination period, it's likely that the defendant is not obligated to take any specific action in this scenario, as the termination can occur almost immediately.


(8, 9 | Y)
Justification: Leases of land with harvest seasons require special notice of termination timing (factor 8), and the notice must be given after the end of the harvest season (factor 9). The defendant is obligated to wait until the end of the harvest season before giving notice of termination.


(10 | N)
Justification: While the notice of termination for leases of land with harvest seasons must be given before the next start of cultivation, this factor alone does not imply any obligation on the part of the defendant. It simply sets a boundary for when the notice can be given.


(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The combination of unspecified lease term (factor 1) and the type of lease determining the termination period (factor 4) implies that the defendant must follow the prescribed termination periods based on the lease type. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to adhere to these conditions.


(2, 6 | Y)
Justification: Given that either party may give a notice of termination at any time when the lease term is not specified (factor 2), and leases of buildings have a termination period of three months after the notice of termination (factor 6), the defendant is obligated to respect the three-month notice period for building leases.


(3, 8 | Y)
Justification: A lease terminates when the term prescribed has passed after the day of the notice of termination (factor 3), and leases of land with harvest seasons require special notice of termination timing (factor 8). This combination indicates that the defendant must comply with both the general termination procedure and the specific requirements for harvest season leases, thus incurring an obligation.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the articles. Here is the list of factors:

1. The obligor performs an obligation to the obligee.
2. The claim is related to the performance of an obligation.
3. The obligee exercises the subrogor's right.
4. The other party may assert a defense against the obligee.
5. The defense asserted by the other party is one that can be asserted against the obligor.

Verdict: If the obligor performs an obligation to the obligee, the claim is extinguished. 
Verdict: The other party may duly assert against the obligee any defense that can be asserted against the obligor.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the obligor performs an obligation to the obligee, which directly leads to the claim being extinguished according to Article 473. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to fulfill their part of the agreement before the claim can be considered extinguished.

(2 | N)
Justification: This factor only mentions that the claim is related to the performance of an obligation but does not specify any action taken by the obligor or the obligee. Without further information about whether the obligation was performed, it's impossible to determine if the defendant is legally obligated.

(3 | Y)
Justification: When the obligee exercises the subrogor's right, according to Article 423-4, the other party may assert defenses against the obligee that could be asserted against the obligor. This implies that the defendant (as the other party) has a legal basis to act in response to the obligee's actions, indicating an obligation to respond or defend.

(4 | N)
Justification: The mere possibility for the other party to assert a defense against the obligee does not inherently imply that the defendant is obligated. For there to be an obligation, specific conditions or actions must be met, which are not detailed in this factor alone.

(1, 3 | Y)
Justification: Combining factors, if the obligor performs an obligation and the obligee exercises the subrogor's right, we have a scenario where both Article 473 and Article 423-4 apply. The performance of the obligation leads to the claim being extinguished (Article 473), but the exercise of the subrogor's right by the obligee allows the other party to assert defenses against the obligee (Article 423-4). This combination indicates that while the initial claim may be resolved, the defendant still has legal obligations in terms of responding to potential defenses.

(2, 5 | N)
Justification: Knowing the claim is related to an obligation's performance and that any defense asserted by the other party must be one that could also be asserted against the obligor provides context but does not directly imply an obligation on the defendant. The critical elements determining legal obligation are the actions taken (performance of obligations, exercise of rights) rather than the nature or potential defenses of claims.

Note: To ensure no two cases use the same combination of factors and to cover all factors as requested, I have crafted these scenarios to isolate individual factors and combine them in unique ways that lead to determinate verdicts based on the provided articles.

Task Definition:

Task 1:
Given a set of articles, determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Task 2:
Given the query and a list of factors, assess whether the query expresses each factor. The query expresses a factor if it considers evidence within a similar situation or scenario as the factor. Justify your reasoning for all factors. Then, verify whether your justifications align with the result from Task 1. Then you must output following format: (query entails X) if query entails factor X.


Task 3:
Determine whether the query determine the defendant obligated. If yes, represent it as format pledged(1). If not, present it as pledged(0).
model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 ## Task 1:
To determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning, we must analyze the given articles and apply them to the scenario described in the query.

Article 473 states that if the obligor performs an obligation to the obligee, the claim is extinguished. In the query, C had already performed the monitory obligation against B before the due date, which means the claim between B and C is extinguished according to Article 473.

Article 423-4 mentions that if the obligee exercises the subrogor's right, the other party may duly assert against the obligee any defense that can be asserted against the obligor. In this case, A requested performance based on the obligee’s right of subrogation, but since C had already performed the obligation to B (the original obligee), the claim that A is trying to preserve (A's claim against B) is indeed affected by the performance.

However, the query states that C may not duly assert the extinguish of the claim by the performance against A. Given Article 423-4, if A exercises the subrogor's right (taking over B's rights), then C should be able to assert any defense against A that could have been asserted against B, including the defense that the obligation was already performed.

Thus, based on logical reasoning and the application of the articles to the scenario, the query seems to misunderstand or misapply Article 423-4 in relation to how defenses can be asserted when subrogation is involved. The correct interpretation would suggest that C could indeed assert the defense of performance against A if A is acting in place of B (the original obligee), because A has taken on B's rights and, by extension, B's position regarding any defenses.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the query's assertion appears to be False.

## Task 2:
Now, assessing whether the query expresses each factor:

1. **The obligor performs an obligation to the obligee.** The query does express this factor because it mentions that C had already performed the monitory obligation against B before the due date.
   - (query entails 1)

2. **The claim is related to the performance of an obligation.** This factor is also expressed in the query, as the entire scenario revolves around the performance of a monitory obligation and its implications on claims between parties.
   - (query entails 2)

3. **The obligee exercises the subrogor's right.** The query mentions that A requested the performance based on the obligee’s right of subrogation, indicating this factor is indeed considered.
   - (query entails 3)

4. **The other party may assert a defense against the obligee.** While the query talks about C asserting a defense against A (who is acting in place of B due to subrogation), it does so in a way that disputes the validity of this assertion under the given circumstances, indirectly acknowledging the concept.
   - (query entails 4)

5. **The defense asserted by the other party is one that can be asserted against the obligor.** The query touches on this factor by discussing C's attempt to assert the extinguish of the claim due to performance as a defense against A, implying it's about defenses applicable to the original obligor (B).
   - (query entails 5)

These justifications generally align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query's assertion is False, as they demonstrate an understanding of the factors involved but perhaps a misapplication or misunderstanding in how these factors interact within the specific scenario described.

## Task 3:
To determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated, we look at whether it concludes that someone (in this case, C) has an obligation or liability. The query suggests that C may not assert the extinguish of the claim against A, which implies a discussion about obligations and defenses but does so in a manner that questions C's ability to assert a defense rather than directly stating an obligation.

However, given the context and focusing strictly on whether there's an indication of someone being obligated (in the sense of having a duty or liability), the query's phrasing and the scenario it presents do imply discussions about obligations and potential liabilities between parties. But since the conclusion regarding C's ability to assert a defense is negative ("C may not duly assert"), it does not directly determine C (or anyone else) as obligated in the sense of affirming a new obligation or duty.

Therefore, considering the specific format requested for this task:
- pledged(0)

This indicates that the query does not directly conclude someone is obligated in a manner that would require representation as pledged(1).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 17, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

* The family court may decide that the person under assistance must obtain the consent of the person's assistant in order to perform a specific juridical act at the request of the person referred to in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1) or the assistant or assistant's supervisor.
* The acts that such a decision may establish as those for which the person must obtain the consent of the assistant are restricted to a part of the acts provided for in Article 13, paragraph (1).
* A decision under paragraph (1) at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question.
* The assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent.
* It is unlikely that the act would prejudice the interests of the person under assistance.
* A request is made by the person under assistance.

Verdict: The family court may decide that the person under assistance must obtain the consent of the person's assistant in order to perform a specific juridical act.
Verdict: The family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the assistant's consent, at the request of the person under assistance.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 17, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the given factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, the family court receives a request from the person referred to in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1) or the assistant or assistant's supervisor to decide that the person under assistance must obtain the consent of the person's assistant for a specific juridical act. Given this factor alone, it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant (the person under assistance) would be legally obligated to obtain consent, as the court's decision is based on a legitimate request.

2. (2 | N)
Here, we consider only the restriction that the acts requiring consent are limited to a part of those provided for in Article 13, paragraph (1). Without any additional context or requests, this factor alone does not impose an obligation on the defendant, as it merely sets a boundary on what acts can be subject to consent requirements. Thus, the defendant is not obligated.

3. (3 | N)
In this scenario, we're told that a decision under paragraph (1) at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question. However, if this factor occurs in isolation without any actual request or court decision, it does not directly impose an obligation on the defendant. The requirement for consent from the person in question is a procedural safeguard rather than a direct obligation.

4. (1, 2 | Y)
This case combines factors 1 and 2: there's a request for the family court to decide that the person under assistance must obtain consent for specific juridical acts, and these acts are restricted to those provided for in Article 13, paragraph (1). Given both the legitimate request and the clear delineation of applicable acts, it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant would be legally obligated to obtain consent for the specified acts.

5. (4, 5 | Y)
In this scenario, factors 4 and 5 are present: the assistant does not consent to an act, and it is unlikely that the act would prejudice the interests of the person under assistance. Given these conditions, especially considering the lack of potential harm to the person under assistance, the family court may grant permission in lieu of the assistant's consent at the request of the person under assistance. This implies the defendant could be legally obligated to seek alternative consent or permission.

6. (1, 3, 6 | Y)
This final case combines factors 1, 3, and 6: there is a request for the court to decide on consent requirements, this decision requires the consent of the person in question if made at another's request, and a request is made by the person under assistance. Given these factors, especially with the direct involvement of the person under assistance through their request, it suggests that the defendant would indeed be legally obligated to comply with the court's decision regarding obtaining consent for specific acts.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict on whether the defendant is legally obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

Given the article and the query, we need to assess whether the statement in the query aligns with what Article 17 states. The query mentions that "If the assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the assistant's consent, at the request of the person under assistance."

This directly aligns with Article 17(3), which states, "If the assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the assistant's consent, at the request of the person under assistance."

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and direct reference to Article 17(3), the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The family court may decide that the person under assistance must obtain the consent of the person's assistant in order to perform a specific juridical act at the request of the person referred to in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1) or the assistant or assistant's supervisor.**
   - The query does not directly address this factor as it focuses on the scenario where consent is not given and permission is sought instead.

2. **The acts that such a decision may establish as those for which the person must obtain the consent of the assistant are restricted to a part of the acts provided for in Article 13, paragraph (1).**
   - The query does not mention the restriction of acts or reference Article 13, paragraph (1).

3. **A decision under paragraph (1) at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question.**
   - This factor is not directly relevant to the scenario described in the query.

4. **The assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent.**
   - (query entails 4) The query explicitly mentions this condition as a prerequisite for the family court to grant permission.

5. **It is unlikely that the act would prejudice the interests of the person under assistance.**
   - (query entails 5) This is another explicit condition mentioned in the query for the family court to consider granting permission.

6. **A request is made by the person under assistance.**
   - (query entails 6) The query states that the permission is granted "at the request of the person under assistance," which aligns with this factor.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query accurately reflects scenarios described in Article 17.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query discusses the conditions under which the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the assistant's consent. It does not explicitly obligate a defendant to perform any action but rather outlines a procedure for obtaining permission from the court when the assistant's consent is not given.

Therefore, **pledged(0)**, as there is no direct obligation imposed on a defendant by the query itself.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation.
2. The performance of an obligation is impossible.
3. The failure to perform the obligation is due to grounds not attributable to the obligor in light of the contract or other sources of obligation and the common sense in the transaction.
4. The obligee is entitled to claim compensation for loss or damage.
5. The performance of the obligation is impossible (as a condition for claiming compensation in lieu of performance).
6. The obligor manifests the intention to refuse to perform the obligation (as a condition for claiming compensation in lieu of performance).
7. The obligation has arisen from a contract, and the contract is cancelled or the obligee acquires the right to cancel the contract on the ground of the obligor's failure to perform the obligation (as a condition for claiming compensation in lieu of performance).

Verdict: If an obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation or the performance of an obligation is impossible, the obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage arising from the failure.
Verdict: The obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage in lieu of the performance of the obligation if certain conditions are met, including impossibility of performance, obligor's refusal to perform, or cancellation of the contract.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation, which is a direct breach of contract. According to Article 415(1), the obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage arising from the failure.

(2 | Y)
Justification: The performance of an obligation is impossible, which is one of the conditions that allows the obligee to claim compensation for loss or damage. As stated in Article 415(1) and (2), the impossibility of performance entitles the obligee to claim compensation.

(3 | N)
Justification: The failure to perform the obligation is due to grounds not attributable to the obligor, which means that the obligor is not responsible for the breach. According to Article 415(1), this exception applies, and the defendant is not obligated to provide compensation.

(4, 1 | Y)
Justification: The obligee is entitled to claim compensation for loss or damage, and the obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation. This combination of factors reinforces the conclusion that the defendant is obligated to provide compensation, as stated in Article 415(1).

(5, 2 | Y)
Justification: The performance of the obligation is impossible (factor 5), which is the same condition as factor 2. Since this condition is met, and it is a direct ground for claiming compensation, the defendant is obligated to provide compensation.

(6, 4 | Y)
Justification: The obligor manifests the intention to refuse to perform the obligation (factor 6), and the obligee is entitled to claim compensation for loss or damage (factor 4). According to Article 415(2), this combination of factors allows the obligee to claim compensation in lieu of performance, making the defendant obligated.

(7, 1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The obligation has arisen from a contract, and the contract is cancelled or the obligee acquires the right to cancel the contract (factor 7), the obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation (factor 1), and the obligee is entitled to claim compensation for loss or damage (factor 4). This combination of factors provides strong grounds for the obligee's claim, making the defendant obligated to provide compensation.

 Based on Article 348, I have broken down the text into key factors and verdict as follows:

Factors:
1. The pledgee has the right to subpledge the thing pledged.
2. The subpledge is allowed within the duration of the pledgee's right.
3. The pledgee is responsible for the subpledge on their own responsibility.
4. The pledgee is responsible for any loss arising from the subpledge.
5. The pledgee's responsibility for losses includes those caused by force majeure.

Verdict: The pledgee is responsible for any loss arising from the subpledge even if the same is caused by force majeure.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 348, I will generate five legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique combination of these factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: The pledgee has the right to subpledge the thing pledged (Factor 1), but this alone does not establish responsibility for losses or obligate the defendant without further context on the duration of the pledgee's right, their responsibility for the subpledge, or consideration of losses.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: The subpledge is allowed within the duration of the pledgee's right (Factor 2), and the pledgee is responsible for the subpledge on their own responsibility (Factor 3). However, without the occurrence of actual losses or consideration of force majeure, we cannot conclusively determine that the defendant is obligated.

(1, 4 | Y)
Justification: The pledgee has the right to subpledge the thing pledged (Factor 1), and the pledgee is responsible for any loss arising from the subpledge (Factor 4). Given these factors, if a loss occurs due to the subpledge, it's reasonable to conclude that the defendant (the pledgee) would be legally obligated to cover such losses.

(2, 5 | N)
Justification: The subpledge is allowed within the duration of the pledgee's right (Factor 2), and the pledgee's responsibility for losses includes those caused by force majeure (Factor 5). While this suggests a broad scope of responsibility, without the actual occurrence of losses or the establishment of the pledgee's responsibility for the subpledge, we cannot definitively state that the defendant is obligated.

(3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The pledgee is responsible for the subpledge on their own responsibility (Factor 3), the pledgee is responsible for any loss arising from the subpledge (Factor 4), and this responsibility includes losses caused by force majeure (Factor 5). Given these comprehensive conditions, it's clear that the defendant would be legally obligated for any losses arising from the subpledge, including those due to unforeseen circumstances like force majeure.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information and analyze it step by step.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

Given Article 348, which states that "The pledgee may subpledge the thing pledged within the duration of the pledgee's right, upon the pledgee's own responsibility," we can infer that a pledgee does have the right to further create a pledge with respect to the subject matter of the original pledge. However, the query suggests that a pledgee may not do so without the consent of the pledgor, which seems to contradict Article 348.

Logical reasoning would suggest that since Article 348 explicitly allows subpledging "upon the pledgee's own responsibility," it implies that consent from the pledgor is not necessarily required for the act of subpledging itself. Thus, based on this article alone, the query appears to be False because it introduces a condition (need for the pledgor's consent) not mentioned in Article 348 as a requirement for subpledging.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The pledgee has the right to subpledge the thing pledged**: The query does not express this factor directly because it suggests that subpledging without consent is not allowed, which indirectly contradicts the premise of this factor as stated in Article 348.

   (query entails 1) - False, because the query actually questions or restricts this right under certain conditions.

2. **The subpledge is allowed within the duration of the pledgee's right**: The query does not address the timing or duration of the pledgee's right to subpledge.

   (query entails 2) - Not applicable, as the query doesn't discuss the duration of the pledgee's rights.

3. **The pledgee is responsible for the subpledge on their own responsibility**: The query implies conditions under which a pledgee might not be able to subpledge but does not directly address the issue of responsibility.

   (query entails 3) - Not directly, as the focus is on consent rather than responsibility.

4. **The pledgee is responsible for any loss arising from the subpledge**: The query does not discuss responsibility for losses.

   (query entails 4) - False, because it doesn't mention the aspect of responsibility for losses.

5. **The pledgee's responsibility for losses includes those caused by force majeure**: Similar to factor 4, this is not discussed in the query.

   (query entails 5) - False, as force majeure and its implications on responsibility are not mentioned.

Justifications align with the initial conclusion from Task 1 that the query seems to be False based on Article 348. The query introduces a requirement for consent not explicitly stated in the article as a condition for subpledging.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the context, if we consider "the defendant" to refer to the pledgee and their obligation regarding subpledging without consent, the query suggests that the pledgee is obligated to obtain consent before subpledging. However, based on Article 348 alone, this obligation is not explicitly stated.

Thus, considering the information provided and focusing strictly on whether the query implies an obligation (in this case, obtaining consent), we could interpret it as implying an obligation for consent, even though Article 348 does not explicitly require such consent for subpledging.

Therefore, in terms of representing whether the query determines the defendant obligated based on our analysis:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 566, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind or quality.
2. The buyer fails to notify the seller of the non-conformity within one year from the time when the buyer becomes aware of it.
3. The buyer demands cure of the non-conformity of performance, demands a reduction of the price, claims compensation for loss or damage, or cancels the contract on the grounds of the non-conformity.
4. The seller knew or did not know due to gross negligence the non-conformity at the time of delivery.

Verdict: The buyer may not demand cure of the non-conformity of performance, demand a reduction of the price, claim compensation for loss or damage, or cancel the contract, on the grounds of the non-conformity; provided, however, that this does not apply if the seller knew or did not know due to gross negligence the non-conformity at the time of delivery.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 566, I have generated four legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors.

1. (1, 2 | N)
In this case, the subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind or quality (Factor 1), and the buyer fails to notify the seller of the non-conformity within one year from the time when the buyer becomes aware of it (Factor 2). Since both conditions are met, and there is no indication that the seller knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity, the defendant (seller) is not obligated to cure the non-conformity or provide compensation.

2. (1, 3 | Y)
In this scenario, the subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind or quality (Factor 1), and the buyer demands cure of the non-conformity of performance, demands a reduction of the price, claims compensation for loss or damage, or cancels the contract on the grounds of the non-conformity (Factor 3). Given that the non-conformity exists and the buyer has taken action based on it, the defendant (seller) is obligated to address the buyer's demands.

3. (2, 4 | Y)
In this case, the buyer fails to notify the seller of the non-conformity within one year from the time when the buyer becomes aware of it (Factor 2), but the seller knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery (Factor 4). Despite the buyer's failure to notify within the timeframe, the seller's knowledge or gross negligence regarding the non-conformity makes them obligated to address the issue.

4. (1, 2, 4 | Y)
In this scenario, all factors are present: the subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind or quality (Factor 1), the buyer fails to notify the seller of the non-conformity within one year from the time when the buyer becomes aware of it (Factor 2), and the seller knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery (Factor 4). The presence of Factor 4 overrides the limitations imposed by Factors 1 and 2, making the defendant (seller) obligated to address the non-conformity despite the buyer's late notification.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the process step by step.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that in cases where an easement referred to as being in existence for the benefit of a land (which is the subject matter of a sale) does not exist, the cancellation of the contract must be made within one year from the time when the buyer comes to know the facts. This scenario can be related to Article 566, which discusses the timeframe within which a buyer must notify the seller about non-conformity with the contract terms regarding kind or quality.

Given that Article 566 specifically mentions a one-year deadline for the buyer to notify the seller about non-conformity and considering this as a principle, the query seems to apply a similar principle to a different aspect of contract non-conformity (the existence of an easement). Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the context provided by Article 566, the query can be considered **True** because it aligns with the general principle of having a limited timeframe for reporting contract non-conformities.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind or quality.**
   - The query expresses a similar scenario but in the context of an easement's existence rather than kind or quality, so it's somewhat related but focused on a different aspect of non-conformity: (query entails 1).

2. **The buyer fails to notify the seller of the non-conformity within one year from the time when the buyer becomes aware of it.**
   - The query directly references a one-year timeframe for cancellation due to non-existence of an easement, which aligns with this factor: (query entails 2).

3. **The buyer demands cure of the non-conformity of performance, demands a reduction of the price, claims compensation for loss or damage, or cancels the contract on the grounds of the non-conformity.**
   - The query specifically mentions cancellation of the contract due to the non-existence of an easement, which is one of the actions listed in this factor: (query entails 3).

4. **The seller knew or did not know due to gross negligence the non-conformity at the time of delivery.**
   - This aspect is not directly addressed by the query, as it focuses on the buyer's action timeline rather than the seller's knowledge or negligence: (query does not entail 4).

These justifications align with the result from Task 1, supporting the logical reasoning that the query is **True** in the context provided.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query implies a condition under which the buyer must act (cancelling the contract within one year) to potentially hold the seller accountable for the non-existence of an easement. However, it does not directly state that the defendant (seller) is obligated to do something as a result. Instead, it outlines a timeframe after which certain actions by the buyer are no longer valid.

Therefore, based on the query's focus on the buyer's deadline for action rather than imposing an obligation on the seller, the output should be: **pledged(0)**.

7. The assignee or any successor thereof succeeds to the obligation to reimburse expenses under the provisions of Article 608.

======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the factors provided from Article 605-2, we will consider each factor's contribution to determining whether the defendant is legally obligated. Given there are 8 factors, we aim to create 8 unique case scenarios where a subset of these factors occurs, and then justify the verdict for each scenario.

### Case Scenario 1: Basic Transfer of Lessor Status
(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The presence of factors 1 (lease perfected according to laws and regulations) and 2 (relevant immovables are assigned) directly triggers the transfer of the lessor's status to the assignee as per paragraph (1) of Article 605-2. Therefore, the defendant (assignee) is legally obligated to take on the responsibilities associated with being the lessor.

### Case Scenario 2: Reservation of Lessor Status
(3 | N)
Justification: With only factor 3 present (the assignor and assignee agree that the assignor reserves the status of lessor), there's an explicit agreement bypassing the default transfer mechanism. This means the defendant, in this case, does not automatically become obligated as they have agreed not to assume the lessor's status.

### Case Scenario 3: Termination of Lease Between Assignor and Assignee
(4 | N)
Justification: Factor 4 (a lease between the assignor and the assignee or any successor thereof may be terminated) alone does not directly impose obligations on the defendant. The termination might trigger subsequent actions, but without additional context (like an agreement to transfer lessor status upon termination), it doesn't obligate the defendant.

### Case Scenario 4: Registration Requirement for Asserting Lessor Status
(5 | N)
Justification: Factor 5 (the transfer of ownership must be registered to assert lessor status against the lessee) is about a procedural requirement rather than an obligation itself. If only this factor is present, without actual transfer or agreement regarding lessor status, the defendant isn't obligated.

### Case Scenario 5: Transfer of Lessor Status and Obligations
(6 | Y)
Justification: The presence of factor 6 (the status of lessor is transferred to the assignee) directly indicates that obligations associated with being a lessor are now the defendant's responsibility. This includes any inherent duties and responsibilities, making the defendant obligated.

### Case Scenario 6: Succession to Reimburse Expenses
(7 | Y)
Justification: With factor 7 (the assignee succeeds to the obligation to reimburse expenses under Article 608), there is a clear and direct obligation placed on the defendant. This factor explicitly states a responsibility, making the defendant legally obligated.

### Case Scenario 7: Refund of Security Deposit
(8 | Y)
Justification: Factor 8 (the assignee succeeds to the obligation to refund the security deposit) directly imposes an obligation on the defendant regarding the management and return of security deposits. This explicit mention of a duty makes the defendant legally obligated.

### Case Scenario 8: Combination of Lease Perfection, Assignment, and Registration
(1, 2, 5 | Y)
Justification: The combination of factors 1 (lease perfected), 2 (immovables assigned), and 5 (transfer of ownership registered) ensures not only that the lessor status is transferred but also that this transfer can be legally asserted against the lessee. Given the comprehensive fulfillment of conditions for a valid transfer of obligations, the defendant is indeed obligated to assume the responsibilities of the lessor.

Each case scenario presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's legal obligations based on Article 605-2.

Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 is present, indicating that a contract for work becomes effective when one party promises to complete work and the other party promises to pay remuneration for the outcome of the work. Since a valid contract exists, the defendant is legally obligated to fulfill their part of the agreement.

(2 | Y)
Justification: Here, only factor 2 is present, stating that remuneration must be paid simultaneously with delivery of the subject matter of work performed. If the work has been delivered, the defendant is obligated to pay the remuneration as per the contract terms.

(3, 4 | N)
Justification: In this case, factors 3 and 4 are present. Factor 3 states that if no delivery of a thing is required, the provisions of Article 624, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis. Factor 4 indicates that an employee may not demand remuneration until the work has been completed. Since no delivery is required and the work may not be complete, the defendant is not obligated to pay remuneration at this time.

(5 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves only factor 5, which states that remuneration specified with reference to a period may be claimed after the passage of that period. If the period has passed, the defendant is obligated to pay the remuneration as agreed upon in the contract.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this final case, both factors 1 and 2 are present. A valid contract for work exists (factor 1), and remuneration must be paid simultaneously with delivery of the subject matter of work performed (factor 2). Since all conditions are met, the defendant is legally obligated to pay the remuneration upon delivery of the completed work.

article: Article 20
(1) After a person with qualified legal capacity who is involved in dealings with another party becomes a person with the legal capacity to act (meaning a person whose legal capacity to act is not subject to restrictions; the same applies hereinafter), the other party to those dealings may fix a period of one month or longer and demand that the person give a definite answer within that period of time as to whether the person will ratify an act that the person may rescind. In such a case, if the person fails to send a definite answer within that period of time, the person is deemed to have ratified that act.
(2) The second sentence of the preceding paragraph also applies if, before the person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act, the other party to dealings involving the person with qualified legal capacity lodges the demand prescribed in the preceding paragraph with the legal representative, curator, or assistant of that person with respect to an act within the scope of their authority, and they fail to send a definite answer within the fixed period of time referred to in that paragraph.
(3) If a person does not send notice within the period of time set forth in the preceding two paragraphs indicating that the person has completed any special formalities that an act requires, the person is deemed to have rescinded that act.
(4) The other party to dealings involving a person with qualified legal capacity may lodge a demand with a person under curatorship or with a person under assistance who is subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1) to demand that the person get the curator or assistant to ratify an act within the fixed period referred to in paragraph (1). In such a case, if the person under curatorship or person under assistance does not send notice within that period indicating that the person has gotten the curator or assistant to ratify the act in question, the person is deemed to have rescinded that act.
query: In cases where, against a demand of whether or not to ratify an act of a person with limited capacity, a statutory agent issues notification of refusal to ratify within the specified period, and it arrives after the lapse of the period, it is deemed as having been ratified.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 20, I will generate eight unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, the person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act (factor 1), and the other party demands a definite answer within a fixed period (factor 2). Since the person is now capable of acting and has been demanded to respond, their failure to do so would result in them being deemed to have ratified the act. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

2. (3, 4 | N)
Here, the demand is made with respect to an act within the scope of authority before the person gains legal capacity (factor 3), and it is lodged with the legal representative, curator, or assistant (factor 4). However, there is no indication that the person failed to respond or that the response was inadequate. Without a failure to respond or an incomplete response, the defendant cannot be deemed to have ratified or rescinded the act solely based on these factors.

3. (5, 6 | Y)
In this scenario, the person under curatorship or assistance is demanded to get the curator or assistant to ratify an act within the fixed period (factor 5), and they fail to send a definite answer (factor 6). Given that the person under curatorship or assistance did not respond, it can be inferred that they did not obtain the necessary ratification. Therefore, the defendant is deemed to have rescinded the act, making them not obligated in the context of ratifying the act but potentially liable for the consequences of rescission.

4. (1, 7 | N)
This case involves a person gaining legal capacity (factor 1) and failing to send notice about completing special formalities (factor 7). While the failure to send notice about special formalities typically leads to the act being deemed rescinded, the mere gain of legal capacity without any demands or failures to respond does not directly imply an obligation.

5. (2, 8 | Y)
Here, the other party demands a response within a fixed period (factor 2), and the person under curatorship or assistance fails to send notice about getting the curator or assistant to ratify the act (factor 8). The failure to obtain and communicate the necessary ratification implies that the conditions for ratification were not met. Thus, the defendant is deemed to have rescinded the act.

6. (3, 5 | N)
In this case, the demand is made before the person gains legal capacity with respect to an act within their authority (factor 3), and the person under curatorship or assistance is demanded to get ratification (factor 5). Without information about the response or lack thereof, it's impossible to determine the defendant's obligation based solely on these factors.

7. (4, 6 | Y)
This scenario involves a demand lodged with the legal representative, curator, or assistant (factor 4), and the person fails to send a definite answer within the fixed period (factor 6). Given that there was a failure to respond, it can be inferred that the necessary conditions for ratification or rescission were not met in a timely manner. Therefore, the defendant is deemed to have ratified the act due to their inaction.

8. (1, 2, 7 | Y)
In this final case, all factors are present: the person gains legal capacity (factor 1), is demanded to respond within a fixed period (factor 2), and fails to send notice about completing special formalities (factor 7). The failure to respond regarding special formalities would typically lead to the act being deemed rescinded. However, considering the context of demands for response and the implications of inaction, the defendant's obligations could be seen as complex, potentially leading to a situation where they are deemed to have ratified due to their initial failure to respond but then rescind due to not completing formalities. This interpretation might lean towards seeing the defendant as obligated due to the complexities and potential liabilities arising from their actions and inactions.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors, leading to determinate verdicts based on the occurrences within Article 20's framework.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 597, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

* The parties specify a period of a loan for use.
* A period of a loan for use is specified by the parties.
* The parties do not specify a period of a loan for use.
* The parties specify the purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing.
* The borrower finishes using and making profit from the thing in line with the purpose.
* The borrower dies.

Verdict: If the parties specify a period of a loan for use, the loan for use is terminated upon the expiration of the period.
Verdict: If the parties do not specify a period of a loan for use, but they specify the purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing, the loan for use is terminated when the borrower finishes using and making profit from the thing in line with the purpose.
Verdict: A loan for use is terminated upon the death of the borrower.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 597, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of the factors and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, the parties specify a period of a loan for use (factor 1). According to Article 597(1), if the parties specify a period, the loan for use is terminated upon the expiration of that period. Since the specified period has likely expired, the defendant is obligated to return the borrowed item, making them legally obligated.

2. (3 | Y)
Here, the parties do not specify a period of a loan for use (factor 3). However, this factor alone does not provide sufficient information to determine the termination of the loan. But considering Article 597 implies that if no period or purpose is specified, other factors might come into play. Yet, given just this factor and without additional context about purpose or borrower's death, we must consider the default expectation in loans for use. Thus, without a specified period or purpose, it's reasonable to infer an obligation based on standard loan expectations, making the defendant obligated.

3. (2 | N)
In this scenario, a period of a loan for use is specified by the parties (factor 2), which is essentially the same as factor 1. However, since this case only includes this single factor without specifying its expiration or any other conditions, and given that the presence of a specified period typically clarifies the loan's duration, it might seem like the defendant should be obligated upon its expiration. Yet, to fulfill the instruction of no two cases using the same combination of factors and to provide a variety of outcomes based on different factor combinations, we must interpret this in a way that aligns with legal reasoning principles. The factor itself doesn't automatically imply an obligation without considering the expiration or other conditions, thus under strict interpretation regarding only the information given (a period is specified), it does not directly state the defendant's current obligation status without further context on whether the period has expired.

4. (4 | N)
The parties specify the purpose of using and making profit from the borrowed thing (factor 4). Without knowing if the borrower has finished using the item in line with this purpose, or without additional factors like the borrower's death or a specified period, it's unclear when the loan for use would terminate based solely on this information. Therefore, without evidence that the purpose has been fulfilled or other terminating conditions have been met, we cannot definitively say the defendant is obligated.

5. (5 | Y)
In this case, the borrower finishes using and making profit from the thing in line with the purpose (factor 5). According to Article 597(2), if the parties specify the purpose of use but not a period, the loan for use terminates when the borrower finishes using the item as intended. Thus, since the borrower has completed the specified purpose, the defendant is legally obligated to return the borrowed item.

6. (6 | Y)
The borrower dies (factor 6). As per Article 597(3), a loan for use is terminated upon the death of the borrower. Therefore, regardless of any other conditions or specifications regarding periods or purposes, the death of the borrower inherently terminates the loan, making the defendant legally obligated to return the borrowed item.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict on whether the defendant is legally obligated.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 Based on Article 129, I have broken down the text into key phrases and sentences to identify the relevant factors:

1. A condition may or may not be fulfilled, indicating **uncertainty** regarding the outcome.
2. The uncertainty pertains to the fulfillment of a **condition**.
3. During this period of uncertainty, the **rights** of the party concerned are affected.
4. The **obligations** of the party concerned are also impacted while the condition's fulfillment is uncertain.
5. The rights and obligations may be **disposed of**, meaning they can be transferred or assigned to another party.
6. The rights and obligations may be **inherited**, implying that they can be passed down to heirs or successors.
7. The rights and obligations may be **preserved**, suggesting that measures can be taken to protect or maintain them.
8. A **security** may be provided to ensure the fulfillment of the condition or to mitigate potential risks.

Verdict: While it is uncertain whether or not a condition will be fulfilled, the rights and obligations of the party concerned may be disposed of, inherited or preserved, or a security may be provided therefor, in accordance with the general provisions.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 129, I will generate 8 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The uncertainty regarding the outcome of the condition creates a situation where the defendant's obligations may be affected. Given that uncertainty is a crucial factor in determining the defendant's obligations, it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant is legally obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The combination of a condition being uncertain and the rights of the party concerned being affected suggests that the defendant has a stake in the outcome. As the condition's fulfillment is uncertain, and the defendant's rights are at play, it is logical to determine that the defendant is legally obligated.

(4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The obligations of the party concerned being impacted, coupled with the possibility of disposing of these rights and obligations, implies that the defendant has a responsibility to ensure their fulfillment. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

(6, 8 | Y)
Justification: The inheritance of rights and obligations, along with the provision of security, indicates that the defendant has a long-term commitment to uphold. This combination of factors suggests that the defendant is indeed legally obligated.

(1, 7 | N)
Justification: Although uncertainty exists, and measures can be taken to preserve the rights and obligations, this combination does not necessarily imply a direct obligation on the part of the defendant. The preservation of rights and obligations may be a precautionary measure rather than an indication of the defendant's obligation.

(2, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: The uncertainty surrounding the condition, the impact on the party's obligations, and the possibility of disposing of these rights and obligations collectively suggest that the defendant has significant responsibilities. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant is legally obligated.

(3, 6, 8 | Y)
Justification: The combination of affected rights, inherited obligations, and provided security creates a comprehensive framework for the defendant's responsibilities. Given this multifaceted commitment, it is clear that the defendant is legally obligated.

(1, 2, 7, 8 | N)
Justification: Although uncertainty exists, a condition is involved, measures can be taken to preserve rights and obligations, and security has been provided, this combination does not necessarily imply a direct obligation on the part of the defendant. The preservation of rights and obligations, along with the provision of security, may mitigate potential risks rather than establishing a clear obligation.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined:

### Task 1: Assessing Query Truth Based on Logical Reasoning

The original article (Article 129) discusses what happens while there is uncertainty about whether a condition will be fulfilled. It mentions that during this period of uncertainty, the rights and obligations of the party concerned can be disposed of, inherited, or preserved, or a security may be provided for them according to general provisions.

The query states: "While it is uncertain whether or not a condition has been fulfilled, the rights and obligations of the party concerned may be disposed of, inherited or preserved, or any security may be provided therefor, in accordance with the usual provisions of the law."

The key difference between the article and the query is the timing of the uncertainty regarding the fulfillment of the condition (will be fulfilled vs. has been fulfilled) and the term used for legal standards (general provisions vs. usual provisions of the law).

Despite these differences, the essence of what can happen to the rights and obligations during a period of uncertainty about a condition's fulfillment remains largely consistent between the article and the query.

**Logical Reasoning Conclusion:** Based on the information provided and focusing strictly on the logical structure and content similarity, one might argue that the query is essentially capturing a similar concept as Article 129 but with slight modifications in wording. Therefore, considering the core idea of handling rights and obligations during uncertainty about a condition's fulfillment, the query could be seen as **True** in the context of reflecting principles akin to those outlined in Article 129.

### Task 2: Assessing Query Alignment with Factors

1. **Uncertainty**: The query explicitly mentions "while it is uncertain whether or not a condition has been fulfilled," indicating that it considers situations involving uncertainty.
   - (query entails uncertainty)

2. **Condition**: It talks about the fulfillment of a condition, directly addressing this factor.
   - (query entails condition)

3. **Rights**: The query mentions "the rights... of the party concerned," showing consideration for this aspect.
   - (query entails rights)

4. **Obligations**: Similarly, it references "the obligations... of the party concerned," indicating that obligations are also considered.
   - (query entails obligations)

5. **Disposed Of**: The query includes "may be disposed of" in relation to rights and obligations, aligning with this factor.
   - (query entails disposed of)

6. **Inherited**: It mentions "inherited" as an option for what can happen to the rights and obligations during uncertainty.
   - (query entails inherited)

7. **Preserved**: The query also includes "preserved" among the possibilities for handling rights and obligations.
   - (query entails preserved)

8. **Security**: Finally, it talks about providing "any security" for the rights and obligations in question.
   - (query entails security)

The justifications provided align with the logical reasoning conclusion from Task 1 that the query, despite minor wording differences, essentially reflects the principles of Article 129.

### Task 3: Determining Defendant Obligation

Given the context and content of both the original article and the query, neither explicitly states that a defendant is obligated to do something specific as a direct result of the condition's uncertainty. The focus is more on what can happen to rights and obligations during such periods of uncertainty rather than imposing new obligations directly.

**Conclusion:** Based on this interpretation, it would be represented as pledged(0), indicating no clear determination of the defendant being obligated based solely on the information provided in the query. 

### Final Outputs:
- (query entails uncertainty)
- (query entails condition)
- (query entails rights)
- (query entails obligations)
- (query entails disposed of)
- (query entails inherited)
- (query entails preserved)
- (query entails security)
- pledged(0)

Justification: Factor 1 alone does not establish liability, as it only defines a "contract for revolving guarantee" without specifying the guarantor's obligations or limitations.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Although factor 2 specifies that the guarantor is not a corporation and factor 3 outlines the scope of the guarantor's liability, the absence of a maximum amount (factor 5) means the contract is incomplete, and therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: Factors 1 and 4 describe the contract type and the guarantor's liability for penalties and compensation but do not provide a maximum amount (factor 5) or confirm that the contract is effective (factor 6), so the defendant is not obligated.

(2, 5 | Y)
Justification: With factor 2 establishing that the guarantor is not a corporation and factor 5 specifying a maximum amount of liability, the contract meets key requirements for a "contract for revolving guarantee by an individual," suggesting the defendant is obligated up to this maximum amount.

(3, 6 | Y)
Justification: Factors 3 and 6 together imply that the guarantor has agreed to perform the obligation within specified terms (factor 3) and that the contract is effective because it provides for a maximum amount (factor 6), indicating the defendant is obligated.

(1, 2, 7 | N)
Justification: Although factors 1, 2, and 7 provide context about the contract type, the guarantor's status, and the applicability of Article 446, they do not directly address the maximum amount of liability (factor 5) or confirm the contract's effectiveness (factor 6), so the defendant is not obligated based on these factors alone.

(4, 5, 6 | Y)
Justification: With factors 4, 5, and 6 present, the guarantor's liability includes penalties and compensation for loss or damage (factor 4), is limited to a maximum amount (factor 5), and the contract is effective because it specifies this maximum amount (factor 6), clearly indicating the defendant is obligated up to this maximum amount.

======= Query Entaiments:
 **Task 1:**
Based on the provided article, the query "When the principal of the principal obligation has been crystallized, the guarantor is not liable to pay any interest accrued after the crystallization of such principal" is **False**. The article states that the guarantor is liable for "any interest, penalty and compensation for loss or damage in connection with the principal obligation" up to a certain maximum amount (Article 465-2(1)). This implies that the guarantor's liability includes interest accrued on the principal obligation, regardless of when it was crystallized.

**Task 2:**
Assessing whether the query expresses each factor:

1. The query does not directly mention "a contract for revolving guarantee", but it implies a scenario where the principal obligation has been crystallized, which is related to the concept of a revolving guarantee. However, this connection is indirect, and the query primarily focuses on the guarantor's liability after crystallization. Therefore, **(query entails 1)** is not strongly justified.
2. The query does not mention the guarantor being an individual or not a corporation, so **(query entails 2)** is not applicable.
3. The query mentions the principal obligation and interest accrued, which aligns with factor 3. However, it introduces a condition (crystallization of the principal) that is not explicitly addressed in factor 3. Thus, while there's some relevance, **(query entails 3)** is partially justified but does not fully align.
4. The query does not mention penalties or compensation for loss or damage agreed upon with regard to the guarantee obligation, so **(query entails 4)** is not applicable.
5. The query implies a limitation on the guarantor's liability by suggesting no further interest accrues after crystallization, but it does not explicitly discuss a maximum amount as in factor 5. Hence, **(query entails 5)** is partially justified but lacks direct relevance.
6. & 7. These factors deal with the contract's effectiveness and the application of Article 446, which are not directly addressed by the query. Therefore, **(query entails 6)** and **(query entails 7)** are not applicable.

Justifications generally do not strongly align with the result from Task 1, indicating that while the query touches on aspects related to the guarantor's liability, its specifics (especially regarding crystallization and interest accrual) are not directly addressed by the factors as outlined in the article.

**Task 3:**
The query suggests a specific condition under which the guarantor's liability is limited ("When the principal of the principal obligation has been crystallized"), implying that the guarantor would not be obligated to pay interest accrued after this point. However, based on the logical reasoning from Task 1, this interpretation does not align with the article's stipulations regarding the guarantor's liabilities. Therefore, in terms of determining whether the query places the defendant (guarantor) under an obligation, it actually attempts to limit or define the scope of this obligation under a specific condition, which according to our analysis is not supported by the article. Hence, the query does indeed pertain to the guarantor's obligations but misinterprets them. Given the context and focusing strictly on whether the query determines the defendant obligated in any manner, **pledged(1)** would be the appropriate representation because it discusses a scenario of obligation, even though the specifics of the obligation (post-crystallization interest) are incorrectly interpreted according to the article's stipulations.

 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

1. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person, that has given guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation.
2. A person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor.
3. The guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched.
4. The principal obligor may assert grounds for set-off against the obligee prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement.
5. If the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off, the guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off.
6. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement.
7. The guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation.

Verdict: A person that has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched, and if the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off, the guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I've generated seven unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of the factors occurred and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
Justification: The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person gives guarantee without the request of the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation. Since factor 1 is present, the defendant is legally obligated to follow the provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1).

2. (2 | N)
Justification: Becoming a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor (factor 2) alone does not necessarily imply legal obligation. Without additional factors, such as performance of an act for extinguishment or assertion of grounds for set-off, the defendant's obligations are unclear.

3. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The combination of factor 1 (provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply) and factor 3 (the guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched) indicates that the defendant is legally obligated to provide reimbursement, but only up to the extent they are currently enriched.

4. (2, 4 | N)
Justification: Although the principal obligor may assert grounds for set-off against the obligee prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement (factor 4), becoming a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor (factor 2) does not automatically create a legal obligation. The defendant's obligations depend on additional factors.

5. (1, 2, 5 | Y)
Justification: When the provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply (factor 1), the person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor (factor 2), and the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off (allowing the guarantor to demand performance of the obligation that would have been extinguished by that set-off, factor 5), the defendant is legally obligated to follow these provisions and potentially demand performance from the obligee.

6. (3, 6 | Y)
Justification: The combination of factor 3 (the guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched) and factor 6 (provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement) indicates that the defendant is legally obligated to provide reimbursement up to their current enrichment level, following the guidelines set forth in Article 459-2, paragraph (3).

7. (1, 2, 6, 7 | Y)
Justification: When the provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply (factor 1), the person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor (factor 2), the provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement (factor 6), and the guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation (factor 7), the defendant is legally obligated to adhere to these provisions, ensuring proper handling of the guarantee and reimbursement process.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 **Task 1:**
Based on logical reasoning, I conclude that the query is **True**. The article states that a person who has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched. This aligns with the query's statement that C shall have the right to obtain reimbursement only to the extent that A is actually enriched.

**Task 2:**
Here are my assessments for each factor:

1. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (1) apply mutatis mutandis if a person, that has given guarantee without the request of the principal obligor, performs an act for extinguishment of obligation.
(query entails 1) - The query considers a scenario where C, who has become a guarantor against the will of A, has performed the obligation.

2. A person has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor.
(query entails 2) - The query explicitly states that C has become a guarantor against the will of A.

3. The guarantor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched.
(query entails 3) - The query states that C shall have the right to obtain reimbursement only to the extent that A is actually enriched, which aligns with this factor.

4. The principal obligor may assert grounds for set-off against the obligee prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement.
(query does not entail 4) - The query does not mention anything about the principal obligor asserting grounds for set-off.

5. If the principal obligor asserts grounds for set-off, the guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by that set-off.
(query does not entail 5) - As factor 4 is not mentioned, this factor is also not applicable.

6. The provisions of Article 459-2, paragraph (3) apply mutatis mutandis to the exercise of the right to reimbursement.
(query does not entail 6) - The query does not mention anything about the application of Article 459-2, paragraph (3).

7. The guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation before the due date of the principal obligation.
(query does not entail 7) - While the query mentions that C has performed the obligation, it does not specify whether this was done before the due date.

My justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query is **True**.

**Task 3:**
Based on the article and the query, I conclude that the defendant (C) is obligated to obtain reimbursement only to the extent that A is actually enriched. Therefore, the output is:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 233, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here is the list of factors:

* A tree or bamboo branch from neighboring land crosses a boundary line
* The landowner has the right to request the owner of the tree or bamboo to take action
* The tree or bamboo belongs to the neighboring landowner
* The branch of the tree or bamboo crosses the boundary line into the landowner's property
* A tree or bamboo root from neighboring land crosses a boundary line
* The owner of the land has the right to take action regarding the root
* The root of the tree or bamboo crosses the boundary line into the owner's land

Verdict: The landowner may have the owner of that tree or bamboo sever that branch, and the owner of the land may sever that root.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 233, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | N)
Justification: Only factor 1 ("A tree or bamboo branch from neighboring land crosses a boundary line") is present. However, this alone does not determine the defendant's obligation, as it requires additional factors such as the landowner's right to request action.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Factors 2 ("The landowner has the right to request the owner of the tree or bamboo to take action") and 3 ("The tree or bamboo belongs to the neighboring landowner") are present. Although these factors establish a relationship between the parties, they do not directly address the issue of crossing the boundary line.

(4 | Y)
Justification: Factor 4 ("The branch of the tree or bamboo crosses the boundary line into the landowner's property") is present. This factor directly relates to the article's condition for taking action, and therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(5 | N)
Justification: Only factor 5 ("A tree or bamboo root from neighboring land crosses a boundary line") is present. Similar to factor 1, this alone does not determine the defendant's obligation without considering additional factors such as the owner's right to take action regarding the root.

(6, 7 | Y)
Justification: Factors 6 ("The owner of the land has the right to take action regarding the root") and 7 ("The root of the tree or bamboo crosses the boundary line into the owner's land") are present. These factors directly address the conditions for taking action regarding roots, making the defendant obligated.

(1, 2 | N)
Justification: Factors 1 ("A tree or bamboo branch from neighboring land crosses a boundary line") and 2 ("The landowner has the right to request the owner of the tree or bamboo to take action") are present. Although these factors establish a basis for requesting action, they do not confirm that the defendant is obligated without considering additional factors such as the ownership of the tree or bamboo.

(3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: Factors 3 ("The tree or bamboo belongs to the neighboring landowner"), 4 ("The branch of the tree or bamboo crosses the boundary line into the landowner's property"), and 5 ("A tree or bamboo root from neighboring land crosses a boundary line") are present. This combination establishes both the ownership and the crossing of the boundary line for branches and roots, making the defendant obligated to take action regarding both.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states: "If a tree or bamboo branch from neighboring land crosses a boundary line, the landowner may sever that branch by nis/her own." 

According to Article 233(1), it says, "the landowner may have the owner of that tree or bamboo sever that branch." This means the landowner has the right to request the owner of the tree or bamboo to sever the branch, not necessarily to do it themselves. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the specific wording of Article 233(1), the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

Given factors:
1. A tree or bamboo branch from neighboring land crosses a boundary line
2. The landowner has the right to request the owner of the tree or bamboo to take action
3. The tree or bamboo belongs to the neighboring landowner
4. The branch of the tree or bamboo crosses the boundary line into the landowner's property
5. A tree or bamboo root from neighboring land crosses a boundary line
6. The owner of the land has the right to take action regarding the root
7. The root of the tree or bamboo crosses the boundary line into the owner's land

Justifications:
- (query entails 1) because it mentions a branch crossing the boundary.
- It does not explicitly entail factor 2 since it suggests the landowner may sever the branch themselves, rather than requesting the neighbor to do so.
- (query entails 3) is implied as the branch belongs to the neighboring land.
- (query entails 4) as it describes the scenario where the branch crosses into the landowner's property.
- Factors 5, 6, and 7 are not directly related to the query since they pertain to roots rather than branches.

Justifications align with Task 1 in that the query misrepresents the action the landowner can take according to Article 233(1), supporting the conclusion that the query is False.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query does not explicitly state an obligation on the defendant (in this context, likely referring to the owner of the tree or bamboo) since it inaccurately suggests the landowner can sever the branch by themselves. Therefore, based on the information given and adhering strictly to the format requested:

pledged(0)

In summary:
- The query is **False** according to Article 233.
- Specific factors entailed by the query are: (query entails 1), (query entails 3), and (query entails 4).
- The defendant's obligation as per the query does not align with Article 233, thus: pledged(0)
