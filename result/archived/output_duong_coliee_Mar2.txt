======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break it down into steps to form the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query against this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) represents the outcome or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 613, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A lessor may demand rent directly from a sublessee based on the terms of the sublease.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For Article 613, these could include:
- **A1**: The legality and approval of the sublease agreement.
- **A2**: The terms of the original lease and sublease agreements.
- **A3**: The performance obligations of the lessee and sublessee.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors provides more specific conditions. For example:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The lessor's approval of the sublease.
- Under **A2**, base-level factors could include:
  - **B2**: The rent amount specified in the sublease agreement.
  - **B3**: The lessor's right to cancel the lease due to non-performance by the lessee.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Lessor's approval of the sublease supports the legality of the sublease agreement.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): The specified rent in the sublease agreement directly influences the terms under which the lessor can demand rent from the sublessee.
- (**B3** denies **R1**): If the lessor has a right to cancel due to non-performance, it could deny the lessor's ability to demand rent based on the original lease terms.

### Applying the ANGELIC Structure to the Query
Given the query: "A leased building D to B at 100,000 yen per month and delivered building D to B. Afterward, B subleased building D to C at 120,000 yen per month and delivered building D to C. If A has approved the sublease between B and C, A may demand that C pay 120,000 yen per month as a rent."

- (**query entails B1**): The query mentions that A (the lessor) has approved the sublease, which aligns with base-level factor **B1**, regarding the lessor's approval of the sublease.
- (**query agrees R1**): The scenario presented in the query supports the root node **R1**, as it describes a situation where the lessor (A) can demand rent directly from the sublessee (C), based on the terms of the approved sublease.

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of Article 613 and the constructed ANGELIC structure:
- The query indeed involves a scenario where the lessor has approved the sublease (**B1**).
- This approval supports the legality of demanding rent from the sublessee based on the sublease agreement (**A1**), which in turn supports the root node **R1** that a lessor may demand rent directly from a sublessee.

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agrees R1)

true label: N  - predicted label: N
1 correct 0 wrongs 1 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 641 is that the party ordering work may cancel the contract at any time whilst the contractor has not completed the work by paying compensation for loss or damage.
- **Root Node (R1):** The party ordering work can cancel the contract before completion.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors here include the right to cancellation, the timing of cancellation (before completion), and the condition of paying compensation for loss or damage.
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Right to cancellation before completion.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Payment of compensation for loss or damage as a condition.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B):
For A1, specific scenarios could include cancellation due to non-performance or due to change in requirements. For A2, base-level factors might involve the method of calculating damages and the timing of payment.
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Cancellation is allowed if the contractor has not started work.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Compensation must be calculated based on actual losses incurred by the contractor.

### 4. Establish Directed Links:
Each abstract factor supports the root node, as they are conditions or principles that validate the conclusion.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The right to cancellation before completion directly supports the ability of the party ordering work to cancel the contract.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Paying compensation for loss or damage is a condition that supports the feasibility of cancellation.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Cancellation being allowed if the contractor has not started work supports the broader principle of right to cancellation before completion.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Calculating compensation based on actual losses directly supports the principle of paying for loss or damage.

### Justification:
Given the query "The party ordering work may cancel the contract at any time whilst the contractor has not completed the work by compensating any damages," let's analyze if it entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root node.
- The query mentions cancellation before completion and compensation for damages, aligning with **A1** (right to cancellation) and **A2** (payment of compensation).
- For base-level factors, **(query entails B1)** because both discuss cancellation before work completion. However, the query does not specifically mention how damages are calculated or when payment must be made, so it doesn't directly entail **B2**.
- Comparing the query to the root node **R1**, we see that both state the party ordering work can cancel the contract before completion by compensating for damages. Thus, **(query agrees R1)**.

### Re-Justification:
Upon re-examination, considering the ANGELIC structure and the specifics of the query:
- The alignment with base-level factors like **B1** remains because both the query and **B1** pertain to cancellation before work completion.
- The agreement with the root node **R1** also holds because both assert the right to cancel before completion upon compensating for damages.

Therefore, the final analysis confirms:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agrees R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, we will follow the structured approach to analyze the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure. Then, we'll apply this structure to the query about B's situation and A's hedge repair.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should establish a clear legal conclusion or verdict based on the articles provided. From Article 650 and Article 702, we can derive two primary conclusions regarding the rights of a mandatary/manager in relation to expenses and obligations incurred for the benefit of the mandator/principal.

- **R1:** A mandatary/manager may claim reimbursement for necessary costs and compensation for losses not due to their negligence from the mandator/principal.
- **R2:** If a manager incurs beneficial expenses or obligations on behalf of a principal without obligation, they may claim reimbursement under certain conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the root conclusion. Based on the articles:

- **A1:** The mandatary/manager has incurred costs or expenses found necessary for the administration of the mandated business.
- **A2:** The obligation or expense was borne without negligence on the part of the mandatary/manager.
- **A3:** The act was performed with the consent or subsequent ratification of the mandator/principal.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific conditions:

- Under **A1**, we could have:
  - **B1:** The costs were directly related to maintaining or improving the principal's property (e.g., repairing a hedge).
  - **B2:** The expenses were incurred in an emergency situation where obtaining prior consent was impractical.

- Under **A2**:
  - **B3:** The mandatary/manager took reasonable care in incurring the obligation or expense.
  
- Under **A3**:
  - **B4:** The act, although initially without consent, was later ratified by the principal.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1 supports A1**): Directly related costs support the necessity of expenses for the mandated business.
- (**B2 supports A1**): Emergency situations justify incurring expenses without prior consent.
- (**B3 supports A2**): Reasonable care negates negligence on the part of the mandatary/manager.
- (**B4 supports A3**): Later ratification implies consent or approval for the act.

### Applying to Query
Given B's situation, where B requests a gardener to repair A's hedge without any obligation:

- **Query entails B1**: The query involves repairing a part of A's house (hedge), which is directly related to maintaining the principal's property.
- Considering the context, B acted without consent but in a manner that could be seen as beneficial or necessary for A's property. However, Article 702 and its application suggest that if B engaged in this act against A's will, reimbursement might only apply to the extent A is currently enriched.

### Justification
- The query **disagrees with R1** because, according to the provided legal framework, especially considering Article 702(3), if B acted against A's will (without consent or subsequent ratification), B may not demand full payment for the repair from A. Reimbursement could be limited or conditional based on A's current enrichment due to B's actions.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, recognizing that B performed an act without obligation and potentially against A's will, but still in a manner that could benefit A (repairing the hedge), it highlights the complexity of applying these principles to scenarios where consent or ratification is not clear-cut. The initial disagreement with R1 might need nuance based on specific legal interpretations regarding benevolent intervention and subsequent enrichment.

However, sticking strictly to the output format requested:

(query entails B1)
(query disagree R1)

3 correct 0 wrongs 3 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 487 is that if there is an instrument evidencing a claim and the person making the performance has made full performance, that person may demand the return of the instrument. Thus, the root node can be stated as:

- **R1**: A person who has completed full performance of a claimed amount may demand the return of the instrument evidencing the claim.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: Existence of an instrument evidencing a claim.
- **A2**: Completion of full performance by the person making the payment.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

For **A1**, we can refine it as follows:
- **B1**: The instrument is valid and properly executed, representing a genuine claim.
- **B2**: The claim represented by the instrument has not been previously satisfied or invalidated.

For **A2**:
- **B3**: The payment made covers the entire amount claimed in the instrument.
- **B4**: The payment was made in accordance with the terms of the instrument and applicable law.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Directed links can be established as follows:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Validity of the instrument supports the existence of a legitimate claim.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: The claim not being previously satisfied supports the relevance of the instrument.
- **(B3 supports A2)**: Payment covering the entire amount claimed supports the completion of full performance.
- **(B4 supports A2)**: Compliance with terms and law in making the payment supports the legitimacy of the performance.

### Query Analysis

Given the query "In cases where there is any instrument which evidences the claim for wages, the borrower may assert the fact that he/she will make a payment by returning and exchanging the instrument when attempting to make the performance has completed his/her entire performance.":

- **(query entails B1)**: The query considers a scenario with an instrument evidencing a claim (for wages), which aligns with the conditions under which an instrument is considered valid for representing a genuine claim.
- **(query entails B3)**: The query mentions completing "his/her entire performance," which implies covering the entire amount claimed, thus supporting the base-level factor of full payment.

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node

The query and **R1** are considering similar scenarios where there is an instrument evidencing a claim and the person has made (or intends to make) full performance. The query suggests that in such cases, returning or exchanging the instrument can be part of asserting the completion of payment, which aligns with demanding the return of the instrument after full performance as stated in **R1**.

- **(query agree R1)**: Both the query and **R1** essentially support the idea that upon completing the performance (in this case, making a payment), the person has the right to demand the return of the instrument evidencing the claim, reflecting agreement on the verdict in comparable situations.

Upon rejustification, considering the focus on the existence of an instrument for a wage claim and the completion of full performance, it's clear that the query aligns with the principles outlined in **R1** and supports the base-level factors related to the validity of the instrument and the completion of payment. Thus, the initial analysis stands as correct.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to address the query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by the outcome or legal conclusion that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 599, the root node can be formulated as:
- **R1**: A borrower must remove anything attached to the borrowed thing when the loan for use is terminated.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The ability to detach the attached item without excessive expenses.
- **A2**: The cause of any damage to the borrowed thing, specifically whether it is attributable to the borrower.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- **B1** (under A1): The attached item can be detached without causing significant harm or requiring excessive expenses.
- **B2** (under A2): The damage to the borrowed thing is not caused by grounds attributable to the borrower.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: If an item can be detached without significant harm or excessive expenses, it supports the obligation to remove attachments.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: If damage is not caused by grounds attributable to the borrower, it supports the exemption from restoring the borrowed thing.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The feasibility of detachment supports the conclusion that a borrower must remove attachments.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: If damage is due to non-attributable grounds, it denies the borrower's obligation to restore.

Given the query:
"A entered into a contract of loan for use with B to allow B to make use of building X owned by A. B attached removable shelves on the wall of building X upon making use of it. When the contract of loan for use is terminated, B must remove the shelves unless excessive expenses are required for the detachment."

### Justification
- **(query entails B1)**: The query mentions "removable shelves," which implies that the shelves can be detached without significant harm or excessive expenses, thus entailing base-level factor B1.
- To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with the root node (R1), we analyze the scenario presented:
  - **(query agree R1)**: The query states that "B must remove the shelves unless excessive expenses are required for the detachment," which aligns with the conclusion established by R1, considering the condition of detachment feasibility.

After re-justification, the analysis confirms the initial assessment regarding the relationship between the query and the base-level factor B1, as well as the agreement with the root node R1. The conditions presented in the query align with the legal principles outlined in Article 599, particularly concerning the removal of attachments when a loan for use is terminated. 

**Output**: 
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 493 is to establish that if the obligor tenders the performance in accordance with the main purport of the obligation and the obligee refuses to accept it, or if any act is required on the part of the obligee for the performance, a notice from the obligor about the prepared tender suffices. Thus, the root node (R1) can be defined as:
- **R1**: The obligor is relieved of responsibility for non-performance upon tendering performance in accordance with the obligation's main purport.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine R1 include:
- **A1**: Compliance with the main purport of the obligation.
- **A2**: The obligee's refusal to accept the performance.
- **A3**: The requirement for an act on the part of the obligee.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors, we get:
- Under A1 (Compliance with the main purport):
  - **B1**: Delivery at the specified location (domicile of the buyer in this case).
  - **B2**: Compliance with the type specification (type of wine).
- Under A2 (Obligee's refusal to accept performance):
  - No further refinement needed for this scenario.
- Under A3 (Requirement for an act on the part of the obligee):
  - No further refinement directly applicable to our specific query.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links are established as follows:
- **B1 supports A1** because delivering at the specified location is a key aspect of complying with the main purport of the obligation.
- **B2 supports A1** since delivering wine that matches the type specified also complies with the main purport.
- **A1 supports R1** as compliance with the obligation's main purport is crucial for relieving the obligor of responsibility.
- **A2 supports R1** because if the obligee refuses to accept, and the performance was tendered properly, the obligor should not be held responsible.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "In cases where the subject of sale, wine, is specified only with reference to a type, and the delivery of wine is effected at the domicile of the buyer; in case the buyer refuses to accept the performance in advance when the seller demands the acceptance thereof by giving a notice that tender of the performance has been prepared even if the seller brings wine to the domicile of the buyer with the main purport of the obligation he/she shall not be liable for damages for failure to perform the obligation of delivery of wine."

- **(query entails B1)** because it involves delivering the product (wine) at the specified location (domicile of the buyer).
- **(query entails B2)** since it mentions that the wine is specified only with reference to a type, implying compliance with this aspect of the obligation.
- Considering these base-level factors and how they support A1, which in turn supports R1, we can conclude:
  - **(query agree R1)** because both the query scenario and R1 conclude that the obligor (seller) should not be liable for damages when they have properly tendered performance according to the main purport of the obligation.

Upon re-justification, considering all provided information and focusing on the critical aspects of compliance with the obligation's main purport (type specification and delivery location), refusal by the buyer, and proper notice given by the seller, it reinforces that:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

These conclusions are based on the specific details of the query matching the scenarios described in the base-level factors (B1 and B2), which support the abstract factor A1, ultimately leading to agreement with the root node R1.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the article is to establish that if one joint and several obligor performs the obligation or obtains a common discharge without giving notice to other joint and several obligors, another joint and several obligor may assert a defense against the first obligor to the extent of their share of the obligation. Therefore, the Root Node can be stated as:
- **R1:** A joint and several obligor who has not been notified of a discharge by another obligor may assert a defense against that other obligor.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors substantiating or undermining this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The existence of a valid defense that one joint and several obligor can assert against the obligee.
- **A2:** The knowledge by one joint and several obligor of other joint and several obligors without giving notice of obtaining a common discharge.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1**:
- **B1:** The defense is based on a set-off that can be duly asserted against the obligee.
Refining **A2**:
- **B2:** The failure to give notice of obtaining a discharge affects the validity of acts performed by other joint and several obligors in good faith.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1 supports A1**): The ability to assert a set-off as a defense supports the existence of a valid defense against the obligee.
- (**A1 supports R1**): The existence of a valid defense supports the conclusion that an uninformed joint and several obligor may assert a defense against the informed one.
- (**B2 supports A2**): The impact of not giving notice on the validity of acts performed by other obligors supports the relevance of knowledge and notice in these scenarios.
- (**A2 supports R1**): The factor of knowing about other obligors without notifying them supports the conclusion that an uninformed joint and several obligor has grounds to assert a defense.

Given the query: "When one joint and several obligor (C) performs his/her obligation without giving to the other joint and several obligor (A) a notice, if A may have a claim vis-a-vis the obligee (B) and may set it off, A may refuse the reimbursement from C."

- **(Query entails B1)**: The scenario in the query involves A having a claim that can be set off against the obligee, which aligns with **B1**.
- **(Query agree R1)**: The query's conclusion that A may refuse reimbursement from C because A has a valid defense (the set-off) aligns with **R1**, indicating that an uninformed joint and several obligor can assert a defense against the one who obtained the discharge without notice.

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of the legal provisions and the query's details:
- The query indeed involves a scenario where A has a valid claim (set-off) against B, which is directly related to **B1**.
- This situation supports A's position in refusing reimbursement from C, aligning with the principle outlined in **R1**, given that C performed the obligation without notifying A.

Therefore, the justification holds:
- **(Query entails B1)**
- **(Query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to address the query regarding the invocation of extinctive prescription by a third-party acquirer of mortgaged land, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute.
- **R1**: The court may not make a judicial decision relying on prescription unless a party invokes it, including scenarios related to extinctive prescription for secured claims under mortgages.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion.
- **A1**: Invocation of Prescription - The act of a party invoking prescription as a defense or claim.
- **A2**: Legitimate Interest - A party must have a legitimate interest in the extinction of a right to invoke extinctive prescription.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors for specific conditions.
- **B1** (under A1): A third-party acquirer of mortgaged land invokes extinctive prescription after the mortgage creation and registration.
- **B2** (under A2): The acquirer has a legitimate interest in the extinction of the secured claim under the mortgage, such as clearing the title to the property.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links show how factors support or deny the occurrence of the root legal determination.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Invoking extinctive prescription by a third-party acquirer directly supports the condition that prescription must be invoked by a party.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Having a legitimate interest in the extinction of the secured claim supports the requirement for invoking extinctive prescription.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The invocation of prescription is necessary for the court to consider it, supporting the root node's condition.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Having a legitimate interest is crucial for the invocation of extinctive prescription, thereby supporting the root node.

Given the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure:
- **Query**: The one who acquired Land X after the mortgage had been created on Land X and the creation had been registered may invoke the extinctive prescription of the secured claim under the mortgage.
- This scenario directly aligns with **B1**, as it involves a third-party acquirer invoking extinctive prescription.

Justification:
- **(query entails B1)**: The query is about a specific situation where an acquirer invokes extinctive prescription, which matches the base-level factor B1.
- Considering the context and relationships defined in the ANGELIC structure, **B1** supports **A1**, and **A1** supports **R1**. This means that if the conditions for **B1** are met (and they are, as per the query), it aligns with the root node's requirement that prescription must be invoked by a party.
- Therefore, in terms of agreement or disagreement with the root node (**R1**) regarding the comparable situation:
  - **(query agree R1)**: The query and the root node agree on the principle that a party (in this case, a third-party acquirer) can invoke prescription under specific conditions.

Rejustification after careful consideration confirms these conclusions. The structure built based on Article 145 and applied to the query about invoking extinctive prescription by an acquirer of mortgaged land shows alignment with the legal provisions outlined in the article. 

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

 To address the given task, let's break down the process into the required steps to construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the query in relation to this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Given Article 425, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: A final and binding judgment upholding demand for rescission of a fraudulent act is effective against the obligor and all obligees.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion. For Article 425, we can identify:
- A1: The existence of a final and binding judgment.
- A2: The judgment upholds a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining the abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- B1 (supports A1): The judgment is made by a competent legal authority.
- B2 (supports A1): The judgment is based on sufficient evidence of fraud.
- B3 (supports A2): The fraudulent act has a direct impact on the contractual obligations.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Each factor must have a directed link to another factor, indicating whether it supports or denies the occurrence of the root legal determination or another abstract factor. For simplicity and based on the provided information:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A1
- B3 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

### Analysis of Query in Relation to ANGELIC Structure

Given query: "A final and binding judgment upholding demand for rescission of fraudulent act of C is effective against all obligees of A."

- **Entailment of Base-Level Factors**: The query implies a scenario where there's a competent legal authority (similar to B1) making a judgment based on evidence of fraud (akin to B2), and this fraud impacts contractual obligations (like B3). Thus, it can be said that (query entails B1), (query entails B2), and (query entails B3).

- **Agreement with Root Node**: The query's scenario aligns closely with the root node R1 in terms of the effectiveness of a final and binding judgment against all obligees due to a fraudulent act. However, it specifies "of C" and "of A", which introduces specific parties but does not alter the core legal principle that such a judgment is effective against all obligees involved. Therefore, (query agree R1).

Upon re-justification, considering the specificity of the query towards parties ("C" and "A") but understanding that the core principle remains unchanged regarding the effectiveness of the judgment against obligees due to fraud, the agreement with the root node holds true under the assumption that "C" and "A" are within the scope of obligors and obligees impacted by the fraudulent act.

Thus, the final analysis concludes:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we'll follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a bailee may not use the bailed thing without obtaining the consent of the bailor. Thus, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: A bailee must obtain consent from the bailor before using the bailed thing.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The nature of the bailment (e.g., gratuitous or for consideration).
- **A2**: The terms of use agreed upon by the parties.
These abstract factors can either support or deny the necessity of obtaining consent before using the bailed thing.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2**:
- **B1**: The bailment is gratuitous, implying that the bailee may have more restrictions on use without explicit consent.
- **B2**: The method of use is specified by the bailor, which could imply a condition under which the bailee can use the bailed thing without needing additional consent.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Being a gratuitous bailee may limit the bailee's ability to use the bailed thing without consent, supporting the idea that the nature of the bailment affects the requirement for consent.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Having a specified method of use can imply that certain uses are pre-approved, thus supporting the notion that terms of use affect the need for consent.
- **(A1 denies R1)**: If the bailment is gratuitous with an implied method of use, it might deny the necessity of obtaining explicit consent before every use, depending on the specific circumstances agreed upon by the parties.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: Having a clear agreement on the terms of use could deny the need for additional consent for each instance of use.

### Justification
Given the query "A gratuitous bailee may use the bailed thing in compliance with the method of use without obtaining the consent of the bailor," we can analyze its relationship to our constructed ANGELIC structure:
- **(query entails B2)**: The query specifically mentions using the bailed thing "in compliance with the method of use," which aligns with the scenario described by base-level factor **B2**.
  
Considering the most comparable root node, **R1**, and comparing it to the query's implication:
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query suggests that under certain conditions (gratuitous bailment with a specified method of use), the bailee may not need to obtain consent before using the bailed thing. This directly disagrees with **R1**, which states that consent must always be obtained.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, considering the nuances of the query and the structure:
- The presence of a specified method of use (**B2**) indeed supports the idea that there are scenarios where consent might not be necessary for each instance of use, particularly in gratuitous bailments.
- This scenario directly challenges the absolute requirement for consent stated in **R1**, especially under conditions where the method of use is predefined and compliance with it is expected.

Thus, the conclusion remains:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

This analysis aligns with the logical structure provided by the ANGELIC framework, ensuring a systematic approach to evaluating legal queries against established principles.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The article seeks to establish that if the subject matter of a claim is the delivery of a specific thing, the obligor must retain the thing with the due care of a prudent manager until the delivery.
   - Therefore, the root node can be stated as: "The obligor has a duty to preserve the specific thing with due care until delivery."
   - **R1:** The obligor must preserve the specific thing with due care until delivery.

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
     - The nature of the subject matter of the claim (being a specific thing).
     - The standard of care expected from the obligor (due care of a prudent manager).
     - Any special contracts or agreements between the parties.
   - **A1:** The subject matter is a specific thing.
   - **A2:** The standard of care for preservation is that of a prudent manager.
   - **A3:** Special contracts may alter preservation obligations.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For **A1**, a base-level factor could be the existence of a specific contract or agreement regarding the delivery of the thing.
     - **B1:** There is a specific contract for the delivery of the thing.
   - For **A3**, refining it could involve considering how special contracts specifically reduce obligations.
     - **B2:** A special contract reduces the obligor's preservation obligation.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **B1 supports A1** because having a specific contract for delivery directly relates to the subject matter being a specific thing.
   - **B2 supports A3** since it specifies how a special contract can alter obligations, in this case, by reducing them.
   - **A1 supports R1** as the nature of the claim (involving a specific thing) necessitates the duty to preserve with due care.
   - **A2 supports R1** because the standard of care expected is integral to fulfilling the preservation duty.
   - **A3 denies R1** in cases where special contracts reduce obligations, potentially altering the scope of the preservation duty.

Given the query: "The obligation for the preservation which the obligor contracts with the obligee until the delivery of the specific thing can be reduced with a special contract."

- This query directly relates to **B2**, as both consider scenarios where special contracts affect preservation obligations.
- Therefore, **(query entails B2)**.

Considering the relationship between the query and the root node (R1), which states that "The obligor must preserve the specific thing with due care until delivery":
- The query introduces a condition (special contract) under which the obligation can be reduced, implying an exception or modification to the general rule stated by R1.
- Thus, in scenarios where such special contracts exist, the query **(disagree R1)** because it suggests that the obligor's duty can be adjusted based on the terms of a special contract.

After careful reconsideration, the analysis remains consistent with the initial conclusions drawn from the ANGELIC structure and the query's implications on the legal obligations regarding the preservation of specific things until delivery.

7 correct 4 wrongs 11 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this framework, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the primary legal conclusion or verdict derived from the articles. Based on Article 176 and Article 177, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The creation and transfer of a real right become effective solely by the manifestations of intention of the parties, but acquisitions, losses, or changes in real rights on immovables are not duly asserted against third parties unless registered.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From the articles:
- **A1**: Manifestation of intention by parties for the creation and transfer of real rights.
- **A2**: Registration requirement for asserting changes in real rights against third parties.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors:
- Under **A1**, we can have:
  - **B1**: The existence of an agreement between the mortgagee and mortgagor.
  - **B2**: The form of the agreement (written or not).
- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: Registration of the creation of a real right according to applicable laws.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Establishing directed links:
- **B1 supports A1**: The existence of an agreement between parties supports the manifestation of intention.
- **B2 supports A1**: Even if not in writing, it can still support the manifestation of intention as per Article 176.
- **B3 supports A2**: Registration is necessary for asserting rights against third parties.

Given these steps and the ANGELIC structure formed, let's evaluate the query:
"If a mortgage creation contract has the agreement of the mortgagee and of the mortgagor that has ownership of the subject matter of the mortgage, it will be effective even if it is not in writing and there is no registration of its creation."

### Evaluation
- The query entails **B1** because it mentions an agreement between the mortgagee and mortgagor.
- The query also aligns with **B2** since it specifies that the contract's effectiveness isn't contingent on being in writing, which directly relates to the manifestation of intention as per Article 176.
- However, regarding registration (**B3**), the query suggests effectiveness without registration, which seems to contradict Article 177 when considering third parties.

### Justification
Given the ANGELIC structure and focusing on **R1**, the query's scenario (agreement between parties, not in writing, no registration) directly pertains to the creation of a real right being effective by manifestation of intention (**A1**), but it overlooks the necessity of registration for asserting these rights against third parties (**A2**).

### Conclusion
- **(query entails B1)**: The query involves an agreement between the mortgagee and mortgagor, aligning with **B1**.
- **(query disagree R1)**: While the query agrees that manifestation of intention makes a real right effective (as per Article 176), it disagrees with the necessity of registration for effectiveness against third parties as stated in Article 177, thus not fully aligning with **R1** when considering all aspects, especially regarding third-party assertions.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of both articles and the specific scenario presented by the query, it's clear that while there is alignment on the manifestation of intention (**A1**), the critical aspect of registration for effectiveness against third parties introduces a point of disagreement with **R1**, emphasizing the complexity of applying these legal principles to specific scenarios.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) should represent the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 335, the primary conclusion is about the order of payment for holders of general statutory liens, particularly how they are paid out of immovable and movable properties.

- **Root Node (R1):** Holders of general statutory liens must first be paid out of movables before being paid out of immovables, unless the claim remains unsatisfied after exhausting movable assets.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion. From Article 335:

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The existence of a hierarchy in the payment of general statutory liens, prioritizing movables over immovables.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The condition that allows for payment out of immovables only if the claim remains unsatisfied after exhausting movable assets.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For A1 and A2, we can refine them further:

- **Base-Level Factor (B1) for A1:** The legal principle that holders of general statutory liens cannot be paid out of immovables unless they are first paid out of property other than immovables.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) for A1:** The provision stating that with respect to immovables, holders must first be paid out of those not subject to special security.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3) for A2:** The condition allowing payment from immovables if a claim remains unsatisfied after distribution from other assets.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor and base-level factor should have a directed link indicating whether it supports or denies the root conclusion or another factor. For simplicity, we focus on direct relationships to the root node:

- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**

### Evaluating the Query
Given the query: "In cases where an obligor owns an immovable property and a movable property which are not the subject of an agreed security interest, a right of retention and a special statutory lien, the holders of general statutory liens are first paid out of the immovable property, and they are paid out of the movable property only if the claim that is not satisfied remains."

- **(query entails B1):** The query does not align perfectly with B1 because it suggests payment from immovables first, contrary to B1's principle.
- **(query disagree R1):** The query directly disagrees with the root node (R1) since R1 stipulates that holders of general statutory liens must first be paid out of movables before being paid out of immovables, unless the claim remains unsatisfied.

Upon reevaluation:
- The initial assessment might seem to misinterpret the direct application of the query to the base-level factors and root node. However, considering the specifics of the legal provisions and the query's statement about payment order, it's clear there's a disagreement with the established hierarchy in R1.
- The critical point is recognizing how the query reverses the priority stated in Article 335, suggesting immovable properties are considered first for payment, which contradicts the primary legal conclusion represented by R1.

Therefore, after careful consideration and reevaluation:
- **(query disagree R1)** remains the accurate assessment because the query's scenario directly challenges the order of payment stipulated in Article 335 as represented by the root node (R1).

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process into the required steps:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 506 is to establish that set-offs are effected through the manifestation of one party's intention to the other without adding any condition or time limit to this manifestation. Thus, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: A condition may not be added to the manifestation of set-offs.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion are:
- **A1**: The requirement for an unconditional manifestation of intention for set-offs.
- **A2**: The timing and effectiveness of the manifestation of intention in set-offs.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** into more specific conditions gives:
- **B1**: The manifestation of intention must be without any condition.
- **B2**: No time limit may be added to the manifestation of intention.

For **A2**, we have:
- **B3**: The manifestation is effective retroactive to when both parties' obligations became eligible for set-off.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Given the structure, we can establish that:
- **B1 supports A1**: Since a condition-free manifestation directly supports the unconditional requirement.
- **B2 supports A1**: As not adding a time limit also aligns with the unconditional requirement.
- **B3 supports A2**: Since it clarifies the timing aspect of the effectiveness of the set-off manifestation.
- **A1 supports R1**: Because an unconditional manifestation (including no conditions) directly supports the root that no condition may be added.
- **A2 supports R1**: The timing and effectiveness clarification indirectly support the notion by ensuring clarity in the process, which is essential for enforcing the rule about conditions.

### Query Analysis
Given the query "A condition may be added to manifestation of set-offs," we analyze its relationship with the established structure:
- **(query entails B1)**: Since the query directly contradicts the principle that no condition may be added (which B1 represents), it's clear they are considering similar evidence or scenarios but from opposite perspectives.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query directly opposes the root node's verdict, which states a condition may not be added to the manifestation of set-offs.

Upon careful reconsideration:
The initial analysis correctly identifies that the query contradicts both B1 and, by extension, R1. This contradiction is fundamental because the query suggests the opposite of what Article 506 states about adding conditions to manifestations of set-offs. Thus, the conclusion that the query entails a base-level factor similar to B1 (but from an opposing viewpoint) and disagrees with R1 holds true upon reevaluation.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 632 and Article 633, when combined with the query, seeks to establish that a contract for work is effective and remuneration must be paid upon delivery of the subject matter of the work performed. Thus, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1:** A contract for work is considered complete and remuneration is due when the work is delivered.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **A1:** Existence of a contract for work.
- **A2:** Completion and delivery of the subject matter of the work.
- **A3:** Payment of remuneration.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- **B1:** The parties have agreed on the terms of the contract for work, supporting **A1**.
- **B2:** The subject matter of the work has been delivered to the party who promised to pay remuneration, supporting **A2**.
- **B3:** Remuneration is paid simultaneously with the delivery of the work or as otherwise agreed upon, supporting **A3**.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**
- **(B3 supports A3)**
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**

Given the query, "In a lawsuit demanding the payment of remuneration based on a contract for work, proof must be demonstrated with objects of the claim that the contract for work has been concluded and, if the delivery of the subject matter of work is required, that this has been delivered," we can analyze its relationship with the constructed ANGELIC structure:

- The query essentially requires evidence of **B1** (contract conclusion) and **B2** (delivery of the subject matter of the work), which are base-level factors supporting the abstract factors **A1** and **A2**, respectively. Thus, **(query entails B1)** and **(query entails B2)**.
- Since both **B1** and **B2** support their respective abstract factors (**A1** and **A2**), which in turn support the root node **R1**, the query agrees with **R1**. The query demands proof of contract conclusion and delivery (if required), aligning with the conditions under which a contract for work is considered complete, and remuneration is due. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After careful reconsideration, the justification holds because the query specifically addresses scenarios where proof of contract conclusion and delivery (when applicable) must be demonstrated to demand payment, directly aligning with the conditions that support the root node's verdict on when a contract for work is considered complete and remuneration is due. 

Output:
- **(query entails B1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a person who has paid money or delivered anything as performance of an obligation cannot demand its return if they knew the obligation did not exist at the time. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A person may not demand the return of money paid or things delivered if they knew the obligation did not exist.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Knowledge of non-existence of obligation at the time of payment or delivery.
- **A2**: Performance of an obligation without an existing obligation.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2** into base-level factors:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The person had actual knowledge that the obligation did not exist.
- Under **A2**, another could be:
  - **B2**: The act of payment or delivery was made in ignorance of the non-existence of the obligation, but the person should have known (negligence).

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **B1** supports **A1** because having actual knowledge directly impacts one's ability to demand a return.
- **B2** denies **A1** since negligence in not knowing about the non-existence of an obligation might affect the legal outcome differently than actual knowledge.
- **A1** supports **R1** as it directly addresses the condition under which a person may not demand a return.
- **A2** could potentially deny or support **R1** depending on how it's interpreted in relation to negligence and knowledge, but given the context, **A2** (through its base-level factor **B2**) seems to introduce a nuance that could deny **R1** under specific circumstances of negligence rather than outright knowledge.

### Justification
Given the query: "A person who has tendered anything as performance of an obligation may not demand the return of the thing tendered if the person were negligent in not knowing that the obligation did not exist."

- The query entails **B2** because both consider scenarios where the person's state of knowledge (or lack thereof, due to negligence) at the time of performance affects their right to demand a return.
  
- Comparing the query with **R1**, we see they address similar situations but from slightly different angles. **R1** focuses on when the person knew the obligation did not exist, while the query introduces negligence as a factor. Given this nuance, the query seems to disagree with **R1** because it suggests an additional condition (negligence) under which demanding a return might be disallowed, potentially broadening the scenarios where a return can be denied beyond just actual knowledge.

Therefore:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

After careful reconsideration, this analysis holds as it correctly identifies the nuances introduced by the query regarding negligence and how these impact the comparison with **R1**.

 To address the task at hand, we must first analyze the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure as per the given instructions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 568 seeks to establish that in cases where an auction is conducted based on the Civil Execution Act, a successful bidder may cancel the contract or demand a reduction of the price under certain conditions. However, for our specific query regarding the retention of the object of compulsory auction by the right of retention, we focus on whether this situation allows for contract cancellation.

Root Node (R1): The successful bidder cannot cancel the contract if the object of compulsory auction is retained by the right of retention, even if unaware of this fact and unable to achieve the purchase's purpose due to the retention.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract Factor (A1): Knowledge of the Right of Retention - The bidder's awareness or lack thereof regarding the right of retention affecting the auctioned object.
Abstract Factor (A2): Purpose Achievement - The ability or inability to achieve the purpose of the purchase due to the right of retention.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1: Unawareness of Right of Retention - The successful bidder was not aware that the object of compulsory auction was retained by the right of retention.
Base-Level Factor (B2) under A2: Inability to Achieve Purchase Purpose - Due to the right of retention, the successful bidder cannot achieve the purpose for which they purchased the object.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
(B1 supports A1), (B2 supports A2)
(A1 denies R1), (A2 denies R1)

Given the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure:
- The query entails B1 because it considers a scenario where the successful bidder is unaware of the right of retention.
- The query entails B2 as it discusses the inability to achieve the purchase's purpose due to the right of retention.

Justifying whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root (R1) in the comparable situation:
- The query and R1 present a comparable scenario regarding the right of retention affecting the object of compulsory auction.
- However, upon closer examination, it appears there might have been an oversight in directly applying the provided articles to the specific query about the right of retention. The articles primarily discuss the successful bidder's rights in cases of non-conformity or absence of the object but do not explicitly address the scenario of a right of retention.

Re-justifying after careful consideration:
Given that the root node (R1) concludes the successful bidder cannot cancel the contract due to the right of retention, and considering the query presents a similar scenario where the successful bidder is unaware of the retention and cannot achieve the purchase's purpose, we must assess if this aligns with or contradicts R1.

The final justification:
- The query does indeed consider a base-level factor similar to B1 and B2.
- However, upon re-evaluation, it seems there was an initial alignment with the premise of R1 without fully considering the implications of the right of retention as presented in the query. The actual agreement or disagreement should be based on whether the successful bidder's situation (unaware of the right of retention and unable to achieve the purchase purpose) aligns with or contradicts the root's conclusion about contract cancellation due to such retention.

Given this, we realize that:
(query entails B1)
(query entails B2)

And upon careful consideration and re-justification regarding agreement with R1:
(query disagree R1), because the query seems to imply a situation where the successful bidder might seek cancellation due to unforeseen circumstances (right of retention), which contradicts the root's stance on contract cancellation in such scenarios.

Therefore, after thorough analysis and justification:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the query against this framework, we follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 634 seeks to establish that if a contractor receives any benefit from the performance of a divisible portion of the work due to grounds not attributable to the party ordering the work or if the contract for work is cancelled before completion, the contractor may demand remuneration in proportion to the benefit received. Thus, the Root Node (R1) can be defined as:
- R1: A contractor may demand proportional remuneration for completed portions of work under certain conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: Grounds not attributable to the party ordering the work.
- A2: Cancellation of the contract before completion of work.
- A3: Benefit received by the contractor from completed portions of work.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- B1 (supports A1): The contractor is no longer able to complete the work due to reasons not attributable to the party ordering the work.
- B2 (supports A2): The contract for work is cancelled before the completion of work, and this cancellation is due to reasons not specified as being attributable to either party.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Given the query: "If the contract for work terminates during performance due to reasons not attributable to the contractor, he/she may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed."

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root Node
The query entails B2 because it considers a scenario where the contract termination is due to reasons not attributable to the contractor, similar to what B2 outlines. Thus:
- (query entails B2)

Since B2 supports A2, and A2 in turn supports R1, the query agrees with the verdict presented by R1 in a comparable situation. Therefore:
- (query agree R1)

Upon rejustification, considering the legal framework provided and the specific conditions under which a contractor may demand remuneration for completed work portions, it's clear that both the entailment of B2 by the query and its agreement with R1 are consistent with the principles outlined in Article 634. 

Thus, the final assessment remains:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article discusses the liability of a sublessee to perform obligations directly to the lessor when a lessee lawfully subleases a leased thing. It also touches upon the rights of the lessor against the lessee and the sublessee in various scenarios, including cancellation by agreement.

Root Node (R1): A sublessee is liable to perform an obligation based on the sublease directly to the lessor, within the scope of the lessee's obligation.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
- A1: Lawful subleasing by the lessee.
- A2: Scope of the lessee's obligation based on the lease between the lessor and the lessee.
- A3: Rights of the lessor against the lessee.
- A4: Cancellation by agreement of the lease with the lessee.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
- B1 (under A1): The sublease is made with the knowledge or consent of the lessor.
- B2 (under A2): The obligation includes payment of rent within a specified period.
- B3 (under A3): The lessor's right to cancel due to non-performance by the lessee.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)
- (A3 denies R1 in cases of cancellation without non-performance by the lessee)

### Query Analysis
Given query: "In cases where the parties do not define the time for return in a contract for value of deposit for consumption of money, the depositor may not demand the return of money unless he/she issues a notice of demand to the depositary, specifying a reasonable period."

Justification:
- The query does not directly relate to the scenarios described by the base-level factors B1, B2, or B3, as it deals with contracts for the value of deposits and consumption of money rather than lease agreements.
- However, considering the principle of notice before demanding performance (similar to specifying a reasonable period in the query), we can argue that the concept of providing notice could be seen in a broader legal context as similar to ensuring that obligations are clear and agreed upon by all parties.

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node
The query does not directly agree or disagree with R1, as it pertains to a different type of contract (deposit for consumption of money) rather than lease agreements. However, if we were to stretch the comparison to the principle of clear obligations and notice, one might argue that both scenarios emphasize the importance of clear communication and agreement in contractual relationships.

Output:
- Since the query does not directly relate to the specific base-level factors derived from the article about leases, it's challenging to say it entails any base-level factor directly. However, considering the broader legal context, one might argue for a conceptual similarity.
- The query neither directly agrees nor disagrees with R1 due to the difference in contract types.

Rejustification:
Upon reevaluation, recognizing that the query and the article pertain to different contractual scenarios (lease agreements vs. deposit contracts), it's clear that direct comparisons are challenging without overgeneralizing legal principles. Therefore, any attempt to link the query directly to base-level factors or the root node would be a stretch beyond the specific context provided.

Thus, accurately:
- The query does not directly entail B1, B2, or B3.
- The query neither agrees nor disagrees with R1 in the direct sense applicable to lease agreements.

12 correct 7 wrongs 19 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R1) is: "A pledgee may collect monies that are the subject matter of a pledged claim to the extent of the portion that corresponds to the amount of the pledgee's own claim."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
- A1: The existence of a valid pledge agreement.
- A2: The pledge is over a monetary claim.
- A3: The pledgee has the right to collect the pledged claim.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
- B1 (under A1): The pledge agreement was properly notified to the debtor.
- B2 (under A2): The monetary claim is due and collectible.
- B3 (under A3): The pledgee's own claim is valid and enforceable.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1
- A3 supports R1

Given the query: "B created a pledge over Loan Claim Y of B against C in order to secure Loan Claim X of A against B, and B orally notified C to that effect. In this case, if both Claim X and Claim Y are due, A may directly collect Claim Y from C to the extent of the portion that corresponds to the amount of Claim X."

### Justification
- The query entails B1 because it mentions that B orally notified C about the pledge, which aligns with the scenario where proper notification (a base-level factor under a valid pledge agreement) is considered.
- The query also entails B2 and B3 because it specifies that both claims are due and implies that A has a valid claim against B, which corresponds to the conditions of having a due and collectible monetary claim and a valid enforceable claim by the pledgee.

### Agreement with Root Node
The query seems to align with R1 in the context provided: if A's claim (Claim X) is secured by a pledge over B's claim (Claim Y) against C, and both claims are due, then A can collect Claim Y from C up to the amount of Claim X. This directly reflects the principle stated in R1, where a pledgee may collect monies from a pledged claim up to the amount of their own claim.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the primary legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 93, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired by the person's knowledge that it does not reflect their true intention, under certain conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion. From Article 93:
- **A1**: Knowledge of the person making the manifestation about its truthfulness.
- **A2**: The other party's knowledge or potential knowledge regarding the true intention behind the manifestation.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- Under **A1**, we can refine it to:
  - **B1**: The person making the manifestation knows it does not reflect their true intention.
- Under **A2**, refinement leads to:
  - **B2**: The other party is unaware of the true intention.
  - **B3**: There was no gross negligence on the part of the other party regarding their lack of knowledge.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links must either support or deny the occurrence of the root legal determination or another abstract factor:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Knowing one's true intention does not necessarily invalidate the manifestation.
- **(B2 supports A2)** and **(B3 supports A2)**: Both factors contribute to the condition under which the manifestation remains valid despite concealment of true intention.
- **(A1 denies R1)**: If the person knows their manifestation doesn't reflect their true intention, it could potentially invalidate it under certain conditions.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The unawareness of the other party and lack of gross negligence support the validity of the manifestation.

### Justification
Given the query: "In the case of concealment of true intention, assuming the other party was unaware of the true intention of the party making the manifestation, and there was no gross negligence regarding that lack of knowledge, that manifestation of intention shall be valid."

- **(query entails B2)**: The query directly considers a scenario where the other party is unaware of the true intention.
- **(query entails B3)**: It also assumes there was no gross negligence on the part of the other party.

Regarding agreement with the root:
- **(query agree R1)**: Both the query and R1 conclude that under specific conditions (including those where the other party is unaware and not grossly negligent), a manifestation of intention remains valid despite concealment of true intention.

After rejustification, the conclusion stands as the query aligns with the base-level factors regarding the unawareness of the other party and lack of gross negligence, supporting the root node's conclusion on the validity of the manifestation under those conditions. 

Output:
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 200(2) seeks to establish that "B may not demand C to return X by an action for recovery of possession" if C has stolen X from B, who had defrauded A of Movable X owned and possessed by A.

- **Root Node (R1):** B may not demand the return of X from C through an action for recovery of possession when C steals X from B, who acquired it fraudulently from A.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The original possessor's right to recover possession.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The manner in which the current possessor acquired the item (fraudulently).
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The successor's knowledge of the unlawful acquisition.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors gives us:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The original possessor was dispossessed forcibly or through fraud.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The current possessor did not acquire the item in good faith.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(A1 supports R1):** The right to recover possession supports the conclusion that B cannot demand its return from C through this action.
- **(A2 denies R1):** If B had acquired X in a manner that did not involve fraud, it might alter the legal standing regarding recovery of possession.
- **(B1 supports A1):** Being dispossessed forcibly or through fraud directly impacts one's right to recover possession.
- **(B2 supports A2):** Not acquiring an item in good faith affects the legitimacy of possessing and recovering the item.

### ANGELIC Structure:
- **R1:** B may not demand C to return X by an action for recovery of possession.
  - Supported by: A1
  - Denied by: A2
- **A1:** Original possessor's right to recover possession.
  - Supported by: B1
- **A2:** Manner of acquisition (fraudulent).
  - Supported by: B2

### Query Analysis:
Given the query, "B has defrauded A of Movable X owned and possessed by A. If C has stolen X from B, B may not demand C to return X by an action for recovery of possession," we analyze its relation to the constructed ANGELIC structure.

- The query directly involves **Base-Level Factor (B1)** because it specifies a situation where the original possessor (A) was defrauded, implying forcible or fraudulent dispossession.
- It also aligns with **Base-Level Factor (B2)** since B acquired X through fraud, not in good faith.

Thus, **(query entails B1)** and **(query entails B2)** because both base-level factors are applicable to the scenario described in the query.

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node:
The query presents a scenario where B's acquisition of X was fraudulent, and C stole it from B. According to Article 200(2), if B (the person who forcibly or fraudulently took possession) tries to recover X from C (who stole it from B), B cannot use an action for recovery of possession against C unless C knew about the unlawful taking.

Therefore, **(query agree R1)** because both the query and the root node conclude that in such a scenario, B may not demand the return of X from C through an action for recovery of possession, given the specific conditions outlined (fraudulent acquisition by B).

After re-justification, considering the direct application of Article 200(2) to the query's scenario and the alignment with base-level factors regarding forcible or fraudulent dispossession and lack of good faith in acquisition, the conclusion stands.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to analyze the given query in relation to this structure, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node (R) represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 449, the root node can be identified as follows:
- R1: A guarantor who is aware of the principal obligor's limited capacity to act (e.g., being a minor) at the time of entering into a guarantee contract is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation if the original obligation is voidable.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root node's conclusion.
- A1: Awareness of the guarantor about the principal obligor's limited capacity to act at the time of guarantee contract formation.
- A2: The voidability of the original obligation due to the principal obligor's limited capacity.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining abstract factors into base-level factors helps in dealing with specific scenarios or conditions directly.
- B1 (under A1): The guarantor was aware that the principal obligor (A) is a minor without legal representative consent at the time of guarantee contract formation.
- B2 (under A2): The obligation between A and B can be rescinded due to A's minority status without proper representation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Each abstract factor and base-level factor must have a directed link indicating whether it supports or denies the occurrence of another factor or the root node.
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root Node

Given the query: "In cases where the contract of guarantee between C and B is concluded with respect to monetary debt of A against B; in the case A is a minor and assumed the obligation against B without consent of the legal representative, C was aware, at the time of entering into a contract guarantee, of such fact, C shall be presumed to have assumed an independent obligation of the same subject in the event of rescission of the obligation of A."

- The query entails base-level factor B1 because both consider scenarios where the guarantor (C) is aware of the principal obligor's (A) minority status and lack of legal representative consent at the time of guarantee contract formation.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.

Considering the root node R1, which states that a guarantor aware of the principal obligor's limited capacity to act is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation if the original obligation is voidable:
- The query and R1 agree because both conclude that the guarantor (C) assumes an independent obligation under similar conditions (awareness of A's minority status and potential rescission of A's obligation).
- Therefore, **(query agrees R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering all aspects and links within the ANGELIC structure:
- The conclusion holds that the query indeed entails B1 due to the shared scenario specifics.
- The agreement with R1 also stands because both the query and R1 lead to the same legal verdict under comparable circumstances.

Thus, the final justification affirms the initial conclusions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) is determined by the outcome or the legal conclusion that the article seeks to establish. In this case:
- **R1**: A party to a bilateral contract may refuse to perform their obligation until the other party tenders their performance, provided the other party's obligation is due.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For R1:
- **A1**: The principle of simultaneous performances in bilateral contracts.
- **A2**: The condition that the obligation of the other party must be due.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific scenarios:
- **B1** (under A1): In cases where both parties' obligations are interdependent, requiring simultaneous performance.
- **B2** (under A2): The obligation of the other party being due is a prerequisite for refusing performance.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The principle of simultaneous performances supports the conclusion that a party may refuse to perform until the other party tenders their performance.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The condition that the other party's obligation must be due also supports this conclusion.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Interdependent obligations support the principle of simultaneous performances.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The prerequisite of the other party's obligation being due supports the condition regarding due obligations.

### Query Analysis
Given the query about a minor rescinding a movable sale contract without consent and the relationship between the seller's reimbursement obligation and the buyer's return obligation:
- The query involves specific conditions (a minor, movable sale contract, lack of consent) but centers on the principle of simultaneous performances in contractual obligations.
- **(query entails B1)**: Because it considers a scenario where two obligations (reimbursement by the seller and return of the subject matter by the buyer) are interdependent, implying simultaneous performance.

### Agreement with Root Node
Considering R1 and the query's context:
- The query essentially agrees with the principle established in R1. It discusses a specific situation where simultaneous performances (or their equivalents, such as reimbursement for one party and return of goods for the other) are relevant.
- **(query agree R1)**: Both the query and R1 align on the importance of considering the interdependence of obligations in contractual performance.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation:
- The core of both the article and the query is about the conditions under which one party can refuse to fulfill their obligation in a bilateral contract.
- The focus on simultaneous performances or equivalent considerations (like reimbursement and return) underscores the mutual dependency of these actions in certain contractual contexts.

Thus, the analysis confirms that the query indeed entails a base-level factor related to simultaneous performances and agrees with the root node's verdict regarding the refusal of performance based on the due obligations of both parties.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 117 seeks to establish that a person who concludes a contract as an agent of another person is liable to the counterparty for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage unless they prove their authority to represent or the principal ratifies the contract.

- **Root Node (R1):** A person acting as an unauthorized agent is liable for the contract's performance or damages unless they can prove their authority or obtain the principal's ratification.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
- The agent's belief in their authority.
- The counterparty's knowledge or negligence regarding the agent's authority.
- The existence of restrictions on the agent's legal capacity to act.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The agent's genuine belief in having the authority to act.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The counterparty's awareness or negligence about the agent's lack of authority.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Restrictions on the agent's legal capacity to act.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under A1, a base-level factor could be the agent's non-negligent belief in their authority.
- Under A2, base-level factors could include the counterparty's knowledge of the lack of authority and their negligence in not knowing.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The agent believed they had authority without being negligent.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The counterparty knew the agent lacked authority.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The counterparty was negligent in not knowing about the lack of authority, but this does not apply if the agent knowingly acted without authority.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1):** If the agent genuinely believed they had authority, it could reduce their liability under certain conditions.
- **(A2 denies R1):** If the counterparty knew or was negligent about the agent's lack of authority, this could negate the agent's liability.
- **(A3 denies R1):** Restrictions on the agent's legal capacity to act could deny their liability.
- **(B1 supports A1):** The agent's non-negligent belief in their authority supports the abstract factor of the agent's genuine belief.
- **(B2 denies R1):** Directly affects the root by potentially removing the agent's liability if the counterparty knew about the lack of authority.
- **(B3 supports A2):** The counterparty's negligence supports the abstract factor regarding their awareness or lack thereof.

Given the query: "When an unauthorized agent acted believing that it had had authority of agency without negligence, it shall not be liable to the counterparty for the performance of the contract or damages even if it is unable to obtain the ratification of the principal."

- **(query entails B1):** The query directly relates to a scenario where the agent believed they had authority without being negligent.
- **(query agree R1):** Upon closer examination, the query actually aligns with an interpretation that under specific conditions (like those described in Article 117's exceptions), an unauthorized agent might not be liable. This suggests agreement rather than disagreement with the root node's general premise, considering the nuances of liability based on knowledge and negligence.

After rejustification, it's clear that the initial structure and analysis correctly identify the query's alignment with a base-level factor and its overall agreement with the root node under specific conditions outlined in the legal provisions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break it down into steps according to the ANGELIC structure formation criteria.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should represent a legal conclusion or verdict based on the articles provided. 
- **Root Node (R1):** A lessee may retain a leased property until their security deposit is returned after the lease termination, under specific conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that validate or invalidate the root conclusion.
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The existence of a claim by the possessor related to the thing possessed (Article 295).
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The termination of the lease and the return of the leased property (Article 622-2).

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions.
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The possessor has a claim that has arisen in relation to the thing possessed and this claim is due (Article 295).
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The lessor receives the return of the leased property upon lease termination, enabling them to refund the security deposit after deducting any owed rent or damages (Article 622-2).

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Defining how each factor supports or denies the occurrence of another.
- **Link:** B1 supports A1
- **Link:** B2 supports A2
- **Link:** A1 denies R1 (because retaining a property is not about returning a security deposit but about satisfying a claim related to the property)
- **Link:** A2 supports R1 (because lease termination and return of property are conditions under which the lessor must refund the security deposit, implying the lessee's right to have their deposit returned)

### Justification
Given the query: "A leased Building X from B owned by B and delivered a security deposit to B, and the lease was terminated. In this case, A may retain Building X until the security deposit is returned."
- The query entails **B2** because both involve the termination of a lease and the return of the leased property, which are conditions for refunding the security deposit.
- However, upon closer inspection, the root node R1 seems to misinterpret the application of Article 295 in the context of the query. Article 295 is about retaining property due to claims related to that property, not directly about security deposits. The actual applicable article for the scenario described (retaining a leased property until a security deposit is returned) would relate more closely to lease agreements and security deposit laws as outlined in Article 622-2.
- Given this clarification, the query actually **disagrees with R1** because retaining the leased property (Building X) until the security deposit is returned isn't directly supported by either article in the manner described. The correct interpretation involves the lessor's obligation to return the security deposit after lease termination and receipt of the leased property, not the lessee retaining the property.

### Rejustification
Upon reconsideration, recognizing that Article 295 pertains to retention due to claims related to the possessed thing and Article 622-2 deals with the refund of security deposits upon lease termination:
- The query **entails B2** because it involves lease termination and conditions around the return of the leased property.
- However, the initial root node R1 and its direct application might be misleading. A more accurate interpretation would focus on whether a lessee can retain a property under the described circumstances based on the provided articles. Given this, **the query disagrees with the premise as initially interpreted** because it misunderstands the legal basis for retaining a leased property in relation to security deposit refunds.

Output:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 313 is to establish that a statutory lien of a lessor exists under certain conditions. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** The statutory lien of a lessor exists against specific movables.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion about the existence of a statutory lien. From Article 313, we can derive:
- **A1:** The provision of movables for the use of the land or building.
- **A2:** The type of lease (land or building) and its implications on the lien.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, we can refine it further:
- **B1:** Movables furnished to the land for its use.
- **B2:** Movables furnished to a building by the lessee.
For **A2**:
- **B3:** The lease is specifically for land.
- **B4:** The lease is specifically for a building.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Movables furnished to the land support the provision of movables for its use.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: Movables furnished to a building by the lessee also support the provision of movables for its use.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The provision of movables for the use of the land or building supports the existence of a statutory lien.
- **(B3 supports A2)** and **(B4 supports A2)**: Specific types of leases (for land or building) support the consideration of the type of lease and its implications.

### Query Analysis
Given the query "The statutory lien of a lessor of a building shall exist with movables furnished to that building by the lessee," we can analyze it against our structure:
- The query specifically mentions movables furnished to a building by the lessee, which directly corresponds to **B2**.
- Therefore, **(query entails B2)**.

### Agreement with Root Node
Since **B2** supports **A1**, and **A1** in turn supports **R1**, the query indirectly supports **R1**. The query does not introduce any conditions that would deny or contradict **R1**; instead, it specifies a scenario where **R1** applies.
- Thus, **(query agree R1)**.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, considering the direct link between the query and **B2**, and the supportive relationship from **B2** to **A1** and then to **R1**, it's clear that the query aligns with the conditions under which a statutory lien exists according to Article 313. The specificity of the scenario (movables furnished to a building by the lessee) is directly addressed by the article, reinforcing the conclusion.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B2), (query agree R1)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 599 seeks to establish that a borrower must restore a borrowed thing to its original condition when the loan for use is terminated, considering certain conditions.

- **Root Node (R1):** A borrower must restore a borrowed thing to its original condition on termination of the loan for use.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- The obligation to remove attached things.
- The restoration of damaged things.
- Conditions under which removal or restoration may not be required.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Obligation to remove attachments.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Requirement to restore damages.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Exemptions from removal or restoration obligations.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under A1, we have conditions for detachment and exceptions due to excessive expenses or impossibility of detachment.
- Under A2, damages not attributable to the borrower may exempt restoration.
- A3 can be refined based on specific exemptions like inability to detach without damage or excessive expense.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The borrower must remove attachments unless they cannot be detached without damaging the borrowed thing or require excessive expenses.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Restoration is not required for damages caused by grounds not attributable to the borrower.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Exemptions apply if removal or restoration would cause undue expense or damage.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Because B1 outlines specific conditions under which a borrower is not obligated to remove attachments, directly supporting the abstract concept of obligations regarding attached items.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Since B2 specifies when restoration is not required, it supports the abstract factor concerning restoration requirements.
- **(B3 supports A3)**: As B3 details scenarios where exemptions apply, it supports the abstract factor about exemptions from removal or restoration.

Given these steps and considering Article 616 which applies similar principles to leases, let's evaluate the query:

"A borrower must restore a borrowed Thing to its original condition on termination of the loan for use, but the borrower must obtain the consent of the lender to remove anything attached to the borrowed Thing.
A lessee must restore a leased Thing to its original condition on termination of the lease, but the lessee need not obtain the consent of the lessor to remove anything attached to the leased Thing."

### Justification
- The query entails **B1** because it discusses the removal of attachments under certain conditions similar to what B1 outlines.
- However, the query specifically mentions obtaining consent for removal in the context of borrowing, which is not directly addressed by our derived base-level factors but seems to introduce a condition (need for consent) not explicitly covered by Article 599 or our factors. 
- For leases, as per Article 616 and the query, there's an implication that consent might not be needed for removals in leasing, aligning with the notion of different treatment between borrowing and leasing scenarios.
- The query **disagrees R1** because while it supports the restoration requirement, it introduces a condition (obtaining lender's consent for removal) not explicitly stated in Article 599 or our derived factors.

After rejustification:
- Given that B1 directly pertains to conditions of removal and the query discusses a specific scenario involving borrower-lender interaction not fully encapsulated by our initial base-level factors, there is an alignment in context but a difference in specifics.
- The core of R1 (restoration requirement) is supported, but the query adds nuances regarding consent for attachments that weren't directly addressed in our structure.

Thus, considering the evidence and the structure:
- **(query entails B1)** because it involves conditions around removal similar to what B1 outlines.
- **(query disagree R1)** due to the introduction of consent as a factor not explicitly covered by our initial analysis.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the provided task, let's construct the ANGELIC structure step by step based on the given legal provisions.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 568 seeks to establish that a successful bidder at an auction may cancel the contract or demand a reduction of the price against the obligor under certain conditions, and may also claim compensation for loss or damage if the obligors or obligees knew of the absence of the object or right and did not disclose it. 
- **R1:** A successful bidder can seek remedies (cancellation, price reduction, or compensation) due to non-disclosure of defects in an auctioned item.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The presence of defects or absence of the object/right in the auctioned item.
- **A2:** Knowledge and non-disclosure by obligors or obligees about the defects or absence.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1:
- **B1:** The auctioned item has a latent defect that was not disclosed.
- **B2:** The obligor knew of the defect and failed to disclose it before the auction.

Refining A2:
- This is already quite specific but can be seen as encompassing B2 directly in terms of non-disclosure.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The existence of a latent defect supports the abstract factor of defects/absence.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Knowledge and failure to disclose by the obligor support the abstract factor of non-disclosure.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The presence of defects or absence supports the bidder's right to seek remedies.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Non-disclosure by obligors or obligees supports the bidder's right to claim compensation.

Given the query: "In cases where a compulsory auction was conducted for a used building, the purchaser of the building can demand the original building owner to compensate damages due to the reason that the building has a latent defect."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query involves a scenario with a latent defect in the auctioned item.
- **(query agrees R1)**: The query aligns with the root node's conclusion that the bidder can seek remedies (in this case, compensation) due to the non-disclosure of defects.

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and relationships established:
- The query indeed involves a base-level factor of having a latent defect (**B1**), which directly supports **A1**, leading to the root conclusion **R1**.
- The scenario presented in the query does align with the conditions under which a bidder can seek compensation or other remedies as per **R1**, thus there is agreement.

Therefore, the final output based on the analysis is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article seeks to establish that acquisitions of, losses of, and changes in real rights on immovables are not duly asserted against any third parties unless they are registered according to the applicable provisions. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1:** "Registration is necessary for asserting changes in real rights against third parties."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The existence of a sales contract.
- **A2:** The registration of the ownership transfer.
- **A3:** The knowledge and negligence of subsequent buyers regarding previous sales contracts.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- **B1:** A sales contract was concluded between two parties.
- **B2:** The ownership transfer registration procedure was undertaken.
- **B3:** The subsequent buyer had no knowledge of the previous sales contract at the time of their purchase.
- **B4:** The subsequent buyer was not negligent about the previous sales contract.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(B1 supports A1):** Having a concluded sales contract supports the existence of an agreement for the sale of immovable property.
- **(B2 supports A2):** Undertaking the ownership transfer registration procedure directly supports the condition of registration.
- **(B3 supports A3):** Lack of knowledge about previous contracts supports the condition of good faith in subsequent transactions.
- **(B4 supports A3):** Absence of negligence regarding previous sales contracts further supports the good faith condition.
- **(A1 denies R1 if not accompanied by A2):** The existence of a sales contract without registration does not fulfill the requirement for asserting rights against third parties, thus indirectly denying R1 in such cases.
- **(A2 supports R1):** Registration directly supports the root node's assertion about the necessity of registration.
- **(A3 supports R1):** Good faith (lack of knowledge and no negligence) on the part of subsequent buyers supports the validity of their claim through proper registration.

### Analysis of Query:
Given the query, where A sells land to B without registering the transfer, then sells it to C with registration, and B seeks to have the ownership transferred from C to B:
- **(Query entails B1):** The query involves concluded sales contracts.
- **(Query entails B2):** It mentions an undertaken ownership transfer registration procedure (from A to C).
- **(Query entails B3):** It implies that C was without knowledge of the First Sales Contract at the time of the Second Sales Contract's conclusion.
- **(Query entails B4):** It suggests that C was not negligent about the First Sales Contract, as there is no mention of C having any reason to know about it.

### Justification:
Considering these base-level factors and their support for abstract factors which in turn support or deny the root node, we analyze if the query agrees or disagrees with R1. The query essentially tests the scenario where registration (or lack thereof) affects the assertion of rights against third parties. Since C's claim is based on a registered transfer, which aligns with the necessity of registration as per R1, and B's claim is weakened by the lack of registration:
- **(Query agrees R1):** The query ultimately supports the root node's assertion that registration is necessary for asserting changes in real rights against third parties. C's position, being based on a registered sale, would typically be considered stronger than B's unregistered claim.

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances of property law and the specifics of the scenario presented:
- The critical aspect remains the registration status and the good faith of subsequent buyers.
- The query indeed aligns with the principle that registered interests are generally prioritized over unregistered ones, supporting the necessity of registration as outlined in R1.

Therefore, the conclusion stands that the query supports the root node's assertion regarding the importance of registration for asserting real rights against third parties.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the primary legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Based on Article 248 and related provisions, the root node can be identified as:
- R1: A person who suffers loss due to the application of certain provisions may demand compensation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For this scenario, abstract factors could include:
- A1: The principle of unjust enrichment and its application.
- A2: The concept of accession and its implications on ownership.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors into more specific base-level factors:
- B1 (under A1): The beneficiary receiving a benefit without legal cause must return it, especially in cases involving mixed properties.
- B2 (under A2): When movable properties cannot be separated without damage or at excessive expense, the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal property.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links connect factors and indicate whether they support or deny the occurrence of a legal determination:
- B1 supports A1.
- B2 supports A2.
- A1 supports R1, as it provides a basis for demanding compensation based on unjust enrichment principles.
- A2 supports R1, by clarifying ownership in cases of accession, which can lead to situations where compensation is sought.

### Applying the ANGELIC Structure to the Query
Given the query: "In cases liquid P (100 cubic meters) owned by A was blended with liquid Q (10 cubic meters) owned by B into liquid R (110 cubic meters) so that they cannot be distinguished and A acquired the ownership of liquid R, B may demand compensation from A in accordance with the provisions of unjust enrichment."

### Justification
- The query entails B1 because it involves a situation where properties are mixed, and one party (B) loses their separate property, potentially leading to a claim under unjust enrichment principles.
- The query also agrees with R1 because both involve scenarios where compensation is sought due to the application of legal provisions regarding accession and unjust enrichment.

### Final Justification
After careful consideration, it's clear that the scenario described in the query aligns with the base-level factor B1, as it deals with mixed properties and potential claims for compensation. Moreover, the outcome sought by B (demanding compensation) is consistent with the root node R1, which establishes the principle of seeking compensation under certain legal provisions.

### Output
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

This justification demonstrates that the query aligns with the principles outlined in the provided articles, particularly concerning unjust enrichment and accession. The scenario presented fits within the framework established by these legal provisions, supporting the conclusion that B may seek compensation from A under the circumstances described.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. Based on Article 32, the legal conclusion is that a declaration of disappearance can be rescinded under certain conditions, and this affects property acquired due to such a declaration.

- **R1:** A person who has acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance must return that property upon rescission, but only to the extent they are currently enriched.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For Article 32:

- **A1:** Good faith actions after the declaration of disappearance but before its rescission.
- **A2:** The condition of enrichment at the time of rescission.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific conditions or scenarios:

- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1:** The person acted in good faith regarding the survival status of the missing person at the time of acquiring property.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2:** The extent of current enrichment directly resulting from the acquisition of property due to the declaration of disappearance.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor and its refinement into base-level factors must either support or deny the root node or another abstract factor:

- (**B1 supports A1**): Acting in good faith supports the principle that actions taken after a declaration but before rescission are valid.
- (**B2 supports A2**): The extent of current enrichment directly relates to the condition of returning property only to that extent.

### Analysis of Query
Given the query: "In the event that a declaration of disappearance is rescinded, a person who has acquired property due to the declaration of disappearance must return to the missing person the full amount of the benefits received from the acquisition of the property, even if the person acted in good faith regarding the survival of the missing person."

- The query entails **B1** because it considers the scenario where the person acted in good faith but focuses on the obligation to return the full amount of benefits.
  
- However, the query and **R1** disagree. **R1** states that the return is only to the extent of current enrichment, while the query suggests returning the full amount of benefits regardless of current enrichment.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

Justifying further, it's clear that the disagreement stems from how each treats the concept of "returning property" upon rescission. The law (as represented by **R1**) emphasizes returning only to the extent of current enrichment, protecting those who acted in good faith and ensuring fairness based on the current state of affairs. In contrast, the query suggests a more absolute approach to restitution, disregarding the nuances of good faith actions or changes in enrichment status over time. This fundamental difference highlights why the query disagrees with **R1**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the article is to establish that a person who concludes a contract as an agent of another person without authority is liable to the counterparty unless certain conditions apply.

- **R1**: A person acting as an unauthorized agent is liable for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **A1**: The agent's authority to represent the principal.
- **A2**: The counterparty's knowledge or negligence regarding the agent's authority.
- **A3**: Restrictions on the agent's legal capacity to act.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A2**:
- **B1**: The counterparty knew that the agent had no authority to represent.
- **B2**: The counterparty was negligent in not knowing that the agent had no authority to represent, and the agent knew they had no authority.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Authority to represent supports the conclusion of liability.
- (**A2** denies **R1**): Counterparty's knowledge or negligence regarding the agent's authority can deny the liability conclusion.
- (**A3** denies **R1**): Restrictions on the agent's legal capacity to act can also deny the liability conclusion.
- (**B1** supports **A2**): Knowing the agent had no authority is a scenario where the counterparty's knowledge affects liability.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): Negligence in not knowing, coupled with the agent's awareness of lacking authority, is another scenario affecting liability.

Given the query:
"A, who acts as the agent of B, concluded a contract with C for sale of land owned by B. However, A had no authority to represent to conclude the contract. In the case that C was negligent in not knowing that A had no authority to represent, even if A knew themselves to have no authority to represent, A is not liable to C as an unauthorized agency."

Justification:
- (query entails **B2**): The query involves a scenario where the counterparty (C) was negligent in not knowing about the agent's (A) lack of authority, and the agent was aware of their lack of authority.
- Considering the directed links and the refined factors, **B2** supports **A2**, which in turn denies **R1**. This means that under specific conditions (like those described in **B2**), the agent might not be liable.

However, upon closer inspection:
- The query actually describes a scenario where C's negligence and A's knowledge of lacking authority should, according to Article 117(2)(ii), still lead to A not being liable due to C's negligence. But this interpretation seems to overlook the nuances of the original provision which suggests that if the person who concluded the contract as an agent knew themselves to have no authority, the exemption from liability due to the counterparty's negligence might not apply directly in a straightforward manner without considering all implications of Article 117.

Given the structure and upon reevaluation:
- The query seems to align with a scenario where **B2** is relevant, but it concludes with A not being liable under specific conditions. This actually (query agree **R1**) because both the query and **R1** are concerned with the liability of an unauthorized agent, although they approach the conclusion from different angles regarding the specifics of liability under certain conditions.

Thus, the final output after careful consideration is:
- (query entails **B2**)
- (query agree **R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, let's break down the task into the required steps.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict established by Article 539-2. This article states that if one party to a contract makes an agreement with a third party to transfer their contractual status and the other party to the contract gives consent, then the contractual status is transferred.

**Root Node (R1):** The contractual status can be transferred to a third party with the consent of the other contracting party.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion represented by the root node.

**Abstract Factor (A1):** Agreement between one of the contracting parties and a third party for the transfer of contractual status.
**Abstract Factor (A2):** Consent from the other party to the contract for the transfer of contractual status.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **Abstract Factor (A1)**, we can refine it as follows:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The agreement is made with a third party to transfer the buyer's contractual status.
  
For **Abstract Factor (A2)**, we can refine it as follows:
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The other party to the contract (e.g., the seller) gives consent for the transfer.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor supports the occurrence of the root legal determination.
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor.
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**

Given the query: "If B makes an agreement with E to transfer contractual status of the buyer to E, regardless of whether A consents, the status of the buyer is transferred to E."

### Analysis
The query involves making an agreement for transferring contractual status, which aligns with **Base-Level Factor (B1)**. However, it specifically mentions "regardless of whether A consents," which seems to contradict the requirement for consent as outlined in **Abstract Factor (A2)** and its base-level factorization.

### Justification
- The query entails **Base-Level Factor (B1)** because both involve an agreement to transfer contractual status.
  - **(query entails B1)**
  
Given that the root node requires consent for the transfer, but the query suggests the transfer occurs regardless of consent:
- The query disagrees with **Root Node (R1)** because R1 stipulates that consent from the other party is necessary for the transfer, which is not considered in the query.
  - **(query disagree R1)**

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of the legal provision and the structure constructed, it's clear that while the query aligns with aspects of transferring contractual status (entailing B1), its disregard for the necessity of consent fundamentally disagrees with the core requirement stipulated by the root node (R1) for such transfers to be valid.

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 602 seeks to establish that a person with no authority of disposition may not grant a lease for a term that exceeds specific periods for different types of leases.

- **Root Node (R1):** A person with no authority of disposition may not grant a lease exceeding specified terms.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The type of property being leased affects the maximum term of the lease.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The authority of disposition influences the validity of a lease contract.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Leases of forest for planting or felling trees are limited to 10 years.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Leases of land other than forest are limited to five years.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Leases of buildings are limited to three years.
- **Base-Level Factor (B4):** Leases of movables are limited to six months.
- **Base-Level Factor (B5):** Lack of authority of disposition invalidates lease contracts exceeding specified terms.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A1)**
- **(B4 supports A1)**
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(B5 supports A2)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation Format
Followed as per instructions.

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root
Given the query: "A person with no authority of disposition may not grant a lease for a term that exceeds the period of the short-term leases."

- **(query entails B1, B2, B3, B4)** because all these base-level factors consider scenarios where leases are limited by their terms due to lack of authority, similar to what the query implies.
- **(query agree R1)** because both the query and the root node (R1) conclude that a person without disposition authority cannot grant leases beyond specified terms. The query directly aligns with the verdict presented in R1.

After careful reconsideration, the justification remains consistent: the query indeed entails base-level factors related to specific lease term limitations and agrees with the root node's conclusion regarding the inability of a person without authority of disposition to grant long-term leases. 

**Output:** 
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)
- (query entails B4)

   - The outcome of Article 137 is that the obligor may not assert the benefit of time stipulation under certain conditions.
   - Therefore, the Root Node (R1) can be stated as: "The obligor cannot assert the benefit of time stipulation."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factors that undermine the legal conclusion (i.e., the obligor asserting the benefit of time stipulation) are:
     - A1: Becoming subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
     - A2: Losing, damaging, or diminishing the security.
     - A3: Failing to provide security when obligated to do so.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A2 (Losing, damaging, or diminishing the security), we can refine it further:
     - B1: The security is not provided as required.
   - For A3 (Failing to provide security when obligated to do so), a base-level factor directly related to our query could be:
     - B2: The obligor has an obligation to provide security but fails to do so.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - Each abstract factor denies the occurrence of the root legal determination.
   - Thus, we have:
     - (A1 denies R1)
     - (A2 denies R1)
     - (A3 denies R1)
   - And for base-level factors:
     - Since B1 is a scenario under A2, and B2 directly relates to A3:
       - (B1 supports A2)
       - (B2 supports A3)

Given the query: "In cases where the obligor of monetary debt has the obligation to provide security, if the security is not provided, the obligor cannot assert the benefit of the time."

- **Justification of Entailment with Base-Level Factors:**
  - The query directly relates to B2 because it discusses a situation where the obligor fails to provide required security.
  - Therefore, (query entails B2).

- **Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node (R1):**
  - Since the query concludes that the obligor cannot assert the benefit of time stipulation when they fail to provide security as obligated, it aligns with the conditions under which R1 is true.
  - Thus, (query agree R1).

Upon re-justification, considering the steps and the structure formed:
- The conclusion remains consistent. The query directly involves a scenario covered by B2, focusing on the failure to provide required security, which supports A3 (failing to provide security).
- This, in turn, denies the obligor's ability to assert the benefit of time stipulation, aligning with R1.

Therefore, the final output is:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a structured approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 542(1) seeks to establish that the obligee may immediately cancel the contract without making a demand under specific circumstances. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** The obligee may immediately cancel the contract without making a demand.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** Impossibility of performance.
- **A2:** Manifestation of intention to refuse performance.
- **A3:** Time-sensitive nature of the contract.
- **A4:** Obligor's likelihood of performance.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- Under **A1: Impossibility of performance**, we have:
  - **B1:** Performance of the whole obligation is impossible.
  - **B2:** Performance of part of the obligation is impossible, and the purpose cannot be achieved by the remaining part.
- Under **A2: Manifestation of intention to refuse performance**, we have:
  - **B3:** Obligor unequivocally manifests the intention to refuse the whole obligation.
  - **B4:** Obligor clearly manifests the intention to refuse part of the obligation, affecting the contract's purpose.
- Under **A3: Time-sensitive nature of the contract**, we consider:
  - **B5:** The contract requires performance at a specific time or within a certain period to achieve its purpose.
- **A4** does not need refinement for this analysis.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor supports the root node, as they provide conditions under which the obligee may immediately cancel the contract:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**
- **(B4 supports A2)**
- **(B5 supports A3)**
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**
- **(A4 supports R1)**

Given the query: "If the performance of part of the obligation is impossible and the purpose of the contract cannot be achieved by the performance of the remaining part of the obligation, then the obligee may immediately cancel the contract without making a demand."

### Justification
The query directly aligns with **B2**, which states that if the performance of part of the obligation is impossible and the purpose cannot be achieved by the remaining part, this supports **A1: Impossibility of performance**. Therefore:
- **(query entails B2)**

This scenario, as described in the query, leads to the conclusion that the obligee may indeed cancel the contract without making a demand, which aligns with **R1**. Thus:
- **(query agree R1)**

Upon reevaluation, considering the specific conditions outlined in the query and how they directly match one of the base-level factors (B2) that support the root node's conclusion (R1), it reinforces the agreement between the query and the root node's verdict. Therefore, the justification holds that the query entails a base-level factor relevant to the scenario described and agrees with the root node on the legal outcome in such circumstances.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a structured approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 364 and Article 467 is to establish that for a pledge over a claim or an assignment of a claim to be duly asserted against a third party obligor or other third parties, notice must be given to that third party obligor in accordance with specific provisions, or consent from the obligor must be obtained.

- **R1**: The creation of a pledge over a claim (including a pledge over a claim which has not yet arisen) may not be duly asserted against a third party obligor and other third parties unless notice of the creation of the pledge is given to that third party obligor or unless that third party obligor gives consent.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors substantiating or undermining the legal conclusion in R1 include:
- **A1**: The requirement for notice to be given to the third party obligor.
- **A2**: The need for consent from the third party obligor as an alternative to notice.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2:
- Under A1, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The use of an instrument bearing a certified date for giving notice.
- Under A2, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: The explicit consent from the obligor that does not require a specific form (such as an instrument with a certified date) but still validates the pledge or assignment.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Notice requirement directly supports the assertion of a pledge against third parties.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Using an instrument with a certified date for notice supports fulfilling the notice requirement.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Consent from the obligor is an alternative that supports the validity of asserting the pledge.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Explicit consent, regardless of form, supports the principle of obtaining consent.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "In cases where a nominative claim where the obligee is an individual is the subject matter of a pledge, to assert the establishment of the pledge against a third party other than the obligator of the claim that is a subject matter of the pledge, the notification or acknowledgement using an instrument bearing a fixed date is required."

- **(Query entails B1)**: The query specifically mentions the use of "an instrument bearing a fixed date" for notification, which aligns with the requirement outlined in B1.
  
### Agreement with Root Node
Considering R1 and the query:
- **(Query agree R1)**: Both the query and R1 emphasize the necessity of proper notice (or consent) to assert a pledge against third parties. The query specifies a scenario where such notice must be given using an instrument with a fixed date, which supports the general principle in R1 that notice or consent is required for asserting a pledge.

### Re-Justification
Upon re-evaluation:
- The alignment between the query's specifics and B1 remains clear because both emphasize the importance of using an instrument with a certified (or fixed) date for notification purposes.
- The agreement between the query and R1 also stands, as both are concerned with the conditions under which a pledge can be asserted against third parties, with the query providing a specific instance that supports the broader principle outlined in R1.

Thus, the final output remains:
- **(Query entails B1)**
- **(Query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 202(1) is that a possessory action does not preclude an action on title, and vice versa. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: A party can simultaneously pursue both a possessory action and an action on title regarding the same movable property.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The existence of possession.
- **A2**: The existence of title.
- **A3**: The independence of possessory actions from actions on title.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1** (Existence of possession):
  - **B1**: Current physical control over the property.
  - **B2**: Legal right to possess the property.
- Under **A2** (Existence of title):
  - **B3**: Ownership documents or proof of ownership.
  - **B4**: Legal recognition as the owner.
- Under **A3** (Independence of possessory actions from actions on title):
  - **B5**: The legal principle that possession and title are separate grounds for action.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor must either support or deny the occurrence of the root legal determination or another abstract factor:
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Possession supports the ability to pursue both types of actions.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): Having title supports the pursuit of both possessory and title-based actions.
- (**A3** supports **R1**): The principle that these actions are independent further supports **R1**.
And each base-level factor must either support or deny its abstract factor:
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Physical control is a form of possession.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): Legal right to possess is another aspect of possession.
- (**B3** supports **A2**): Ownership documents are proof of title.
- (**B4** supports **A2**): Legal recognition as the owner is essential for claiming title.
- (**B5** supports **A3**): The legal principle underpins the independence of these actions.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "B has stolen movable X owned and possessed by A. In this case, A may simultaneously demand B to return X based on ownership and to return X by an action for recovery of possession."

- (**Query entails B1**): The query involves physical control over property (A's original possession).
- (**Query entails B3**): The query mentions ownership, implying title.
- (**Query agrees R1**): Both the query and **R1** conclude that a party can pursue both possessory and title-based actions simultaneously regarding the same movable property.

Upon rejustification, considering the legal principles outlined in Article 202(1) and the specifics of the query:
- The query directly aligns with the root node's conclusion (**R1**) because it describes a scenario where A is pursuing both types of actions against B.
- The base-level factors **B1** (physical control/possession) and **B3** (ownership/title) are relevant to the query, supporting their respective abstract factors which in turn support the root node's conclusion.

Therefore, the output based on the analysis is:
- (**Query entails B1**)
- (**Query entails B3**)
- (**Query agrees R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 552, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1:** A gift that is to be delivered periodically ceases to be effective on the death of the donor or the donee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For Article 552, we can identify:
- **A1:** The condition of periodic delivery of a gift.
- **A2:** The effect of the death of the donor on the gift's effectiveness.
- **A3:** The effect of the death of the donee on the gift's effectiveness.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors helps in addressing specific conditions directly. For our case:
- **B1 (under A2):** The donor's death results in the cessation of the gift's effectiveness.
- **B2 (under A3):** The donee's death leads to the cessation of the gift's effectiveness.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Each abstract factor and base-level factor must have a directed link indicating whether it supports or denies another factor or the root node.
- **(B1 supports A2)**: The donor's death supports the condition that affects the gift's periodic delivery.
- **(B2 supports A3)**: The donee's death supports the condition affecting the gift's effectiveness.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The effect of the donor's death on the gift supports the root conclusion.
- **(A3 supports R1)**: The effect of the donee's death on the gift supports the root conclusion.

### Query Evaluation:
Given the query, "Periodic gifts shall lose its effect on the death of the donee, but they shall not lose its effect even if the donor dies," let's evaluate it against our constructed ANGELIC structure.
- The query directly contradicts **B1**, which states that the donor's death results in the cessation of the gift's effectiveness. However, since the query specifically mentions that the gift does not lose its effect if the donor dies, it actually **disagrees** with the premise underlying **B1** and by extension, **A2**.
- The query agrees with **B2**, which states that the donee's death leads to the cessation of the gift's effectiveness.

### Justification:
- **(query entails B2)**: Because both the query and **B2** consider the scenario where the donee's death affects the periodic gift, leading to its cessation.
- **(query disagrees R1)**: The query fundamentally disagrees with the root conclusion **R1**, which states that the gift ceases to be effective on the death of either the donor or the donee. The query suggests an exception for the donor's death.

Upon reevaluation:
The initial analysis stands because the query directly addresses the conditions under which a periodic gift loses its effectiveness, specifically mentioning the death of the donee as a cessation event but not the death of the donor. This directly aligns with **B2** but contradicts the comprehensive conclusion of **R1**, indicating a disagreement with the root node's verdict in the context provided by the query.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article seeks to establish that the obligor of certain obligations may not duly assert a set-off against the obligee under specific conditions. Therefore, the root node can be identified as:

- **R1**: The obligor may not assert a set-off against the obligee for compensation claims arising from tortious acts.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:

- **A1**: The nature of the obligation (whether it's for compensation based on a tort committed in bad faith).
- **A2**: The type of loss or damage compensated (death, injury to person, excluding those set forth in the preceding item).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining abstract factors:

- Under **A1**, we can have:
  - **B1**: The tort was committed in bad faith.
  - **B2**: The claim is for compensation for loss or damage based on a tort.

- Under **A2**, we can have:
  - **B3**: The compensation is for death.
  - **B4**: The compensation is for injury to person (excluding those set forth in the preceding item).

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Directed links:

- (**B1** supports **A1**): If a tort was committed in bad faith, it supports the conclusion that the obligor may not assert a set-off.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): A claim for compensation based on a tort also supports this conclusion.
- (**B3** supports **A2**): Compensation for death supports the type of loss or damage compensated.
- (**B4** supports **A2**): Compensation for injury to person (under specific exclusions) also supports this.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): The nature of the obligation being for compensation based on a tort in bad faith supports the root conclusion.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): The type of loss or damage compensated (death or injury to person under specific conditions) also supports the root conclusion.

### Justification

Given the query: "Victim A, who was injured by the tort, may not use the claim for compensation for the damage against Perpetrator B to assert set-off, against the loan claim of B against A."

- The query entails **B2** because it involves a claim for compensation based on a tort.
- The query agrees with **R1** because both state that the victim (obligor in the context of the article) may not assert a set-off against the perpetrator (obligee) for compensation claims arising from tortious acts.

After careful consideration and re-justification, the conclusion remains consistent:

- (**query entails B2**): The query involves a scenario where a claim for compensation based on a tort is considered.
- (**query agree R1**): Both the query and **R1** conclude that the obligor (victim) cannot assert a set-off against claims arising from certain types of obligations, specifically those related to tortious acts.

Therefore, the output format justification is:

- (**query entails B2**)
- (**query agree R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 605 seeks to establish that a lease of immovables, when registered, may be duly asserted against a third party such as a person that subsequently acquires real rights with respect to the immovables. Thus, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: A registered lease of immovables is effective against subsequent acquirers of real rights.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors substantiating this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Registration of the lease.
- **A2**: The nature of the property as immovable.
- **A3**: The subsequent acquisition of real rights by a third party.

These abstract factors validate the effectiveness of a registered lease against subsequent acquirers.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining **A1** and **A2** into more specific conditions, we get:
- **B1**: The lease is properly documented and filed according to legal requirements.
- **B2**: The property in question is indeed classified as immovable under the relevant law.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- (**B1 supports A1**): Proper documentation and filing support the validity of the lease's registration.
- (**B2 supports A2**): Classification as immovable directly impacts the applicability of the article to the property in question.
- (**A1 supports R1**), (**A2 supports R1**), and (**A3 supports R1**): Registration, the nature of the property, and subsequent acquisition all support the effectiveness of the lease against third parties.

### Query Analysis:
Given the query "The building lease, when registered, shall also be effective against a person who subsequently acquires real rights with respect to the building, even if the building is not delivered," we can see it involves similar legal principles as Article 605 but specifies conditions (building not being delivered) that might or might not affect the applicability of the article.

### Justification:
- The query considers a scenario where the building lease's effectiveness against subsequent acquirers is questioned, which aligns with **R1** and thus entails considerations similar to those of **B1** (proper registration) and **B2** (nature of property as immovable).
- Specifically, (**query entails B1**) because it discusses the registered state of the lease.
- Since buildings can be considered immovables under many legal systems, and the query doesn't dispute this classification, we might also consider (**query entails B2**), though this is less direct than **B1**.
- The core issue in the query—whether a registered lease remains effective against subsequent acquirers even without delivery of the building—directly pertains to the effectiveness of such leases as described by **R1**. Therefore, (**query agree R1**) because both assert that registration provides a basis for asserting rights against subsequent acquirers, despite additional conditions (like non-delivery) being present in the query.

After re-justification, considering the specifics of the legal principles and the query's scenario:
- The focus on registration and its effects aligns with **R1**'s stance on registered leases.
- The specific mention of "even if the building is not delivered" introduces a condition (non-delivery) that could potentially complicate direct application but doesn't inherently contradict **R1** or imply disagreement.

Thus, the final analysis stands as:
- (**query entails B1**)
- (**query agree R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 562, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The buyer has the right to demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance regarding the kind, quality, or quantity of the subject matter.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the root legal conclusion. From Article 562, we can derive:
- **A1**: The subject matter does not conform to the terms of the contract.
- **A2**: The non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2** into more specific conditions:
- **B1** (under **A1**): The defect in the subject matter is significant.
- **B2** (under **A1**): Excessive costs would not be required for repair.
- **B3** (under **A2**): The buyer's actions or omissions caused the non-conformity.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Non-conformity of the subject matter supports the buyer's right to demand correction.
- (**A2** denies **R1**): If the non-conformity is due to the buyer, it denies the buyer's right to demand correction.
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Significant defects support the claim of non-conformity.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): Repair not requiring excessive costs supports the feasibility of correcting non-conformity.
- (**B3** supports **A2**): Buyer-caused issues support the grounds for denying the buyer's demand.

### Analysis of Query
The query mentions that even if there is a defect in the subject matter, the party ordering the work may not demand repair if the defect is not significant and excessive costs would be required. This scenario directly relates to **B1** and **B2**, as it discusses the significance of the defect and the cost of repair.

### Justification
- The query entails a consideration similar to **B1** and **B2** because it talks about the significance of defects and the cost of repair, which are crucial in determining whether the buyer can demand correction.
- Therefore, (query entails B1) and (query entails B2).
  
Regarding the agreement with the root node **R1**, the query suggests that under certain conditions (non-significant defect and excessive repair costs), the party ordering the work may not demand repair. This aligns with a nuanced interpretation of **R1** that considers the feasibility and reasonableness of demanding correction, rather than an absolute right to demand it regardless of circumstances.

- Hence, in a comparable situation where the focus is on the buyer's right to demand correction considering the specifics of non-conformity (like significance and cost), the query agrees with **R1** when understood in the context of practical application and reasonableness.
- Therefore, (query agree R1).

After rejustification, considering the emphasis on specific conditions that might limit or modify the buyer's right to demand correction, it's clear that both the original analysis and the rejustification lead to the same conclusion regarding the query's relationship with **B1**, **B2**, and **R1**.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions regarding the administration of absentee property, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 25(1) seeks to establish that if an absentee has not appointed an administrator for their property, the family court may order necessary dispositions with regard to the administration of that property. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:

- **R1**: The family court may order administration of an absentee's property.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors substantiating or undermining this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The absence of an appointed administrator for the absentee's property.
- **A2**: The authority of the appointed administrator being extinguished during the absence.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining **A1** and **A2**:
- **B1**: The absentee has not appointed an administrator for their property before leaving.
- **B2**: An administrator was appointed, but their authority ended during the absentee's absence.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Directed links:
- (**B1 supports A1**): Not having an administrator directly supports the condition for court intervention.
- (**B2 supports A1**): The end of an administrator's authority also supports the need for court action.
- (**A1 supports R1**): The lack of an administrator (or their authority) supports the court's decision to administer the property.
- (**A2 supports R1**): Similarly, if an administrator's authority is extinguished, it supports the court's intervention.

### Justification

Given the query: "Absentee means a person who has taken leave of the domicile or residence up until then and whose whereabouts are unable to ascertain."

This definition focuses on the condition of being an absentee rather than directly addressing the administration of property. However, it implies a scenario where **B1** (the absence of an appointed administrator) might be relevant because if someone's whereabouts are unknown, they likely haven't appointed an administrator or the administrator cannot act effectively.

- (**query entails B1**): The query situation (an absentee with unknown whereabouts) could imply that no administrator has been appointed or can function, which aligns with **B1**.

Regarding agreement with the root node:
- The query itself does not directly address whether the court should intervene in administering the property. It focuses on defining an absentee.
- However, if we consider the implication of being unable to ascertain the whereabouts of the absentee, it might support the need for administration (**R1**), as the absence and lack of known administrator could necessitate court action.

Therefore:
- (**query agree R1**): The query's scenario (defining an absentee) indirectly supports the conditions under which **R1** (the family court may order administration of an absentee's property) would be applicable, given the likely absence of effective administration.

Upon re-justification, considering the direct implications and the structure formed:
- The query directly relates to the definition of an absentee rather than the administration process itself. However, it sets a context where **B1** (absence of an administrator) might be true, indirectly supporting **R1** under the conditions described in Article 25(1).

Thus, the conclusion stands with the understanding that the query's scenario supports the base-level factor related to the absence of administration and indirectly agrees with the root node concerning the potential need for court intervention in property administration.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the query in relation to this structure, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the articles seeks to establish the legal conclusions regarding contracts for value, including provisions for non-conformity of performance, compensation for loss or damage, and the right to cancel. A specific root node could be:
- R1: The buyer has the right to demand cure for non-conformity in contracts for value.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The subject matter does not conform to the terms of the contract.
- A2: The non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer.
- A3: The seller's ability to cure the non-conformity without imposing undue burden on the buyer.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- B1 (under A1): The subject matter delivered does not match the kind, quality, or quantity specified in the contract.
- B2 (under A2): The buyer's actions directly caused the non-conformity of the subject matter.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 denies A1, because if the non-conformity is due to the buyer, it may undermine the buyer's right to demand cure)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 denies R1)
- (A3 supports R1)

### Applying the Query
Given query: "Where no delivery of the subject matter is required, the duration of contractor's warranty commences to run from the time of the completion of the work."

This query seems to introduce a scenario not directly addressed by the derived factors but implies a condition where the focus is on the timing of the warranty rather than the non-conformity and cure process. However, considering the essence of contracts for value and performance:
- The query does not directly address the buyer's right to demand cure for non-conformity based on delivery of subject matter or its characteristics but touches upon a related aspect of contractual obligations (warranty duration).
- It can be argued that this scenario considers evidence in a similar situation where contractual terms and performances are crucial, thus potentially relating to base-level factors indirectly by discussing contract specifics.

However, the direct linkage to our derived structure is not clear-cut because our structure focuses on non-conformity and cure, while the query discusses warranty duration without specifying non-conformity or cure processes. 

Given this, a careful interpretation suggests that:
- (query entails B1) could be considered if we stretch the scenario to include how non-delivery might imply a different kind of "non-conformity" at the completion of work, but it's a bit of a stretch.
- The query does not directly agree or disagree with R1 regarding the buyer's right to demand cure for non-conformity. Instead, it discusses a related contractual aspect (warranty duration) without addressing the core issue of demanding cure.

Thus, upon careful consideration and given the complexity of directly linking the query to our derived factors without over-interpreting:
- The query seems more aligned with discussing contractual specifics rather than directly supporting or denying R1. Therefore, it might not be accurately represented as agreeing or disagreeing with R1 based on the information provided.

Re-justification leads to recognizing that while there's a thematic connection between contracts and performance, the specific focus areas (non-conformity vs. warranty duration) mean the query doesn't neatly fit into our structure without assuming additional context not provided in the articles or the query itself.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and query, we'll follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 200(1) by answering the question: What legal conclusion or verdict does the article seek to establish or refute?
- **Root Node (R1):** A possessor who is forcibly dispossessed may demand restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The possession was taken forcibly.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The possessor has the right to claim restitution based on ownership or possessory rights.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into distinct base-level factors:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The possession was taken without the consent of the possessor, directly relating to A1.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The possessor had acquired possessory rights through constructive transfer, directly relating to A2.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each factor's relationship:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Forcible taking without consent supports the fact that possession was taken forcibly.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Acquisition of possessory rights through constructive transfer supports the possessor's right to claim restitution.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The forcible nature of the dispossession supports the possessor's right to demand restitution and compensation.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Having possessory rights supports the legal basis for demanding restitution.

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation
Already applied in the step-by-step breakdown.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: (A) bought the movable "a" from (B) and A acquired possessory right by constructive transfer, however B is forcibly dispossessed the movable "a" by (C). In this case, A may claim for the restoration of the movable "a" against C not only based on the ownership but also by bringing an action for recovery of possession.

- **(query entails B2)**: Because both scenarios involve acquiring possessory rights and then facing dispossession.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query's conclusion that A can claim restoration aligns with the root node's determination regarding restitution after forcible dispossession.

After careful consideration, this analysis holds because the query directly involves a scenario where possessory rights are acquired through constructive transfer (aligning with B2), and the action taken (claiming restoration) is in line with what R1 establishes as a legal conclusion following forcible dispossession. 

Therefore, the output based on the analysis is:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 657-2 seeks to establish the conditions under which a bailor or bailee may cancel a bailment contract. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A bailor or bailee may cancel a bailment contract under specific conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the cancellation of a bailment contract include:
- **A1**: The type of bailment (gratuitous or for value).
- **A2**: The existence of a written agreement.
- **A3**: The timing and conditions of delivery of the bailed thing.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The bailment is for value.
  - **B2**: The bailment is gratuitous.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: The bailment is made in writing.
  - **B4**: The bailment is not made in writing.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B5**: The bailee receives the bailed thing before cancellation.
  - **B6**: The bailor fails to deliver the bailed thing after a specified reasonable period.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Directed links:
- (**B1 supports A1**): Having a bailment for value supports the consideration of type of bailment affecting contract cancellation.
- (**B2 supports A1**): Being a gratuitous bailment also affects conditions for cancellation.
- (**B3 denies A2's support for R1 in case of gratuitous bailee**): A written agreement may restrict a gratuitous bailee's ability to cancel, thus denying the general applicability of A2 in supporting R1 for all cases.
- (**B4 supports A2**): Lack of a written agreement affects cancellation conditions, particularly for bailments not made in writing.
- (**B5 denies R1**): If the bailee has already received the bailed thing, it generally denies the possibility of cancellation based on non-receipt.
- (**B6 supports R1**): Failure to deliver after a specified period supports the condition under which a contract can be canceled.

### Justification

Given the query: "A bailee of a bailment contract for value not made in writing may cancel the contract up until the bailee receives the bailed thing."

- The query entails **B1** (the bailment is for value) and **B4** (the bailment is not made in writing), focusing on a specific scenario where both conditions are true.
- Considering **B1** and **B4**, these support **A1** (type of bailment) and **A2** (existence of a written agreement), respectively. 
- The query specifically mentions cancellation up until the bailee receives the bailed thing, which aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 657-2(1) for a bailor but is less directly addressed for a bailee. However, given the structure and focusing on the bailee's perspective in a bailment for value not made in writing, we can see that **B5** (bailee receives the bailed thing before cancellation) would deny R1 if considering from the perspective of after receipt, but since the query is about up until receipt, it actually aligns more with conditions allowing cancellation before receipt.
- Thus, the query **entails B1** and given its focus on a specific scenario, it also implies agreement with the principle behind **R1**, as it discusses conditions under which a bailment contract can be canceled. Therefore, **(query entails B1)** and considering the broader context of cancellation conditions, **(query agree R1)**.

After re-justification, considering the specifics of the query and the structure provided:
- The final assessment remains that the query aligns with the conditions for canceling a bailment contract as outlined, specifically focusing on a scenario involving a bailment for value not made in writing.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)** and, upon careful consideration of the context and the specifics of bailment contract cancellations, **(query agree R1)**.

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 714 seeks to establish that a person with the statutory obligation to supervise a person without capacity to assume responsibility is liable to compensate for damage inflicted by the latter on a third party, under certain conditions.

- **Root Node (R1):** A person with the statutory obligation to supervise is liable for damages caused by a person without capacity to assume responsibility.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- The existence of a statutory obligation to supervise.
- The failure to perform the supervision obligation.
- The infliction of damage on a third party by the person without capacity to assume responsibility.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Existence of a statutory obligation to supervise.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Failure to perform the supervision obligation.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Infliction of damage on a third party.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A2, we get:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The supervisor did not neglect their obligation to supervise.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The damage could have been avoided if the supervisor had performed their obligation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)
- (A3 supports R1)
- (B1 denies A2)
- (B2 denies A2)

Given the query: "If a plaintiff files against a person with the legal obligation to supervise a person without capacity to assume liability as a defendant, and demands compensation of damages based on the liability of the person with the obligation to supervise a person without capacity to assume liability in Civil Code Article 714, Paragraph 1, the defendant may assert that he/she did not neglect his/her obligation to supervise as an affirmative defense."

**Justification:**
- The query entails **B1** because it considers a scenario where the defendant (the person with the legal obligation to supervise) asserts they did not neglect their supervision obligation, which directly corresponds to Base-Level Factor B1.
- To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with **R1**, we must consider whether the scenario presented by the query aligns with the conditions under which a person with the statutory obligation to supervise is liable. The query presents a situation where the defendant asserts no negligence in supervision, which could potentially exempt them from liability according to Article 714, Paragraph 1. Therefore, the query does not straightforwardly agree with R1 but rather presents a condition (B1) that denies A2, thereby potentially denying R1 under specific circumstances.

**Output:**
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances of legal argumentation and the specifics of Article 714, the conclusion remains that the query entails a base-level factor related to the assertion of no negligence in supervision (B1) and, by asserting a condition that could negate liability, does not align with the root node's establishment of liability under the described conditions.

 To address the given problem, let's follow the step-by-step approach to construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 465-3 seeks to establish rules regarding the principal crystallization date in contracts for revolving guarantee by an individual for loans. Specifically, it aims to determine when such a contract can be considered invalid or under what conditions the principal crystallization date is deemed effective.

**Root Node (R1):** A contract for revolving guarantee on loans is invalid if it does not comply with the specified regulations regarding the principal crystallization date.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:

- **A1:** The presence of a provision for the principal crystallization date in the contract.
- **A2:** Compliance with the time frames stipulated by law for the principal crystallization date.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining abstract factors into base-level factors, we have:

- Under **A1:**
  - **B1:** The contract does not provide a principal crystallization date.
  - **B2:** The contract provides for a principal crystallization date that falls on or after the day five years have passed since the contract's conclusion.

- Under **A2:**
  - **B3:** The change in the principal crystallization date makes it fall later than five years after the change, without meeting specific exceptions.
  - **B4:** The contract or its changes comply with the stipulated time frames (e.g., within three years from the contract's conclusion).

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- **(A1 supports R1):** If a contract lacks a principal crystallization date provision, it supports the conclusion that the contract is invalid.
- **(B1 supports A1):** The absence of a principal crystallization date directly supports factor A1.
- **(B2 denies A1):** Providing a principal crystallization date, even if after five years, denies or undermines factor A1, as it indicates some level of compliance with the need for such a date.
- **(A2 denies R1):** Compliance with legal time frames (e.g., having a principal crystallization date within specified limits) denies the conclusion that the contract is invalid due to non-compliance with these regulations.

### Justification

Given the query: "A contract for revolving guarantee on loans shall be invalid, in the cases where it does not provide a principal determination date."

- **(Query entails B1):** The query directly aligns with base-level factor B1, which states that the contract does not provide a principal crystallization date.
  
- **(Query disagree R1):** Upon closer examination, while the query and root node both discuss conditions under which a contract for revolving guarantee on loans might be considered invalid, they frame the issue slightly differently. The root node (R1) is focused on non-compliance with regulations regarding the principal crystallization date as a broader condition of invalidity, whereas the query specifically highlights the absence of a principal determination date as a condition for invalidity. According to Article 465-3(2), if a contract does not provide for a principal crystallization date (or if such provisions do not become effective), the law stipulates that the principal crystallization date shall fall on the day three years have passed from the contract's conclusion, implying the contract is not necessarily invalid but rather is subject to specific legal interpretations regarding its terms. Thus, the query and root node R1 are not in perfect agreement regarding the conditions under which a contract would be deemed invalid solely due to the absence of a principal crystallization date provision.

Therefore, upon careful consideration, it's clear that while the query touches on an important aspect of contracts for revolving guarantee by an individual for loans, its focus is narrower than the broader legal conclusion encapsulated in R1. The initial justification overlooked the nuanced stipulations provided in Article 465-3(2), which essentially provides a default condition (three years from the contract's conclusion) when no principal crystallization date is specified or becomes effective, thereby not necessarily rendering the contract invalid due to this specific omission alone. 

Given this analysis:
- **(Query entails B1).**
- **(Query disagree R1).**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 652 and its relation to Article 620 is that when a mandate or lease is cancelled, the cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future, without precluding claims for compensation for loss or damage. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: Cancellation of a mandate/lease is effective solely towards the future.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: The nature of cancellation in contractual agreements.
- A2: The principle of non-retrospective effect in contract law.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- B1 (under A1): Cancellation due to default does not affect past obligations or performances.
- B2 (under A2): The principle that legal effects of a cancellation do not extend before the point of cancellation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Given the context, we establish:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Now, given the query: "In cases where a mandate is cancelled for default, the cancellation shall be effective solely toward the future."

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root:
- The query directly pertains to the scenario described by Base-Level Factor B1, as both consider the effect of cancellation due to default on the temporal applicability of the cancellation. Thus, **(query entails B1)**.
- Since B1 supports A1, and A1 in turn supports R1, the query indirectly supports R1. Moreover, the query's statement about the future effectiveness of cancellation aligns with the root node R1's conclusion regarding the prospective effect of cancellation. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After re-justification, considering the direct relationship between the query and B1, as well as the alignment of the query with the principles outlined in R1 through A1 and A2, the conclusions remain consistent. The query's focus on default cancellations being effective solely toward the future aligns with the legal framework established by Articles 652 and 620, supporting both a specific base-level factor (B1) and the overarching root node conclusion (R1).

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article seeks to establish that if a performer concludes a contract with the obligee to make another type of payment or delivery in lieu of what the obligor is supposed to perform, and the performer makes that other type of payment or delivery, it has the same effect as the performance of the obligation.

- **Root Node (R1):** The performance of an alternative payment or delivery by a third party (performer) can extinguish the original obligation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The existence of a valid contract between the performer and the obligee for an alternative performance.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The actual performance of the alternative payment or delivery by the performer.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1, we get:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The contract must specify an alternative type of payment or delivery that is acceptable to both parties.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The performer must have the capacity and right to perform the obligation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(A1 supports R1):** A valid contract between the performer and the obligee directly supports the conclusion that an alternative performance can extinguish the original obligation.
- **(B1 supports A1):** The specification of an acceptable alternative payment or delivery in the contract supports the validity of the contract for this purpose.
- **(B2 supports A1):** The capacity and right of the performer to perform support the effectiveness of the contract.

Given the query: "The obligee(B) may not perform the obligation which he/she contracts with a third party by assigning the claim which the obligor(A) contracts with the obligee(B) to the third party as a substitute against the will of the obligor(A)."

Justifying whether the query entails base-level factors and its agreement or disagreement with the root:
- The query is about the assignment of claims without the consent of the obligor, which doesn't directly relate to the scenario where a performer contracts for an alternative performance. However, it touches on the theme of substituting obligations or performances.
- **(query entails B1):** In a sense, because both involve scenarios where obligations are being altered or substituted (either through direct performance by a third party or assignment of claims), but they operate under different contexts and conditions.

Considering whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root:
- The root node is about the effect of an alternative payment or delivery made by a performer. The query, however, questions the ability to assign obligations without consent, which does not directly align with the scenario described in R1 but does touch on similar themes of obligation and performance.
- **(query disagree R1):** Because the query implies limitations on substituting performances (assigning claims) against the will of one party, whereas R1 establishes a scenario where an alternative performance can be made with the agreement of parties involved.

Upon rejustification:
- The initial interpretation holds. The query's focus on assignment without consent does not align perfectly with the root's focus on alternative performances agreed upon by all relevant parties.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)** because both involve substitution in obligations, but under different circumstances and mechanisms (direct performance vs. claim assignment).
- And, **(query disagree R1)**, as the query suggests limitations or concerns about substituting obligations without consent, which contrasts with the root's positive assertion about agreed-upon alternative performances extinguishing original obligations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B1), (query disagree R1)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 120 seeks to establish that an act voidable due to qualified legal capacity issues or due to mistake, fraud, or duress can only be rescinded under specific conditions by specific individuals. The root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** A juristic act voidable on grounds of qualified legal capacity or mistake, fraud, or duress can be rescinded only by specified persons.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion in R1 include:
- **A1:** The act was performed with qualified legal capacity to act.
- **A2:** The act was affected by mistake, fraud, or duress.
- **A3:** The rescission is made by a person with authority (the person who did the act, their agent, successor, or someone with consent authority).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1 and A2 into more specific base-level factors:
- **B1:** The person performing the act was a minor without statutory agent consent.
- **B2:** The act involved mistake, fraud, or duress directly influencing the person's decision.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Directed links:
- **(A1 supports R1):** Having qualified legal capacity to act is crucial for determining who can rescind a voidable act.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The presence of mistake, fraud, or duress directly impacts who can rescind the act.
- **(A3 supports R1):** Only specified persons have the authority to rescind such acts.
- **(B1 denies A1):** If a minor acted without consent, it challenges the qualified legal capacity aspect.
- **(B2 supports A2):** Acts involving mistake, fraud, or duress are directly related to grounds for rescission.

### Analysis of Query

Given query: "A minor may rescind the juristic act which is performed without the consent of his/her statutory agent individually."

- **(Query entails B1):** The scenario described in the query aligns with the conditions outlined in base-level factor B1, as it involves a minor acting without statutory agent consent.
  
### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node

Comparing the query to R1:
- The query suggests a specific condition (a minor acting individually) under which a juristic act might be rescinded. However, according to Article 120, such an act can only be rescinded by the person with qualified legal capacity or their agent/successor, implying that a minor without statutory consent may not have the authority to rescind it individually based on the general principle outlined.
  
- **(Query disagree R1):** The query's scenario seems to contradict the conditions set forth in R1 regarding who can rescind a voidable act, as it implies a broader scope of action for minors than what Article 120 suggests.

### Rejustification

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of Article 120 and the implications of qualified legal capacity:
- The initial analysis stands because the article clearly outlines specific conditions under which an act can be rescinded, focusing on the capacity to act and the authority to rescind. A minor acting without statutory agent consent does indeed reflect a scenario where qualified legal capacity is in question (supporting B1), but it contradicts the principle that such acts can only be rescinded by those with specified authority or capacity (thus disagreeing with R1).

Therefore, the final justification confirms:
- **(Query entails B1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of the article is that if no notice of cancellation is received within a specified reasonable period after a demand for a definite answer, the right to cancel is extinguished.
   - Thus, the Root Node can be labeled as R1: "The right to cancel is extinguished if no cancellation notice is received within the specified period."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Key legal factors include the issuance of a notice of demand by one party to another, specifying a reasonable period for response regarding the exercise of the cancellation right.
   - Another factor could be the failure to receive a cancellation notice within that specified period.
   - Thus, we have two Abstract Factors:
     - A1: "Issuance of a notice of demand with a reasonable time frame."
     - A2: "No cancellation notice received within the specified period."

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, a refinement could be the specifics of how the notice is issued and what constitutes a "reasonable" period.
   - For A2, a refinement could involve the implications of not receiving a cancellation notice within that timeframe on the right to cancel.
   - Thus, we refine these into Base-Level Factors:
     - B1: "The notice of demand is issued in accordance with legal procedures."
     - B2: "A reasonable period for response is clearly specified in the notice."
     - B3: "The absence of a cancellation notice within the timeframe implies waiver of the right to cancel."

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - B1 supports A1 because proper issuance of the notice is crucial for the validity of the demand.
   - B2 supports A1 as specifying a reasonable period is essential for the demand's legitimacy.
   - B3 supports A2 since it directly addresses the consequence of not receiving a cancellation notice within the specified timeframe.

Given these steps, we have:
- R1: "The right to cancel is extinguished if no cancellation notice is received within the specified period."
- A1: "Issuance of a notice of demand with a reasonable time frame."
- A2: "No cancellation notice received within the specified period."
- B1: "The notice of demand is issued in accordance with legal procedures."
- B2: "A reasonable period for response is clearly specified in the notice."
- B3: "The absence of a cancellation notice within the timeframe implies waiver of the right to cancel."
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A1)
- (B3 supports A2)

Now, addressing the query:
"The query entails base-level factors considering evidence in similar situations or scenarios."

Given the query's context about the right to cancel based on failure to perform and the effect of not receiving a cancellation notice after a demand for a definite answer within a reasonable period, it aligns closely with B3. This is because both the query and B3 consider the scenario where the absence of a response (cancellation notice) leads to the extinction of the right to cancel.

Thus, **(query entails B3)**.

Next, comparing the query's verdict with R1's:
- The query states that if no notice of cancellation is received within the specified period after a demand for a definite answer, the right to cancel shall be extinguished.
- This directly aligns with R1: "The right to cancel is extinguished if no cancellation notice is received within the specified period."

Therefore, **(query agrees R1)**.

Upon re-justification, these conclusions hold as both the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure focus on the extinction of the right to cancel due to the lack of a timely response to a demand for a definite answer regarding cancellation.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the query against this framework, we follow the steps outlined below:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 306 and Article 308 can be summarized into a single root node for simplicity:
- **R1**: A person has a statutory lien over the entire assets of the obligor under specified conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
From the articles, we identify key legal factors that validate or invalidate the conclusion:
- **A1**: Expenses for the common benefit.
- **A2**: Employer-employee relationship claims, including salaries and other related claims.
- **A3**: Funeral expenses.
- **A4**: Supply of daily necessaries.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A2** for clarity:
- **B1**: Unpaid salary claims arising from an employer-employee relationship.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A2)**: Since unpaid salary is a claim that arises from the employer-employee relationship.
- **(A1 supports R1)**, **(A2 supports R1)**, **(A3 supports R1)**, and **(A4 supports R1)**: Each of these conditions supports the existence of a statutory lien.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the above steps:
- **Existence of a Root Node (R)**: R1 exists.
- **Single Directed Linkage**: Established for each factor.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships**: Clearly defined.
- **Node Naming Convention**: Followed as per instructions.

### Query Justification
The query states, "If a company does not pay salary, the employee shall have a statutory lien with respect to the salary, regardless of the unpaid period, over the entire property of the company."
- **(query entails B1)**: Because both deal with unpaid salaries in an employer-employee context.
- To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with R1:
  - The query specifies a condition (unpaid salary) that falls under A2 (employer-employee relationship claims), which supports R1 (having a statutory lien over the entire assets of the obligor).
  - Thus, **(query agree R1)**: Both conclude in favor of the employee having a statutory lien under the specified conditions.

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and relationships established:
- The query directly pertains to unpaid salary claims, which is a base-level factor (B1) supporting the abstract factor A2.
- This, in turn, supports the root node R1, indicating that the query aligns with the legal conclusion regarding statutory liens for employer-employee relationship claims.

Therefore, the output based on the provided format and justification is:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 116 seeks to establish that ratification is retroactive to the time of the conclusion of the contract unless a particular intention is manifested, without prejudicing the rights of a third party.

- **Root Node (R1):** Ratification of a contract by a principal makes the contract effective from its initial conclusion, subject to specific intentions or third-party rights.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- The manifestation of a particular intention regarding the timing of the ratification's effect.
- The presence and potential prejudice to the rights of a third party.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Particular Intention Manifested
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Rights of Third Parties

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The principal explicitly states that the ratification should be effective from a future date.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The contract specifies conditions under which the ratification applies retroactively.

Refining A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Third-party rights are unaffected by the timing of the ratification's effect.
- **Base-Level Factor (B4):** Retroactive ratification would prejudice existing contractual obligations with third parties.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Manifestation of a particular intention can influence the effective date of the ratification, thus supporting the root node's conditionality.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: If the rights of third parties are prejudiced, it could deny the retroactive effect of the ratification, hence denying the root node under certain conditions.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: An explicit statement about future effectiveness supports the concept of a particular intention being manifested.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: Specified conditions for retroactivity support the idea that there's an intention behind how and when ratification applies.
- **(B3 supports A2)**: Unaffected third-party rights support the notion that their rights are a consideration in the ratification process.
- **(B4 denies A2)**: Prejudice to third-party rights would deny the general principle of protecting their interests, thereby influencing the ratification's timing.

Given the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure:
- The query states, "In cases where the principal ratifies the contract concluded by a person without authority of agency, the contract shall be effective toward the future from the time of ratification, unless other intention is manifested."
- This implies that the query considers scenarios where there's an explicit or implicit intention about when the ratification should take effect, similar to **Base-Level Factor (B1)**.

Therefore, **(query entails B1)** because both consider the scenario where the timing of the contract's effectiveness is influenced by the manifestation of a particular intention regarding ratification.

Comparing the query with the root node:
- The query suggests that contracts are effective from the future time of ratification unless another intention is manifested.
- This aligns with **Root Node (R1)**, which states that ratification makes a contract effective from its initial conclusion subject to specific intentions or third-party rights.

Thus, **(query agree R1)** because both essentially convey that the effectiveness of a ratified contract can be influenced by the timing of the ratification and any manifested intentions, with considerations for third-party rights implicitly included in the broader context of contract law principles. 

After re-justification:
The conclusion remains consistent; the query does entail a consideration similar to **Base-Level Factor (B1)** regarding the influence of manifested intentions on the effectiveness of ratified contracts. Moreover, it agrees with **Root Node (R1)** on the conditional retroactivity of ratification based on specific intentions or rights of third parties.

Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 398-12(1) is that before the principal is crystallized, a revolving mortgagee may assign a revolving mortgage with the approval of the mortgagor of the revolving mortgage.
- **Root Node (R1):** A revolving mortgagee can assign a revolving mortgage before the principal is crystallized.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Approval from the mortgagor.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The state of the principal (whether crystallized or not).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific base-level factors:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Obtaining approval from the mortgagor before assigning the mortgage.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The principal of the revolving mortgage being in a non-crystallized state.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Having the mortgagor's approval directly supports the condition that allows for the assignment.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The principal being non-crystallized is a direct requirement for the mortgagee to assign the mortgage.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: With the mortgagor's approval, the revolving mortgage can be assigned, supporting the root conclusion.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: If the principal is not crystallized, it supports the condition under which the assignment can occur.

Given the query: "Before the principal is crystallized, a revolving mortgagee may assign a revolving mortgage, with the approval of the mortgagor of the revolving mortgage."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query implies that the approval from the mortgagor (B1) is necessary for the assignment.
- **(query entails B2)**: It also directly states that the principal must be non-crystallized, aligning with B2.

Comparing the query to the root node:
- **(query agree R1)**: The query and R1 both conclude that a revolving mortgagee can assign a revolving mortgage before the principal is crystallized, provided there's approval from the mortgagor. This indicates agreement on the conditions under which such an assignment is permissible.

Upon reevaluation:
The conclusion remains consistent; the query directly supports both base-level factors (B1 and B2) that are necessary for the root node's condition to be met. Thus, it aligns with the root node's verdict in a comparable situation.

Therefore, the final output is:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article seeks to establish that a person who has begun to manage a business for another without being obligated to do so must manage that business in the best interests of the principal.

- **Root Node (R1):** A manager must engage in benevolent intervention in another's business, acting in the best interest of the principal.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors include:
- The manager's obligation to act in the best interests of the principal.
- Knowledge or ability to conjecture the principal's intentions.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The manager's duty to manage the business according to its nature and in the way that best suits the interests of the principal.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The manager's awareness or ability to infer the principal's intentions regarding how the business should be managed.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
For A1, a base-level factor could be:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The manager acts in accordance with standard business practices that benefit the principal.
For A2, a base-level factor could be:
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The manager has explicit or implicit knowledge of the principal's specific intentions for managing the business.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Acting in the best interests of the principal directly supports the root node's requirement.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Knowing or being able to conjecture the principal's intentions supports managing the business as required by the root node.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Following standard beneficial practices supports fulfilling the duty to manage in the best interests of the principal.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Having knowledge of the principal's intentions directly supports being aware or able to infer those intentions.

### Justification:
Given the query, "Even in cases when a parent, based on the authority of parents determined under the law, performs the business of the child as a statutory agent, Management of Business is established," we can analyze its relationship with the constructed ANGELIC structure:

- **(Query entails B1)**: The scenario where a parent manages a child's business implies acting in the best interest of the child (the principal), which aligns with standard beneficial practices.
- **(Query agrees R1)**: Both the query and R1 support the notion that managing another's business requires acting in their best interests, even when the management is based on legal authority such as parental rights.

After rejustification, considering the specifics of the scenario presented by the query and how it relates to the duties outlined in the article, the conclusion remains consistent. The query presents a specific situation where the management of business is established under legal authority, which still falls under the broader principle of acting in the best interest of the principal (in this case, the child). Thus, both the base-level factor and the root node are in agreement with the scenario presented by the query.

Output:
- (Query entails B1)
- (Query agrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's first break down the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome or legal conclusion we're focusing on is related to the management of a business for another person without being obligated to do so and the rights of such a manager, particularly in terms of reimbursement for expenses or obligations incurred. 
- **Root Node (R1):** A manager who has begun to manage a business for another person without obligation may claim reimbursement for beneficial expenses or demand performance of beneficial obligations from the principal.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The manager's actions were in the best interest of the principal.
- **A2:** The manager knew or could conjecture the intentions of the principal and acted accordingly.
- **A3:** The obligations incurred by the manager were necessary for the administration of the business.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A3, we get:
- **B1:** The obligation has fallen due.
- **B2:** The manager incurred the obligation without negligence and it was necessary for the business.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1):** Knowing the principal's intentions supports the manager's claim.
- **(A2 supports R1):** Acting in the best interest of the principal supports the manager's claim.
- **(B1 supports A3):** If the obligation has fallen due, it supports that the obligations were necessary and thus valid for reimbursement or performance.
- **(B2 supports A3):** Necessary and non-negligent obligations support the validity of the manager's actions.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "In cases where a person who commences the management of a business for another person without being obligated to do so has incurred useful obligations on behalf of the principal, if the obligation has fallen due, he/she may demand that the principal perform the obligation on his/her behalf."

- **(Query entails B1):** The query specifically mentions "if the obligation has fallen due," which aligns with Base-Level Factor B1.
  
### Agreement with Root Node
- **(Query agree R1):** The scenario described in the query leads to a conclusion that agrees with the Root Node (R1). Both assert the manager's right to demand performance of obligations from the principal under certain conditions, such as when the obligation has fallen due and was incurred in the best interest of the principal.

After careful consideration, the justification provided seems to align well with the logical structure of the legal provisions and the query's context. The query directly references a condition (obligation having fallen due) that is integral to the manager's ability to demand performance from the principal, as outlined in the base-level factor B1 and supported by the abstract factors leading up to the root node R1.

Therefore, the output based on the given instructions is:
- **(Query entails B1)**
- **(Query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 6 seeks to establish that a minor permitted to conduct business has the same capacity to act as an adult in that business, with certain conditions applying if they cannot sustain it. Thus, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A minor's legal capacity to act like an adult in permitted business activities.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors substantiating or undermining this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Permission from a statutory agent for the minor to conduct business.
- **A2**: The minor's ability to sustain the business.
- **A3**: Legal actions unrelated to the permitted business.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: Explicit consent for specific business activities from the statutory agent.
- Under **A2**, a refinement is:
  - **B2**: Evidence of the minor's incapacity to manage or sustain the permitted business.
- Under **A3**, considering actions outside the scope of permitted business:
  - **B3**: Performance of acts unrelated to the business without consent from the statutory agent.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are established as follows:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Explicit consent supports the notion that a minor has permission for business activities.
- **(B2 denies A2)**: Evidence of incapacity to sustain the business denies the minor's full capacity in that business.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Permission from a statutory agent supports a minor's legal capacity in permitted businesses.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The ability to sustain the business supports the minor's capacity to act like an adult in it.
- **(A3 denies R1)**: Legal actions unrelated to the business without consent can deny or complicate the minor's capacity in that specific context.

### Query Analysis
Given the query, "If a minor, after getting permission for carrying a business from his/her statutory agent, performs an act unrelated to the business without getting consent of the statutory agent, that act may not be rescinded."
- **(query entails B3)**: The scenario in the query directly involves performing acts unrelated to the permitted business without consent.
  
Considering the structure and focusing on the comparable situation:
- The query essentially discusses a scenario where a minor's action outside the scope of their permitted business activities might not be subject to rescission. This is somewhat tangential to the main capacity issue but touches upon the boundaries of a minor's legal actions when they have been granted adult-like capacity in specific business matters.

### Agreement with Root Node
The query does not directly address the core of **R1**, which is about a minor's capacity to act like an adult in permitted businesses. However, it implies a scenario where despite having such capacity, their actions outside that scope might still be subject to different legal treatment. Thus, there isn't a direct agreement or disagreement with **R1** based on the query's focus.

Upon careful consideration and re-justification:
- The core issue in the query relates to acts outside the permitted business scope, which introduces complexity regarding the minor's overall capacity as granted by Article 6.
- However, the structure primarily focuses on the capacity within the business context, making the direct link between the query and **R1** more about implications of such capacity rather than a straightforward agreement or disagreement.

Therefore, based on the provided instructions for output format:
- **(query entails B3)**

Given the nuanced nature of the query in relation to the root node's focus, there isn't a clear-cut agreement or disagreement with **R1** that directly applies without considering the broader implications of a minor's legal capacity as outlined in Article 6.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article concludes that "A partner's creditor may not exercise the rights of that creditor against the partnership property." This can be phrased as:
- **R1**: A partner's creditor cannot exercise their rights against partnership property.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
To validate or invalidate R1, we need to consider key legal factors:
- **A1**: The principle of separate entity for partnerships and individual partners.
- **A2**: The rights and limitations of creditors in relation to partnership assets.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific base-level factors:
- Under **A1**:
  - **B1**: Partnerships are considered separate legal entities from their individual partners.
  - **B2**: Partnership assets are distinct from personal assets of the partners.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: Creditors of an individual partner have limited rights against partnership property.
  - **B4**: Specific laws or agreements may restrict creditor access to partnership assets.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor and base-level factor must be linked:
- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A1**
- **B3 supports A2**
- **B4 supports A2**
- **A1 supports R1** because recognizing partnerships as separate entities limits creditor access to partnership property.
- **A2 supports R1** by outlining the specific rights and limitations of creditors against partnership assets.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
The structure meets all criteria:
- **Existence of a Root Node (R)**: R1 is defined.
- **Single Directed Linkage**: Each factor links to only one other factor.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships**: All nodes, their context, and directed links are clearly defined.
- **Node Naming Convention**: Follows the required format.
- **Link Representation Format**: Uses "supports" and could use "denies" if applicable.

### Query Analysis
The query states: "An obligor of a partnership may set off his/her obligation against his/her claim against the partners."
This scenario involves an individual's obligations to a partnership and their claims against the partners, suggesting a consideration of how debts and credits are handled between individuals and partnerships.

Given this, we can say:
- **(query entails B3)** because it deals with the rights and limitations (specifically, set-off rights) of creditors or obligors in relation to partnership assets or partner's personal assets.

### Agreement with Root Node
Considering R1 and the query's scenario:
- The root node discusses a creditor's inability to exercise their rights against partnership property.
- The query implies a situation where an individual might have claims against partners personally but also obligations to the partnership, suggesting a potential for set-off or adjusting debts between personal and partnership levels.

Given these considerations:
- **(query disagree R1)** because the query suggests a possibility of offsetting obligations against claims, which involves exercising rights related to partnership assets (in the context of obligations to the partnership), contrary to the principle that creditors cannot exercise their rights directly against partnership property as stated in R1. However, upon reevaluation:
- This initial conclusion might be too hasty without considering the specific legal context and distinctions between set-off mechanisms and direct creditor actions against partnership assets.

### Rejustification
Upon closer examination and rejustification, recognizing that set-off mechanisms can indeed involve adjusting debts between parties but do not necessarily equate to a creditor directly exercising rights against partnership property:
- **(query agree R1)** might be more appropriate if we strictly interpret the query as involving obligations and claims that are managed within the framework of partnership law without directly violating the principle that creditors cannot exercise their rights against partnership assets. The set-off in question pertains to an obligor's relationship with the partners, not a direct creditor action against partnership property.

However, this conclusion depends heavily on the interpretation of "set off his/her obligation against his/her claim against the partners" and whether it implies actions that could be seen as indirectly exercising rights against partnership assets or merely settling accounts between individuals and partnerships in a manner consistent with R1. 

Therefore, the correct relationship might indeed lean towards agreement under strict interpretations but requires careful consideration of legal nuances and specific contexts not fully detailed in the query or article provided.

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and apply it to the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node represents the outcome or verdict the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 697, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A manager must manage another's business in a way that best suits the interests of the principal and may not demand payment for expenses incurred without obligation unless it aligns with the principal's known intentions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
These are key legal factors that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From Article 697, we can derive:
- **A1**: The manager's knowledge of the principal's intentions.
- **A2**: The manager's actions being in the best interest of the principal.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors, we get:
- **B1**: The manager knows the principal's intention to prevent crime at their house.
- **B2**: The repair of the hedge benefits both the manager's and the principal's houses for crime prevention.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- (**B1 supports A1**): Knowing the principal's intention supports the abstract factor of being aware of the principal's intentions.
- (**B2 supports A2**): Repairing the hedge for mutual benefit supports acting in the best interest of the principal.
- (**A1 supports R1**): Knowing the principal's intention supports the root node that a manager must act according to the principal's interests and may not demand payment unless aligned with those intentions.
- (**A2 supports R1**): Acting in the best interest of the principal supports the root node regarding benevolent intervention.

Given the query: B has repaired the hedge by himself for crime prevention of not only A's house but also B's house, B may not demand the payment of the expenses for the repair from A.

- (**Query entails B2**): The scenario involves repairing the hedge for mutual crime prevention benefit.
- (**Query agrees R1**): The query concludes that B may not demand payment, aligning with the principle that a manager (in this context, someone managing another's business without obligation) should act in the best interest of the principal and not seek compensation unless it aligns with the principal's known intentions.

Justification:
The query entails **B2** because both involve scenarios where an action (repairing the hedge) is taken for mutual benefit, specifically crime prevention. This aligns with the concept of acting in the best interest of the principal (**A2**), which supports the root node **R1**. The query agrees with **R1** because it concludes that B cannot demand payment for the repair expenses from A, reflecting the principle that one should not seek compensation for actions taken without obligation unless they align with the principal's intentions.

Re-justification:
Upon re-examination, considering the specifics of Article 697 and the query, the conclusion stands. The scenario presented in the query directly relates to the principles outlined in the article, particularly concerning benevolent intervention in another's business and the conditions under which expenses may be compensated. Thus, the initial assessment that (**query entails B2**) and (**query agrees R1**) remains accurate upon further review.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break it down step by step according to the provided instructions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that acquisitions of, losses of, and changes in real rights on immovables may not be duly asserted against any third parties unless registered. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: Acquisitions or changes in real rights on immovables cannot be asserted against third parties without registration.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The requirement for registration to assert acquisitions or changes against third parties.
- **A2**: The existence of exceptions or specific conditions under which registration may not be necessary to assert such rights.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A2** into more specific base-level factors, we get:
- **B1**: Co-ownership scenarios where one co-owner's share is inherited or transferred without registration.
- **B2**: Specific laws or regulations that exempt certain types of immovable property transactions from registration requirements.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **A1 supports R1** because the requirement for registration directly underpins the conclusion that unregistered acquisitions cannot be asserted against third parties.
- **A2 denies R1** since exceptions to the registration requirement could allow for assertion of rights without registration.
- **B1 supports A2** as it represents a scenario where registration might not be necessary due to the nature of co-ownership and inheritance.
- **B2 supports A2** because exemptions from registration would directly undermine the necessity of registration to assert rights.

### Applying the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the query about D inheriting A's share in a co-owned land and asserting this acquisition against B and C without registration, we analyze:

- The query involves a co-ownership scenario with inheritance, which aligns with **B1**.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.

### Justification of Agreement or Disagreement with the Root
The root node **R1** states that acquisitions cannot be asserted against third parties without registration. However, the query's scenario involves D asserting their inherited share against co-owners B and C without mentioning registration. This situation seems to disagree with **R1** because it implies a potential exception or specific condition (co-ownership and inheritance) where registration might not be necessary to assert rights among co-owners.

Thus, **(query disagrees R1)**.

Upon re-justification, considering the context of co-ownership and the specifics of inheritance, the initial analysis holds. The query does indeed entail a base-level factor related to co-ownership scenarios (**B1**), and it appears to disagree with the root node's blanket statement regarding the necessity of registration to assert rights against third parties.

Final Output:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagrees R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 714 seeks to establish that a person with the statutory obligation to supervise a person without capacity to assume responsibility is liable to compensate for damage inflicted by the latter on a third party, under certain conditions.

- **Root Node (R1):** A person with the statutory obligation to supervise is liable for damages caused by a person without capacity to assume responsibility.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The existence of a statutory obligation to supervise.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The failure to perform the supervision obligation.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The possibility of avoiding damage through proper supervision.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1:** The person has a legal duty to supervise the individual without capacity.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) under A2:** There was a breach of this supervision obligation.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3) under A3:** Proper supervision could have prevented the damage.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1):** Having a legal duty to supervise directly supports the existence of a statutory obligation.
- **(B2 supports A2):** A breach in supervision supports the factor of failure to perform the obligation.
- **(B3 supports A3):** The possibility of preventing damage through proper supervision supports the principle that damage could have been avoided.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Following the criteria:
- Each abstract factor and base-level factor has a directed link, adhering to the single linkage rule.
- The representation clearly defines nodes, their context, and relationships.

Given the query: "If a plaintiff files against a person with the legal obligation to supervise a person without capacity to assume liability as a defendant, and demands compensation of damages based on the liability of the person with the obligation to supervise a person without capacity to assume liability in Civil Code Article 714, Paragraph 1, the defendant may assert that an agent supervisor was there in addition to the person with the obligation to supervise as an affirmative defense."

Justification:
- **(query entails B2):** The query implies a situation where the defendant might argue they did not fail in their supervision duty because another (an agent supervisor) was also supervising, which relates to whether there was a breach of the supervision obligation.
  
Considering the root node and its agreement with the query's scenario:
- **(query agree R1):** The query essentially aligns with the conditions under which the person with the statutory obligation to supervise is liable. It discusses a situation where liability is being claimed based on the supervisory obligation, thus agreeing with the root verdict in comparable situations.

After rejustification, the conclusion remains that the query entails a consideration of whether there was a failure in supervision (related to B2) and agrees with the principle that a person with a statutory obligation to supervise can be liable for damages under certain conditions, as stated in R1. 

Therefore:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break down the information provided and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article discusses the duration of superficies and the conditions under which a superficiary may waive their rights. The root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A superficiary may waive their right at any time if the duration of superficies is not fixed, provided that if rent must be paid, notice or payment conditions are met.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **A1**: The absence of a fixed duration for the superficies.
- **A2**: The existence of relevant customs that could influence the duration.
- **A3**: The requirement to pay rent and the associated notice or payment conditions.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The superficies duration is explicitly stated as not fixed by the act that established it.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: There are no relevant customs that dictate the duration of superficies.
- Under **A3**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B3**: The requirement to give notice one year or more in advance if rent must be paid.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links include:
- (**B1** supports **A1**): The explicit statement of no fixed duration supports the abstract factor of absence of a fixed duration.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): The absence of relevant customs supports the abstract factor regarding customs.
- (**B3** supports **A3**): The notice or payment requirement for rent supports the abstract factor concerning rent conditions.
- (**A1** supports **R1**), (**A2** supports **R1**), and (**A3** denies **R1** under certain conditions): These links show how the abstract factors relate to the root node.

### Query Analysis
The query states: "The duration of agreed superficies must be fixed within a duration of 20 years or more but not more than 50 years."

### Justification of Base-Level Factors and Agreement with Root Node
- The query does **not directly match** any of the base-level factors (B1, B2, B3) as it discusses a specific duration range rather than the absence of a fixed duration, customs, or rent payment conditions.
- However, considering the context, the query **implies a scenario** where the duration is fixed within certain limits, which could be seen as related to but not directly matching **B1**, since B1 is about the absence of a fixed duration. Therefore, it might be tempting to say (query entails B1), but this would be incorrect because B1 specifically refers to the absence of a fixed duration, whereas the query talks about a specific range for the duration.
- The query and **R1 disagree** in the comparable situation because R1 discusses waiving rights when the duration is not fixed (with conditions), while the query proposes that the duration must be fixed within certain years. Thus, (query disagree R1).

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, it's clear that the initial interpretation was mostly correct but required clarification:
- The query indeed does not directly entail any base-level factor because it discusses a specific scenario (duration between 20 to 50 years) not explicitly covered by B1, B2, or B3.
- The disagreement with R1 is based on the understanding that R1 addresses situations where the duration is not fixed, whereas the query posits a requirement for a fixed duration within certain limits.

Therefore, the final assessment remains:
- (query disagree R1).

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if it is assumed a possessor does not have the intention to own due to the nature of the title, the nature of the possession does not change unless the possessor manifests an intention to own or commences possession under a new title with an intention to own. Thus, the Root Node (R1) can be determined as:
- **R1**: The nature of a possessor's possession changes if they manifest an intention to own or commence possession under a new title.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: Manifestation of the intention to own by the possessor.
- **A2**: Commencement of possession under a new title with an intention to own.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors, we have:
- Under **A1**:
  - **B1**: The possessor explicitly expresses their intention to own to the person who put the thing under their possession.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B2**: The possessor starts a new possession with an explicit intention to own from that time.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Explicit expression of ownership intention supports the factor of manifestation of intention to own.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Starting a new possession with an intention to own supports the commencement under a new title.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Manifestation of intention to own supports the change in the nature of possession.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Commencement of possession under a new title with an intention to own also supports the change in the nature of possession.

Given the query "In cases where it is assumed, due to the nature of the title, that a possessor does not have the intention to own, if the possessor commences possession under a new title with an intention to own from that time, the nature of the possessor's possession changes with the intention to own," we can see that:
- **(query entails B2)** because both consider the scenario where a possessor starts a new possession with an explicit intention to own.
  
Considering the root node and the query, since the query essentially describes a situation (commencing possession under a new title with an intention to own) that leads to a change in the nature of possession, which aligns with **R1**, we can conclude:
- **(query agree R1)**.

Justifying this further, both the query and **R1** acknowledge that a change in the possessor's intention (either by manifesting an intention to own or commencing possession under a new title) leads to a change in the nature of their possession. Thus, they fundamentally agree on the conditions under which the nature of possession changes.

Therefore, after careful consideration and re-justification:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this framework, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 675 seeks to establish that a creditor of a partnership may exercise their rights against the partnership property or against each partner in certain proportions.

- **Root Node (R1):** A creditor of a partnership can exercise rights against the partnership or individual partners based on specific conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors include:
- The option for creditors to choose how they exercise their rights.
- Knowledge of partner's share proportions at the time of claim occurrence.
- The proportionality of loss among partners as a basis for exercising creditor rights.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Creditor's choice in exercising rights against the partnership or individual partners.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Proportion of each partner's share of loss at the time of claim occurrence.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2, we have:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** If a creditor knew the proportion of each partner's share of loss, they must exercise rights based on those proportions.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** In absence of knowledge about specific proportions at claim occurrence, creditors can choose equal proportions.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1):** The creditor's choice supports the root determination by providing flexibility in how rights are exercised.
- **(A2 supports R1):** Knowing the proportion of each partner's share of loss supports the exercise of rights against individual partners based on those proportions.
- **(B1 supports A2):** If a creditor knew the proportions, exercising rights accordingly supports the principle of proportional liability.
- **(B2 supports A2):** Choosing equal proportions when specific knowledge is lacking also supports the principle by offering an alternative method.

### Query Analysis
Given query: "A creditor of a partnership may, at the choice of the creditor, exercise the rights of the creditor against each partner in equal proportions, even if a creditor of a partnership knew the proportion of each partner's share of loss at the time of occurrence of the claim."

- **(query entails B2):** The query considers exercising rights in equal proportions, which aligns with B2.
- However, upon closer examination, the query seems to misinterpret the conditions under which equal proportions can be chosen. According to Article 675(2), if a creditor knew the proportion of each partner's share of loss at the time of claim occurrence, they must exercise their rights based on those proportions, not in equal proportions.

### Justification
Initially, it appears that **(query entails B2)** because both consider exercising rights against partners in equal proportions. However, upon reevaluation:
- The query actually **disagrees** with the nuances presented in Article 675, particularly regarding the condition that knowledge of specific proportions at claim occurrence should lead to exercising rights based on those proportions.
- Therefore, considering the most comparable scenario and upon careful reconsideration, **(query disagree R1)** because it misinterprets the conditions under which a creditor can choose equal proportions.

**Output:**
- (query entails B2)
- Upon reevaluation and correction: 
- The accurate interpretation should reflect that while the query touches on concepts related to B2, its misunderstanding of the application based on known proportions leads to disagreement with R1.
- Hence, the corrected justification emphasizes **(query disagree R1)** due to misinterpretation of conditions for exercising rights in equal proportions when specific knowledge about partner's share is available.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 620 is that if a lease is cancelled, the cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future and does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: Cancellation of a contract (such as a lease) affects its future effectiveness but allows for claims of past losses.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The nature of the cancellation and its implications on contractual obligations.
- **A2**: The principle of compensation for loss or damage despite contract cancellation.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1, we have:
- **B1**: The cancellation of a partnership contract solely affects future operations.
- **B2**: Past actions under the contract can still incur liabilities.

For A2, refinement yields:
- **B3**: Claims for compensation due to loss or damage are valid post-cancellation.
- **B4**: Contractual obligations prior to cancellation remain enforceable.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- (**B1 supports A1**): The specific scenario of partnership contract cancellation supports the general principle of how cancellations affect future contractual obligations.
- (**B2 supports A1**): Past actions incurring liabilities also support the understanding of how cancellations impact contractual obligations over time.
- (**B3 supports A2**): Valid claims for compensation post-cancellation directly support the principle that cancellation does not negate all financial responsibilities.
- (**B4 supports A2**): Enforceable past obligations further reinforce the notion that cancellation has limitations on negating liabilities.

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root

Given the query "The cancellation of a partnership contract shall solely become effective toward the future," we can analyze its relationship to our constructed ANGELIC structure:

- **(Query entails B1)**: The query directly pertains to the scenario described by Base-Level Factor B1, which addresses how the cancellation of a specific type of contract (partnership) affects its future operations.
  
To assess agreement or disagreement with the root node R1:
- The root node R1 discusses the general principle that cancellation affects future effectiveness but allows for past loss claims. 
- The query specifically addresses partnership contracts becoming effective toward the future upon cancellation, which is a scenario covered under the broader principle outlined in R1.

Thus, considering the evidence and scenarios presented:
- **(Query agree R1)**: The query's assertion about partnership contract cancellations aligns with the root node's principle that cancellations impact future effectiveness without precluding claims for past losses or damages.

After rejustification, this analysis holds consistent, affirming the initial conclusions regarding the relationship between the query and the ANGELIC structure components. 

Output:
- (Query entails B1)
- (Query agree R1)

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provision, we'll follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The article seeks to establish that if there is a default with respect to a claim secured by a mortgage, the mortgage extends to the fruits of the mortgaged immovables derived after the default.
   - Therefore, the root node (R1) can be stated as: "A mortgage extends to the fruits of the mortgaged immovables if there is a default."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
     - A1: Existence of a mortgage securing a claim.
     - A2: Occurrence of a default with respect to the secured claim.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors, we get:
     - B1: The mortgage is legally valid and properly registered.
     - B2: The default is clearly defined and communicated to the parties involved.
     - B3: The fruits of the mortgaged immovables are identifiable and can be legally claimed.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - Each abstract factor supports the root node:
     - (A1 supports R1)
     - (A2 supports R1)
   - Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor:
     - (B1 supports A1)
     - (B2 supports A2)
     - (B3 supports A1, as it pertains to the identification and claim of fruits)

Given the query: "If there is a default with respect to a claim secured by a mortgage, the mortgage shall extend to the fruits of the Mortgaged Immovable Properties derived after the default."

- **Justification whether the query entails base-level factors:** The query considers a scenario where a default has occurred and implies that the mortgage should extend to the fruits of the mortgaged immovables. This scenario aligns with the conditions outlined in B2 (default is clearly defined and communicated) and implicitly requires B3 (fruits are identifiable and can be claimed). Thus, we can say: **(query entails B2)** and **(query entails B3)**.
- **Justification whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root:** The query directly aligns with the conclusion of R1, which states that upon default, a mortgage extends to the fruits of the mortgaged immovables. Therefore, we can conclude: **(query agree R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of the legal provision and the query's alignment with the base-level factors and the root node, it's clear that the initial analysis accurately reflects the relationship between the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure. 

Thus, the final output is:
- **(query entails B2)**

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 675 seeks to establish that a creditor of a partnership may exercise their rights against either the partnership property or each partner, under certain conditions.
   - Thus, the Root Node (R1) is: "A creditor of a partnership may exercise their rights against each partner or the partnership property."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
     - A1: The existence of partnership property against which the creditor can exercise their rights.
     - A2: The option for the creditor to choose whether to pursue each partner individually, based on their shares of loss or in equal proportions.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, a base-level factor could be:
     - B1: The partnership has assets that can be used to satisfy the creditor's claim.
   - For A2, base-level factors could include:
     - B2: The creditor is unaware of the proportion of each partner's share of loss at the time of the occurrence of the claim, allowing for the choice of equal proportions.
     - B3: The creditor knew the proportion of each partner's share of loss, necessitating the exercise of rights based on those proportions.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - (B1 supports A1)
   - (B2 supports A2)
   - (B3 supports A2)
   - (A1 supports R1)
   - (A2 supports R1)

Given the query: "The creditor of a partnership may not exercise his/her rights against each partner."

- **Justification whether the query entails base-level factors:** The query does not directly align with any specific base-level factor as it presents a blanket statement contrary to the provisions. However, its essence is closest to contradicting the conditions under which a creditor can exercise their rights against partners (related to A2 and by extension B2 and B3). But since none of the base-level factors directly state that a creditor "may not" exercise their rights, we say: (query does not entail B1), (query does not entail B2), (query does not entail B3).

- **Justification whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root:** The query fundamentally disagrees with R1 because it negates the possibility of a creditor exercising their rights against each partner, which is directly allowed by Article 675 under certain conditions. Thus: (query disagree R1).

After careful reconsideration, this analysis holds true as the query's statement contradicts the foundational principle established by Article 675 regarding creditors' rights against partners in a partnership.

The article seeks to establish that a pledgee may subpledge the thing pledged within the duration of the pledgee's right, upon the pledgee's own responsibility. Thus, the root node can be defined as:

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The pledgee's responsibility in case of loss.
- **A2**: The duration of the pledgee's right.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
- **B1**: The pledgee is responsible for any loss arising from the subpledge, even if caused by force majeure.
For **A2**:
- **B2**: The subpledge must occur within the duration of the original pledge.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1 supports A1**): Because being responsible for any loss directly relates to the pledgee's responsibility.
- (**B2 supports A2**): Since the duration is a condition for the subpledge, it supports the factor of the pledgee's right duration.
- (**A1 supports R1**): The pledgee's responsibility underlines their right to subpledge.
- (**A2 supports R1**): The duration within which the pledgee can act is crucial for their right to subpledge.

Given the query: "A pledgee may not further create a pledge with respect to the subject matter of the pledge as collateral for his debt without the consent of the pledgor."

### Justification
The query essentially discusses a condition (need for the pledgor's consent) that isn't directly addressed by **R1** or its supporting factors. However, it can be seen as related to **B2**, because both deal with conditions under which a pledgee can subpledge, though from different angles.

- (**query entails B2**): Because both consider specific scenarios or conditions under which the pledgee's actions are valid (though the query introduces an additional condition not explicitly mentioned in **R1** or its direct factors).

Considering the root node **R1**, the query seems to introduce a restriction ("without the consent of the pledgor") that isn't directly part of **R1**. Thus, it can be seen as introducing a new factor or modifying the conditions under which **R1** applies.

- (**query disagree R1**): Because **R1** suggests a pledgee has the right to subpledge based on their responsibility and within the duration of their right, without explicitly mentioning the need for the pledgor's consent. The query introduces this as a necessary condition, potentially limiting or modifying the scope of **R1**.

After re-justification:
The conclusion remains that the query introduces a new condition (need for consent) not directly addressed by the original article or its factors. This condition could be seen as refining or adding to the scenarios under which **B2** and consequently **A2** and **R1** apply, but it does indeed seem to introduce a disagreement with how **R1** is presented without such conditions.

Thus, the final assessment is:
- (**query entails B2**)
- (**query disagree R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 139 is to establish that when a period is provided for in hours, the period commences immediately at the specified time. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1:** The commencement of a time period specified in hours begins immediately.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The specification of the start time.
- **A2:** The nature of the period (in hours).

These abstract factors validate the conclusion by providing the necessary conditions for when and how the period commences.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, we can refine it into base-level factors as follows:
- **B1:** The agreement specifies a clear start time.
- **B2:** The start time is not during a Sunday, holiday as provided in the Act on National Holidays, or any other holiday.

For **A2**:
- **B3:** The period is indeed specified in hours.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**

And each abstract factor supports the root node:
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
The structure adheres to the criteria by having a clear root node, single directed linkages, and representation of context and relationships.

### Justification
Given the query: "If an agreement is made at 10:00 a.m. on June 3 of a given year that the obligation will be fulfilled within five hours, the period commences at 10:00 a.m. of the same day, which does not fall on Sunday, holiday as provided in the Act on National Holidays, or any other holiday."

- **(query entails B1)** because both consider a clear start time for the agreement.
- **(query entails B2)** since the query specifies that the day is not a Sunday, holiday, etc., aligning with B2's conditions.
- **(query entails B3)** as the period in question (five hours) is specified in hours.

Considering these base-level factors are entailed by the query and support their respective abstract factors (**A1** and **A2**), which in turn support the root node **R1**, it indicates that the query aligns with the legal conclusion presented by Article 139. Therefore:
- **(query agree R1)**, as both the query and the root node conclude that the period commences immediately at the specified time under similar conditions.

Upon rejustification, considering the specific details of the query (start time, nature of the day, specification in hours) align perfectly with the base-level factors derived from the article's provisions, it reinforces the conclusion that:
- **(query agree R1)**. The query and the root node **R1** are in agreement regarding the commencement of the period under the described conditions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node is determined by identifying the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. In this case, the root node (R1) can be defined as: "A statutory superficies is created with respect to a building when the land and the building belong to different owners due to the enforcement of a mortgage initially created for both."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key abstract factors that substantiate or undermine this legal conclusion include:
- A1: The initial ownership of both the land and the building by the same person.
- A2: The creation of a joint mortgage with respect to both the land and the building.
- A3: The enforcement of the mortgage resulting in different owners for the land and the building.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- B1 (supports A1): The original owner (person A) initially owns both the land and the building.
- B2 (supports A2): A mortgage is created that jointly covers both the land and the building for person B.
- B3 (supports A3): The execution of the mortgage results in the land being owned by a different person (person C), while the ownership of the building remains with or is transferred to another party.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1
- A3 supports R1

Given the query: "In cases where a building owned by person A is built on land owned by person A, and then after a mortgage is created as a joint mortgage for person B with respect to the building and the land, the result of the execution of the mortgage with respect to the land only is that person C became the land owner, then statutory superficies with respect to the building on the land will be established."

Justification:
- The query entails B1 because it mentions a scenario where the building is owned by person A and built on land also owned by person A.
- The query entails B2 as it talks about creating a joint mortgage for person B regarding both the building and the land.
- The query entails B3 since it describes the execution of the mortgage leading to person C becoming the owner of the land, implying different ownership for the land and potentially the building.

Considering these base-level factors are entailed by the query and directly support their respective abstract factors (A1, A2, A3), which in turn support the root node R1, it indicates that the scenario described in the query aligns with the conditions under which a statutory superficies would be created according to the article.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

After re-justification, considering the step-by-step analysis and how each factor aligns with the conditions described in both the legal provision and the query, it's clear that the creation of a statutory superficies as described is indeed supported by the scenario presented in the query. Thus, the agreement between the query and the root node (R1) regarding the establishment of a statutory superficies under the given conditions remains consistent upon further review.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 608(2) in relation to the right of retention by a lessee after the termination of the lease can be summarized as:
- **R1**: The right of retention by a lessee for reimbursement of beneficial expenses after lease termination is extinguished if the court grants a period of time for reimbursement at the lessor's request.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The legal basis for a lessee's right of retention.
- **A2**: The conditions under which a court may grant a period of time for reimbursement.
- **A3**: The impact of lease termination on the lessee's rights.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining these abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The possession of the leased property by the lessee as a basis for retention.
  - **B2**: The existence of beneficial expenses incurred by the lessee.
- Under **A2**, we have:
  - **B3**: The lessor's request for a period of time to reimburse the expenses.
  - **B4**: The court's discretion in granting such requests based on reasonableness.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Directed links between factors:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Possession is crucial for the right of retention.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: Beneficial expenses justify the retention.
- **(B3 supports A2)**: The lessor's request is a prerequisite for court consideration.
- **(B4 supports A2)**: Reasonableness is key in the court's decision to grant time.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The basis of the right of retention affects its extinguishment.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: Granting time can negate the need for retention.

### Evaluation Against Query

Given query: "In cases where a lessee of a building has exercised a right of retention to secure reimbursement of the beneficial expenses after the termination of the lease, the right of retention will be extinguished if the court grants a period of time for the reimbursement at the request of the lessor."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query considers a scenario where the lessee is in possession and has incurred beneficial expenses.
- **(query entails B2)**: Beneficial expenses are mentioned as the reason for retention.
- **(query entails B3)**: The scenario includes the lessor's request for time to reimburse.
- **(query agrees R1)**: The query states that the right of retention is extinguished if the court grants a period for reimbursement, aligning with the root node.

After careful consideration and reevaluation:
The initial assessment stands as it directly applies the provided legal provisions to the scenario described in the query. The presence of beneficial expenses (B2), the lessor's request for time (B3), and the impact on the right of retention all support the conclusion that the right is extinguished upon the court granting a reimbursement period, aligning with R1.

Thus, the final output remains:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query entails B3)**
- **(query agrees R1)**

 To address the problem, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the articles provided seeks to establish conditions under which a manifestation of intention can be considered voidable due to mistakes or fraud. Thus, the root node (R) can be determined as:
- **R1**: A manifestation of intention is voidable if it is based on a mistake or induced by fraud.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The presence of a material mistake in the manifestation of intention.
- **A2**: The influence of fraud or duress on the manifestation of intention.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1**:
  - **B1**: A mistake regarding the person's intention that corresponds to the manifestation.
  - **B2**: A mistake about circumstances taken as the basis for the juridical act.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: The manifestation of intention being induced by fraud.
  - **B4**: The manifestation of intention being under duress.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
The directed links are established as follows:
- (**B1 supports A1**): Mistake regarding intention supports the condition for voidability due to mistake.
- (**B2 supports A1**): Mistake about circumstances supports the condition for voidability due to mistake.
- (**A1 supports R1**): Presence of a material mistake supports the conclusion that a manifestation of intention is voidable.
- (**B3 supports A2**): Fraud inducing the manifestation supports the condition for voidability due to fraud or duress.
- (**B4 supports A2**): Duress causing the manifestation supports the condition for voidability due to fraud or duress.
- (**A2 supports R1**): Influence of fraud or duress supports the conclusion that a manifestation of intention is voidable.

### Justification
Given the query: "If there is a mistake in any element of the juristic act which is induced by any fraud and manifestation of intention is induced by the mistake, the person who made the manifestation of intention may assert such nullity of the manifestation of intention by mistake."

- (**query entails B2**): The query mentions a mistake about circumstances (an element of the juristic act) being induced by fraud, which aligns with **B2**, a specific type of mistake.
- (**query agree R1**): The scenario described in the query—where a manifestation of intention is based on a mistake induced by fraud—supports the conclusion that such a manifestation can be considered voidable, as stated by **R1**.

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances of the query and the legal framework provided:
- The query indeed involves a situation where a mistake (about an element of the juristic act) is induced by fraud, which directly relates to the conditions under which a manifestation of intention can be considered voidable.
- Thus, the initial assessment that (**query entails B2**) and (**query agree R1**) holds true upon further consideration. 

Therefore, the output based on the provided format is:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. In this case, the article establishes that a mortgagee has the right to have their claim satisfied prior to other obligees out of immovables provided as security without transferring possession.

- **Root Node (R1):** A mortgagee's claim is satisfied before other claims from specified immovable assets.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the root legal conclusion include:
- The existence of a mortgage agreement.
- The type of property mortgaged (in this case, immovables).
- The priority of claims against the mortgaged property.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Existence and validity of a mortgage agreement securing an obligation.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Nature and classification of assets provided as security (immovables).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- For A1, a base-level factor could be the specific condition that the mortgage is created to secure a claim that may arise in the future and is registered.
- For A2, since superficies and farming rights can also be mortgaged according to the provisions, this does not necessarily require further refinement for our query.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The mortgage secures a future claim and is properly registered.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The property mortgaged includes superficies or farming rights (though less directly relevant to our specific query).

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor supports the root node:
- (A1 supports R1) because having a valid mortgage agreement is crucial for the mortgagee's claim.
- (A2 supports R1) since specifying that immovables can be mortgaged supports the satisfaction of claims from these assets.

Base-level factors support their respective abstract factors:
- (B1 supports A1) as registering a mortgage for future claims is part of having a valid agreement.
- (B2 supports A2), though less directly relevant to our query about future claims, it's still a type of asset that can be mortgaged.

### Evaluating the Query
The query asks if a mortgage created to secure a claim that may arise in the future and is registered will effectively secure the claim when it arises. 

- **(query entails B1)** because the scenario described in the query matches the conditions outlined in Base-Level Factor B1, involving a mortgage for future claims and its registration.
  
Given this structure, we see that B1 supports A1, which in turn supports R1. Therefore, the query aligns with the root node's conclusion about the priority of satisfying the mortgagee's claim from specified assets.

- **(query agree R1)** because both the query and the root node R1 are concerned with the effective securing of claims through a properly established and registered mortgage agreement on immovable assets, ensuring the mortgagee's priority in satisfaction of their claim. 

After careful consideration and reevaluation, this analysis holds consistent with the provided legal framework and the specifics of the query presented.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, let's first break down the information provided and apply it to the ANGELIC structure formation criteria.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article discusses how possessory rights are acquired. The root node can be determined as:
- R1: Possessory rights are acquired by possessing a thing with the intention to do so on one's own behalf.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion regarding possessory rights include:
- A1: Intention to possess on one's own behalf.
- A2: Actual possession of the thing.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors, we get:
- B1 (under A1): The possessor must have a clear intention to possess the property as their own.
- B2 (under A2): The possession must be physical and not just theoretical or legal.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links between factors are established as follows:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Given the query: "A's minor child B who is living with A in building P owned by A shall not possess the possessory right of building P."

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement/Disagreement with Root Node

The query entails a consideration of whether living in a property owned by another (in this case, a parent) automatically grants possessory rights to the occupant (the minor child). This scenario is similar to what base-level factor B2 considers—actual possession.

- **Entailment**: The query does consider evidence in a similar situation or scenario regarding physical presence and ownership, which aligns with the concept of actual possession. Thus, (query entails B2).

Regarding agreement or disagreement with the root node R1:
- The root node states that possessory rights are acquired through intention to possess on one's own behalf. The query suggests that a minor child living in a building owned by their parent does not automatically acquire possessory rights of that building.
- **Agreement/Disagreement**: Since the query implies that mere physical presence (as in the case of the minor child) without explicit intention or legal ownership does not grant possessory rights, it aligns with the principle stated in R1. The root node emphasizes intention and actual possession as criteria for acquiring possessory rights. Thus, if we consider the scenario where a minor's presence is seen as lacking the necessary intention to claim possessory rights independently, then (query agree R1).

After reconsideration:
- The justification holds because the query essentially questions whether the conditions for possessing possessory rights (as outlined in R1 and supported by A1 and A2) are met in the scenario of a minor child living with their parent. Given that the minor's presence is conditional upon their parent's ownership and not necessarily an expression of their own intention to possess, it supports the root node's stipulation about the necessity of intentional possession for acquiring possessory rights.

Therefore:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break down the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 234 is that a building must be distanced at least 50 centimeters away from the boundary line to avoid potential legal actions from neighboring landowners. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: Construction within the 50-centimeter boundary without permission may lead to suspension or change of construction.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The distance between the building and the boundary line.
- **A2**: The timing and completion status of the construction project.
- **A3**: The rights of neighboring landowners to claim compensation or demand changes.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining these factors further, we get:
- Under **A1**, a specific base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: Construction in direct contact with the boundary line.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B2**: Construction started more than one year ago or has been completed.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B3**: The neighboring landowner's claim for compensation due to loss or damage.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Directed links are established as follows:
- **B1 supports A1**, indicating that direct contact with the boundary line violates the distance requirement.
- **B2 denies A2**, suggesting that if construction started over a year ago or is completed, suspension or change may not be possible, only compensation can be claimed.
- **B3 supports A3**, showing that neighboring landowners have rights to claim for damages.

Given the query: "Even in cases where a building must be constructed 50 centimeters or more distant away from the boundary line, the owner of the neighboring land may not have construction suspended or changed when a person attempts to construct a building in contact with the boundary."

### Justification:
- The query **entails B1** because it specifically mentions constructing a building in contact with the boundary line, which aligns with the scenario described by **B1**.
- Considering **R1**, the root node, and comparing it with the query's implication: the query essentially discusses a situation where, despite the violation (constructing in contact), the neighboring landowner may not be able to have the construction suspended or changed. This seems to align more closely with scenarios described under specific conditions (like timing) rather than directly opposing **R1**'s general statement about potential legal actions for violations.
- Upon closer examination, the query actually suggests a condition under which **R1** might not apply as straightforwardly, particularly focusing on the inability to suspend or change construction in certain circumstances. Thus, it could be seen that the query does not directly disagree with **R1** but rather provides a nuanced view under specific conditions.

Therefore, after careful consideration:
- The query entails **B1**.
- Given the nuances and specific conditions mentioned in the query, it seems to provide additional context rather than directly disagreeing with **R1**, thus it could be seen as not directly disagreeing but also not fully agreeing due to the specificity of its scenario.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- Upon further reflection, given that the query provides a nuanced view under specific conditions and does not broadly disagree with **R1**'s premise regarding violations and potential actions, it might be more accurate to consider its agreement in the context provided. However, my analysis initially leaned towards a direct comparison without fully acknowledging the nuanced nature of legal interpretations. Thus, considering standard formats for such outputs:
- (query entails B1)
- Given the complexity of directly applying "agree" or "disagree" without overstepping into legal interpretation nuances not explicitly covered by the initial instructions, and focusing strictly on format compliance: 
The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B1)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the article is to establish that a guarantor must perform their guarantee obligations when the obligee demands to do so, even if the principal obligor has a claim against the obligee. Thus, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1:** A guarantor must fulfill their obligations upon demand by the obligee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The postponement of expiry and renewal of prescription periods affecting both principal obligor and guarantor.
- **A2:** The ability of a guarantor to assert defenses on behalf of the principal obligor.
- **A3:** The rights of set-off, rescind, or cancel that might affect the obligation.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1:**
- **B1:** Postponement of expiry due to a request for performance affects both principal obligor and guarantor.
- **B2:** Renewal of prescription period due to similar grounds impacts the guarantor's obligations.

For **A2:**
- **B3:** A guarantor can assert a defense that the principal obligor could have raised against the obligee.

For **A3:**
- **B4:** The existence of a right to set-off that could release the principal obligor from their obligation.
- **B5:** The presence of a right to rescind or cancel affecting the guarantor's performance obligation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**A1 supports R1**): Because if the prescription period is postponed or renewed, it does not inherently negate the guarantor's obligation upon demand.
- (**A2 supports R1**): As the ability to assert defenses does not necessarily release the guarantor from their obligations unless those defenses directly apply and are valid.
- (**A3 denies R1**): Because if the principal obligor has rights that could release them from the obligation, it might also impact the guarantor's obligation to perform.
  
At the base level:
- (**B1 supports A1**)
- (**B2 supports A1**)
- (**B3 supports A2**)
- (**B4 denies A3**), in the context that it could potentially release both principal and guarantor from obligations if applicable.
- (**B5 denies A3**), similar to B4, under specific conditions.

### Query Justification
Given the query: "Even if the principal obligor has a claim vis-a-vis the obligee, the guarantor must perform his/her guarantee obligations when the obligee demands to do so."

- **(Query entails B1)** because both consider scenarios where obligations are demanded despite potential claims.
- **(Query entails B3)** as it involves asserting defenses on behalf of the principal obligor, which is part of the query's context.
- **(Query disagree R1)** upon initial consideration because the query suggests that having a claim (which could be related to set-off, rescind, or cancel rights) might affect the guarantor's obligation. However, this disagreement hinges on interpreting "claim" in the broadest sense, including those that directly negate the principal obligor's debt.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation:
- The query actually **(agrees R1)** because it fundamentally asserts that despite potential claims between the principal obligor and the obligee, the guarantor is still obligated to perform when demanded. This aligns with **R1**'s conclusion that a guarantor must fulfill their obligations upon demand by the obligee, regardless of the principal obligor's situation.

Thus, the corrected justification is:
- (Query entails B1)
- (Query entails B3)
- (Query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break down the information provided and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome or legal conclusion we are seeking to establish or refute based on the articles provided is related to the effectiveness of sales contracts and the transfer of ownership. Given the context, a possible root node could be:
- R1: "B has the right to demand the transfer registration procedure from C to B for land P."

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The validity of the sales contracts (First Sales Contract between A and B, and Second Sales Contract between A and C).
- A2: The effect of registration on ownership transfer.
- A3: The intention of the parties as manifested in their agreements.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- B1 (supports A1): A sold land P to B before selling it to C, indicating a prior agreement.
- B2 (supports A1): Payment was received by A from B for the First Sales Contract.
- B3 (denies A1): The Second Sales Contract and its registration could potentially override the first if not properly accounted for.
- B4 (supports A2): Registration is crucial for the effective transfer of ownership according to legal principles.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A1)
- (B3 denies A1)
- (B4 supports A2)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)
- (A3 could either support or deny R1 depending on the context, but for simplicity, let's assume it supports R1 if the intentions were clear and legally binding)

### Justification of Query Entailment
Given the query:
- A concluded a sales contract with B and received payment but did not undertake ownership transfer registration.
- Then A sold the same land to C with registration.
- B is now seeking to have the land registered in their name.

The query entails base-level factors because it considers similar scenarios of sales contracts, payment, and registration issues. Specifically:
- (query entails B1) because both involve a prior sale agreement.
- (query entails B2) as payment was made in both scenarios.
- (query entails B3) since the second sale with registration could impact the first sale's validity.
- (query entails B4) because registration is crucial for effective ownership transfer in both cases.

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node
The query essentially agrees with R1 if we consider that B has a legitimate claim based on their prior agreement and payment, despite the lack of registration. The fact that A went missing and B is seeking registration against C suggests that B believes they have rights to the land, which aligns with the root node's conclusion about B's right to demand transfer registration from C to B.

Therefore:
- (query agrees R1)

After careful reconsideration, this analysis holds because the query presents a scenario where B has a prior claim and is seeking legal recognition of their ownership, which is in line with the principles outlined in the provided articles regarding sales contracts, ownership, and the importance of registration.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break it down step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 18 is about the rescission of the decision for commencement of assistance when the grounds cease to exist. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- R1: The family court must rescind the decision for commencement of assistance if the grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1) cease to exist.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- A1: Existence of a request from an eligible party (the person in question, their spouse, relative within the fourth degree of kinship, guardian of a minor, supervisor of a minor's guardian, assistant, assistant's supervisor, or a public prosecutor) to rescind the decision.
- A2: Cessation of grounds for commencement of assistance as prescribed.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors:
- B1: The request is made by an eligible party directly involved with the person in question (e.g., the person themselves, their spouse).
- B2: The request is made by a third-party entity or individual indirectly related to the person in question but still within the defined scope of eligibility (e.g., relative, guardian, public prosecutor).
- B3: The grounds for commencement of assistance as initially determined have ceased to exist.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- (B1 supports A1): Directly involved parties making a request support the abstract factor of an eligible request.
- (B2 supports A1): Indirectly related but eligible parties making a request also support the abstract factor of an eligible request.
- (B3 supports A2): The cessation of grounds directly supports the abstract factor concerning the end of initial conditions for assistance.
- (A1 supports R1): An eligible request supports the root node of rescinding the decision.
- (A2 supports R1): The cessation of grounds supports the root node, as it is a fundamental condition for the rescission.

### Justification
Given the query: "If the grounds of commencement of assistance cease to exist, the family court may rescind the decision for commencement of assistance without any party's request."
- This query considers a scenario where the cessation of grounds (similar to B3) directly influences the decision to rescind without necessarily requiring an explicit request from any party.
- Therefore, it seems to align with or consider evidence in a similar situation as base-level factor B3, which focuses on the cessation of initial grounds for assistance.

### Agreement/Disagreement with Root Node
The query suggests that the family court "may" rescind the decision without a request if the grounds cease to exist. The root node R1 states that the family court "must" rescind under similar conditions but upon receiving a request.
- The query and R1 agree on the condition of the cessation of grounds being crucial for the potential rescission of the assistance decision.
- However, they seem to disagree on whether an explicit request is necessary for the rescission when the grounds cease to exist. The root node implies a necessity for a request, whereas the query suggests this can happen without one.

### Final Justification
Upon reevaluation:
- The query indeed entails B3 because it discusses the cessation of grounds.
- However, considering the nuances in the interpretation of "may" and the specifics about requests, the query seems to disagree with R1 regarding the necessity of a request for rescinding the decision when the grounds cease to exist.

### Output
(query entails B3), (query disagree R1).

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 665 and related articles seeks to establish the principle that a depositary (or mandatary in the context of mandate) has certain rights regarding reimbursement for costs, obligations borne, and compensation for losses not due to their negligence.

**Root Node R1:** A depositary can demand performance of obligations or reimbursement from the depositor under specified conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
- **Abstract Factor A1:** The depositary has expended necessary costs.
- **Abstract Factor A2:** The depositary has borne obligations necessary for the administration of the deposited thing.
- **Abstract Factor A3:** The depositary incurs loss or damage not due to their negligence.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
- **Base-Level Factor B1 under A2:** If an obligation has not yet fallen due, the depositary can require the depositor to tender reasonable security.
- **Base-Level Factor B2 under A1:** The depositary may claim reimbursement of costs and interest from the day the costs were expended.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(B1 supports A2):** Requiring reasonable security for future obligations supports the concept that the depositary can demand performance of obligations.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The ability to demand obligation performance supports the root node's principle.
- **(A3 supports R1):** Compensation for non-negligent losses also supports the principle outlined in the root node.

### Query Analysis:
Given the query, "If borne obligations are deemed to be necessary for the retention of a deposited thing, the depositary can demand that the depositor perform the obligation on the depositary's behalf. In such cases, if the obligation has not yet fallen due, the depositary can require the depositor to tender reasonable security."

- **(query entails B1):** The query directly addresses a situation where the depositary requires reasonable security for future obligations, aligning with Base-Level Factor B1.
  
### Agreement with Root Node:
The query essentially outlines conditions under which a depositary's rights are protected regarding obligations and their performance by the depositor. This scenario agrees with the principle established in **Root Node R1** that a depositary can demand performance of obligations or reimbursement from the depositor under specified conditions.

- **(query agree R1):** The query supports the verdict presented in Root Node R1, as both involve scenarios where the depositary's rights regarding obligations are upheld.

Upon rejustification, considering the detailed breakdown and analysis:
- The query indeed entails Base-Level Factor B1 because it discusses requiring reasonable security for future obligations.
- The query agrees with Root Node R1 because it supports the principle that a depositary has the right to demand performance of obligations or reimbursement under specified conditions.

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

53 correct 25 wrongs 78 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node represents the outcome or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 504, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The person entitled to subrogation is relieved from responsibility to the extent that they can no longer seek reimbursement due to the loss or diminution in the security available upon subrogation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the root legal conclusion. From Article 504, we can derive:
- **A1**: The obligee causes the security to be lost or diminished intentionally or negligently.
- **A2**: The obligee has reasonable grounds in light of common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be lost or diminished.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
For **A1**, we can refine it into more specific conditions:
- **B1**: The loss or diminution of security is due to the obligee's intentional actions.
- **B2**: The loss or diminution of security is due to the obligee's negligence.

For **A2**, no further refinement is needed as it directly addresses a condition that affects the root node.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **B1 supports A1**: Intentional actions by the obligee support the factor of causing security loss or diminution.
- **B2 supports A1**: Negligence by the obligee also supports the factor of causing security loss or diminution.
- **A1 supports R1**: If the obligee causes the security to be lost or diminished, it supports the relief of responsibility from the person entitled to subrogation.
- **A2 denies R1**: Having reasonable grounds for causing the security to be lost or diminished denies the relief of responsibility from the person entitled to subrogation.

### Query Analysis:
Given the query: "In case that the obligee is found to have reasonable grounds in light of the common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be diminished, the guarantor may not assert that the guarantor is relieved from responsibility to the extent that the guarantor can no longer seek the reimbursement due to the diminution in the security available upon subrogation."

- The query entails **A2** because it discusses a scenario where the obligee has reasonable grounds for the security diminution, which directly relates to **A2**.
- Since **A2** denies **R1**, and the query essentially states that under certain conditions (reasonable grounds), the guarantor cannot claim relief from responsibility, it aligns with denying the root node's conclusion in those specific circumstances.

### Conclusion:
- (query entails B is not directly applicable as the query directly references A2).
- Given the context and the direct reference to **A2** in the query, we can say that the query essentially agrees with the conditions under which **R1** would be denied, based on the information provided. Therefore, the correct output format reflecting the analysis is:
  - (query agree R1) is not accurate because the query actually supports a condition under which R1 is denied.
  - The more precise interpretation, given our structure and the direct linkages established, should reflect that the query discusses conditions denying the root conclusion in specific scenarios.

Upon reevaluation for clarity and adherence to instructions:
- The query's alignment with **A2** indicates it's about a condition denying **R1**, suggesting an agreement with the denial of **R1** under those specific circumstances rather than agreeing with **R1** itself. Thus, a precise interpretation in the context provided should be focused on how the query interacts with the established factors and root node, considering the nuances of legal argumentation and the structure presented.

Given this nuanced understanding and the need to align with the specified output format while accurately reflecting the analysis:
- The correct reflection should consider whether the query supports or denies the conditions leading to **R1**, acknowledging that it specifically references a scenario denying relief (**A2**), which in turn denies **R1**. 

Therefore, considering the instructions and aiming for clarity:
- The query discusses a condition under which **R1** is denied, suggesting an alignment with the denial of the root conclusion under specific circumstances.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(query disagree R1)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break it down step by step according to the provided legal provisions and the structure required for the Legal AI domain.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 542(1) seeks to establish when an obligee may immediately cancel a contract without making a prior demand due to specific circumstances related to the performance of the obligation by the obligor. Therefore, the root node can be identified as:

- **R1**: An obligee may immediately cancel a contract under certain specified conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that validate or invalidate the conclusion include:
- **A1**: Impossibility of performance.
- **A2**: Manifestation of intention to refuse performance.
- **A3**: Time-sensitive nature of the obligation.
- **A4**: Likelihood of non-performance despite demand.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **A1** (Impossibility of performance):
  - **B1**: Whole obligation is impossible to perform.
  - **B2**: Part of the obligation is impossible to perform, affecting the contract's purpose.
- Under **A2** (Manifestation of intention to refuse performance):
  - **B3**: Obligor manifests refusal to perform the whole obligation.
  - **B4**: Obligor manifests refusal to perform part of the obligation, which affects the contract's purpose.
- Under **A3** (Time-sensitive nature of the obligation):
  - **B5**: Failure to perform at a specific time or within a specified period when the contract's nature requires timeliness.
- Under **A4** (Likelihood of non-performance despite demand):
  - **B6**: It is obvious that the obligor will not perform the obligation sufficiently to achieve the contract's purpose even if demanded.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**
- **(B4 supports A2)**
- **(B5 supports A3)**
- **(B6 supports A4)**
- Each abstract factor (A1, A2, A3, A4) supports the root node **R1** because they all provide conditions under which a contract can be immediately cancelled.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "If, due to the nature of the contract or a manifestation of intention by the parties, the purpose of the contract cannot be achieved unless the obligation is performed at a specific time on a specific date or within a certain period of time, and the obligor fails to perform the obligation at that time or before that period of time expires, the validity of the obligation will be extinguished without cancelling the contract by operation of law."

This query aligns with **B5** because it discusses a scenario where the timeliness of performance is crucial for achieving the contract's purpose, and failure to meet this timeframe results in a specific outcome. Therefore:

- **(query entails B5)**

The root node **R1** concerns conditions under which an obligee can immediately cancel a contract. The query, however, suggests that in a time-sensitive scenario where performance is not made on time, the obligation's validity is extinguished without the contract being cancelled by operation of law. This seems to disagree with the general premise of **R1**, which focuses on cancellation due to non-performance under specific conditions. Thus:

- **(query disagree R1)**

After rejustification, considering the nuances of legal interpretation and the specifics of the query and the root node, it's clear that the initial assessment correctly identifies the relationship between the query and the base-level factor but may require a nuanced understanding regarding the agreement or disagreement with the root node. The critical aspect is whether the scenario described in the query directly leads to contract cancellation as per **R1** or suggests an alternative outcome (obligation's validity being extinguished without cancellation). Given this, the initial conclusion stands, but it's essential to recognize that legal interpretations can be complex and context-dependent.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query against this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the outcome or legal conclusion established by the article. In this case:
- **R1**: If one of the co-owners waives interest or dies without an heir, the waived interest belongs to the other co-owners.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion.
- **A1**: Co-ownership of a property.
- **A2**: Waiver of interest or death of a co-owner without an heir.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- **B1** (under A1): Equal ratio of co-ownership (e.g., 1:1).
- **B2** (under A2): Death of a co-owner without any heirs or persons with special connections.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor and base-level factor must have a directed link:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Having an equal ratio of co-ownership supports the condition of co-ownership.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Death without heirs supports the condition of waiver of interest or death without an heir.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Co-ownership is a prerequisite for the rule to apply, supporting the root conclusion.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The event of waiving interest or dying without an heir directly leads to the conclusion about ownership transfer.

### Justification
Given the query: "In cases where person A and person B co-own building X at a ratio of 1:1, if person A dies and had no heirs or persons with special connection, ownership of building X belongs to person B."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query involves equal co-ownership (1:1), which aligns with base-level factor B1.
- **(query entails B2)**: The scenario includes the death of a co-owner without heirs, matching base-level factor B2.

Considering these base-level factors are part of the structure that supports the root node R1, and given the query's specifics align with these factors:
- **(query agree R1)**: The query's outcome (ownership of building X belongs to person B after A's death without heirs) agrees with the legal conclusion established by R1.

Upon rejustification, considering the direct application of Article 255 as described and the specific conditions outlined in the query (equal co-ownership ratio and death without heirs), it's clear that both base-level factors (B1 and B2) are directly relevant to the scenario described. These factors, in turn, support the abstract factors A1 and A2, which then support the root conclusion R1 about the transfer of ownership. Thus, the agreement between the query's outcome and the root node's legal conclusion is affirmed.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 295 is to establish whether a possessor of a thing belonging to another person has the right to retain that thing until their claim related to it is satisfied. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A possessor has the right to retain possession of a thing belonging to another until their claim is satisfied.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The possessor's claim has arisen in relation to the thing and has fallen due.
- **A2**: The possession was not commenced by means of a tortious act.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2**:
- **B1**: The claim has arisen in relation to the thing.
- **B2**: The claim has fallen due.
- **B3**: Possession was commenced lawfully.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1 supports A1**): Having a claim related to the thing is essential for retaining possession.
- (**B2 supports A1**): The claim must have fallen due for the right of retention to apply.
- (**B3 supports A2**): Lawful commencement of possession is necessary for the right of retention to be valid.
- (**A1 supports R1**): If the possessor's claim is related and has fallen due, they can retain possession.
- (**A2 supports R1**): The absence of a tortious act in commencing possession supports the right to retain.

Given the query: "A right of retention is not established if the obligee with a secured claim does not possess the subject matter, and even if he/she temporarily has possession, the right shall not be established in cases where the possession commenced by means of a tortious act."

### Justification
- The query entails **B3** because it mentions that possession commencing by a tortious act negates the right of retention.
- The query agrees with **R1** in the sense that both establish conditions under which the right to retain possession is valid or not. Specifically, the query highlights scenarios where the right does not apply (lack of possession or possession through a tortious act), which indirectly supports the conditions under which **R1** would be true.

Therefore:
- (**query entails B3**)
- (**query agree R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the query against this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 304 seeks to establish that a statutory lien can be exercised not only on the subject matter of the lien but also on things including monies that the obligor is to receive as a result of certain transactions related to the subject matter, provided these are attached before payment or delivery.

- **Root Node (R1):** A statutory lien may extend to proceeds or consideration from the sale, lease, loss, or damage of the liened property.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The ability to attach future proceeds or monies before they are paid or delivered.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The applicability of statutory lien provisions to various forms of security interests, such as pledges and mortgages.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1 and A2 into more specific conditions:

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Attachment before payment or delivery is a prerequisite for exercising the lien on future proceeds.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The statutory lien provisions apply to real rights created by the obligor on the subject matter of the lien.

### 4. Establish Directed Links

- **(A1 supports R1):** The ability to attach future proceeds before payment or delivery directly supports the conclusion that a statutory lien can extend to these proceeds.
- **(B1 supports A1):** The prerequisite of attachment before payment or delivery is crucial for exercising the lien on future proceeds, thus supporting A1.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The applicability of these provisions to various security interests broadens the scope of what can be considered under a statutory lien, supporting R1.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "Extension of security interest to proceeds of collateral may be done with respect to a right of retention, a statutory lien, a pledge, and a mortgage."

- **(Query entails B1):** The query considers scenarios where attachment or consideration of future proceeds is relevant, similar to what B1 addresses.
- **(Query agrees R1):** Both the query and R1 conclude that security interests (including statutory liens) can extend to proceeds from collateral or subject matter, indicating agreement on this principle in comparable situations.

### Rejustification

Upon reevaluation, it's clear that both the initial assessment of the query entailing a base-level factor and agreeing with the root node are justified. The legal provisions and the constructed ANGELIC structure support the conclusion that various forms of security interests can extend to proceeds or consideration from the subject matter of these interests, aligning with the query's assertion.

Therefore, the final assessment remains:

- **(Query entails B1)**
- **(Query agrees R1)**

This conclusion is based on the understanding that both the query and the root node address the extension of security interests to proceeds or future considerations, with the base-level factor B1 providing a specific condition under which this can occur.

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to analyze the given query, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a party to a juridical act subject to a condition may not prejudice the other party's interests that would arise from the juridical act upon fulfillment of the condition. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A party to a conditional juridical act must not harm the other party's potential interests.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The presence of a condition precedent in a juridical act.
- **A2**: The potential for one party to prejudice the other party's future interests.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2, we get:
- **B1**: Intentional actions by one party that could harm the other party's interests before the condition is fulfilled.
- **B2**: The existence of a sales contract as a specific type of juridical act.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The presence of a condition precedent supports the need to protect potential future interests.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The potential for prejudice supports the necessity of protecting future interests.
- **(B1 supports A2)**: Intentional harmful actions are a form of prejudicing the other party's interests.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: A sales contract is an example of a juridical act that could be subject to conditions.

### Justification
Given the query about a buyer intentionally damaging an object in a sales contract subject to a condition precedent, we can see:
- **(query entails B1)**: The scenario involves intentional damage, which aligns with B1.
- To assess if the query agrees or disagrees with R1, we must consider if the action of damaging the object (while the fulfillment of the condition is uncertain) aligns with the principle that a party should not prejudice the other's potential interests. Since damaging the object directly prejudices the seller's potential future interest in the sale, it contradicts the principle stated in R1.

### Re-justification
Upon reevaluation, considering the intentional damage to the object as a clear violation of the principle to protect potential future interests, we affirm:
- **(query entails B1)**: The query scenario directly involves an action that is categorized by B1.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The buyer's action in the query directly contradicts the principle outlined in R1, as it prejudices the seller's interest.

Therefore, the output based on our analysis is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 99 and Article 106 can be combined into a single root node for simplicity, focusing on the core conclusion regarding the representation and authority in agency relationships.

- **R1**: A subagent's acts are equivalent to an agent's acts because they act in agency for the principal, not the agent, and thus it is sufficient if they indicate their acts are made on behalf of the principal.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine this legal conclusion include:

- **A1**: The scope of authority granted to the subagent.
- **A2**: The manifestation of intention by the subagent indicating they act on behalf of the principal.
- **A3**: The legal recognition of a subagent's role as directly representing the principal.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining these abstract factors into base-level factors:

- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The subagent's acts are within the scope of authority granted by the principal.
  - **B2**: The subagent's understanding and communication of their role in representing the principal.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: Clear indication by the subagent that their actions are on behalf of the principal, not the agent.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B4**: Legal provisions recognizing a subagent's direct representation of the principal.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A1**
- **B3 supports A2**
- **B4 supports A3**
- **A1 supports R1**
- **A2 supports R1**
- **A3 supports R1**

Given the query: "A subagent's acts are equivalent to an agent's acts because he/she does not act in agency for the agent, but in agency for the principle, so it is sufficient if he/she indicates that his/her acts are made on behalf of the principle."

### Justification

- The query directly addresses the scenario where a subagent acts on behalf of the principal, indicating their actions are sufficient when made on behalf of the principal. This aligns with **B3**, as it emphasizes the importance of the subagent indicating their actions are on behalf of the principal.
- Thus, (query entails B3).
- Since **B3 supports A2** and **A2 supports R1**, the query indirectly supports the root node **R1**.
- Therefore, (query agree R1).

Upon rejustification, considering the legal context provided by Articles 99 and 106, the conclusion remains consistent. The query aligns with the principle that a subagent's acts are considered as acting directly for the principal when they indicate their actions are on behalf of the principal, which is a core aspect of **R1**.

Output:
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process step by step according to the provided instructions and legal provisions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The Root Node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 210 and the query provided:
- **Root Node (R1):** C, as the superficiary of Land X, has the right to pass through Land Y without B's consent to reach a public road.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the Root Node conclusion:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The existence of a legal right for landowners or superficiaries to access public roads through neighboring lands when their own land is surrounded and has no direct access.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The application of provisions regarding neighboring relationships, including the concept of superficies and the rights associated with it.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Land X is surrounded by other lands and has no access to a public road.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The superficiary (C) of Land X seeks to pass through Land Y, which surrounds Land X, to reach a public road.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The establishment of the superficies on Land X occurred before or after structures on the boundary line were installed.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Each factor must either support or deny another factor:
- **(B1 supports A1):** The lack of access to a public road for Land X supports the need for a legal right to pass through neighboring lands.
- **(B2 supports A1):** The superficiary's intent to use the land in a manner that requires passing through neighboring lands supports the application of the right-of-way principle.
- **(A1 supports R1):** The existence of a right to access public roads through neighboring lands supports C's right to pass through Land Y without B's consent.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The application of provisions regarding neighboring relationships, including superficies rights, supports the legal basis for C's action.

### Justification
Given the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure:
- **(query entails B1):** The query specifies that Land X is surrounded by other lands and has no access to a public road, which aligns with Base-Level Factor B1.
- **(query entails B2):** The query also mentions C's intention to pass through Land Y to reach a public road, aligning with Base-Level Factor B2.

Regarding the agreement or disagreement with the Root Node (R1):
- **(query agree R1):** The query and the Root Node R1 both conclude that C, as the superficiary of Land X, may pass through Land Y without the consent of B to reach a public road. This is based on the right-of-way principle for accessing public roads when one's land is surrounded by other lands.

After re-justification:
The conclusion remains that the query entails Base-Level Factors B1 and B2 and agrees with the Root Node R1 regarding C's right to pass through Land Y without B's consent. 

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 677-2(2) is that a new partner admitted to a partnership after it is formed is not liable for the obligations of the partnership that arose before their admission.
   - **Root Node (R1):** A new partner in a partnership is not liable for pre-existing obligations.

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factors substantiating this conclusion include the timing of the partner's admission and the principle of liability for partnership debts.
   - **Abstract Factor (A1):** Timing of Partner Admission
   - **Abstract Factor (A2):** Liability Principle for Partnership Debts

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, a base-level factor could be the specific moment or condition under which a partner is considered admitted.
   - For A2, a base-level factor could be the legal doctrine that partners are only liable for debts incurred during their membership.
   - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Admission After Partnership Formation
   - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Non-Retroactive Liability Doctrine

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **(B1 supports A1)**: Being admitted after the partnership formation directly supports the timing factor.
   - **(B2 supports A2)**: The non-retroactive liability doctrine directly supports the liability principle.
   - **(A1 supports R1)**: The timing of admission supports the root conclusion about liability.
   - **(A2 supports R1)**: The liability principle supports the root conclusion about liability.

Given the query, "A new partner that is admitted to a partnership after it is formed is not liable to perform the obligations of the partnership that arose before that partner's admission," we can analyze its relationship with the constructed ANGELIC structure:

- **(query entails B1)**: The query directly involves a scenario where a new partner is admitted after the partnership formation, aligning with Base-Level Factor B1.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query's statement about non-liability for pre-existing obligations aligns with the Root Node R1.

Upon re-justification, considering the evidence and scenarios presented:
- The query indeed entails a consideration of the timing of partner admission (B1), as it specifically mentions admission after partnership formation.
- The query agrees with the root conclusion (R1) regarding non-liability for pre-existing obligations upon partnership entry.

Therefore, the final output is:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 587 seeks to establish that a loan for consumption becomes effective when certain conditions are met. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A loan for consumption is considered effective.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion of R1. Based on Article 587, we can identify:
- **A1**: The receipt of money or any other thing by one party from another.
- **A2**: The promise to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific conditions gives us:
- **B1** (under A1): Receipt of money.
- **B2** (under A1): Receipt of any other thing.
- **B3** (under A2): Promise to return the same type of thing.
- **B4** (under A2): Promise to return the thing in the same quality.
- **B5** (under A2): Promise to return the thing in the same quantity.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Each abstract factor supports the root node, and each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor. Thus:
- **A1 supports R1**
- **A2 supports R1**
- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A1**
- **B3 supports A2**
- **B4 supports A2**
- **B5 supports A2**

Given the query: "In cases where a lender gives money to a third party the borrower designates, a monetary loan for consumption shall be effective."

### Justification:
The query entails **B1** because it involves the receipt of money, which is a specific scenario covered by B1. Thus, (query entails B1).

Regarding agreement with the root node R1, since the query specifies conditions under which a loan for consumption is considered effective (involving the receipt of money), and this aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 587 for a loan to be effective, we can say that the query agrees with R1. Therefore, (query agree R1).

After careful reconsideration, the justification stands as the query directly pertains to the effectiveness of a loan for consumption under specific conditions (receipt of money), which aligns with the base-level factor B1 and supports the root node's conclusion about what makes a loan for consumption effective.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node is determined by identifying the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Given Article 334, which discusses the conflict between a statutory lien and a pledge on movables, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A statutory lien over movables shall prevail over a pledge of movables.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the conclusion established by the root node. From Articles 330 and 334, we can derive the following abstract factors:
- **A1**: The existence of competing statutory liens against the same movables.
- **A2**: The priority order among different types of statutory liens as defined in Article 330.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific base-level factors, we consider scenarios where these abstract factors apply directly to the root node's conclusion:
- **B1** (supports A1): The presence of a statutory lien for preservation of movables.
- **B2** (supports A1): The existence of a pledge on the same movables.
- **B3** (supports A2): The application of priority order among statutory liens as per Article 330(1).

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **B1 supports A1**: The presence of a statutory lien for preservation of movables contributes to the scenario where competing statutory liens exist.
- **B2 supports A1**: The existence of a pledge on the same movables is part of the conflict with statutory liens.
- **B3 supports A2**: The application of priority order directly influences which type of lien prevails.

Given these definitions and links, let's evaluate the query:
- Query: "The statutory lien over movables shall prevail over the pledge of movables."

### Justification
- The query directly aligns with the scenario where a statutory lien (especially for preservation of movables) is in conflict with a pledge on movables. This situation is covered by **B1** and **B2**, which support **A1**, indicating competing liens are present.
- Since Article 334 specifies that the pledgee has the same rights as the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank, but the overall implication from both articles (especially when considering priority orders) suggests that statutory liens have specific priorities and conditions under which they prevail over pledges.

### Entailment and Agreement
- **(query entails B1)**: Because the query involves a scenario with a statutory lien for preservation of movables.
- **(query agrees R1)**: The query statement aligns with the conclusion that, in certain circumstances defined by law (such as priority orders), a statutory lien over movables shall prevail over a pledge of movables.

Upon careful consideration and reevaluation, it's clear that the structure constructed accurately represents the relationships between different legal factors regarding statutory liens and pledges on movables. The query directly pertains to base-level factors related to competing liens and agrees with the root node's conclusion under specific conditions outlined in the provided articles.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 126 is that the right to rescind an act is extinguished by prescription if it is not exercised within five years from the time when it becomes possible to ratify the act or if 20 years have passed from the time of the act.
- **Root Node (R1):** The right to rescind an act is extinguished by prescription under specific time conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The passage of a specified period (five years from the possibility of ratification or 20 years from the act) supports the extinguishment of the right to rescind.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The existence of conditions allowing for ratification of the act supports the timing of when the prescription period begins.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The right to rescind an act induced by fraud is subject to a five-year prescription period from the time the fraud could have been discovered, supporting A1.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The 20-year limitation from the time of the act applies regardless of when the possibility for ratification arises, also supporting A1.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **Link:** B1 supports A1 because it specifies a condition under which the prescription period applies.
- **Link:** B2 supports A1 as it provides an alternative timeframe for the extinguishment of the right to rescind.
- **Link:** A1 supports R1 since it directly contributes to the conditions under which the right to rescind is extinguished.

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation Format
Adhering to the conventions:
- Root Node: R1
- Abstract Factors: A1, A2
- Base-Level Factors: B1, B2
- Links represented as (B1 supports A1), (A1 supports R1), etc.

Given the query: "The right to rescind an act induced by fraud is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise the right within five years from the time of the act."

### Justification
- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query considers a scenario similar to B1, focusing on the extinguishment of the right to rescind due to prescription in cases involving fraud. Thus, (query entails B1).
- **Agreement with Root Node:** Since both the query and R1 deal with the extinguishment of the right to rescind an act by prescription under specific time conditions, they are considering comparable scenarios. The query specifies a condition (within five years from the time of the act) that aligns with the principle established in R1, which allows for the extinguishment of the right to rescind after a certain period. Therefore, (query agrees R1).

After careful consideration and re-justification:
The initial analysis correctly identifies that the query entails B1 because both consider scenarios involving fraud and prescription periods. Additionally, it's clear that the query aligns with the principle outlined in R1 regarding the extinguishment of the right to rescind an act by prescription under specific conditions.

**Final Output:**
- (query entails B1)
- (query agrees R1)

60 correct 29 wrongs 89 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's first analyze the provided articles and query to construct the ANGELIC structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 120 and Article 122 can be summarized as follows:
- **Root Node (R1):** A voidable act cannot be rescinded after ratification by the authorized person.
  
This root node represents the core legal conclusion derived from the articles.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The qualified legal capacity of the person performing the act.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The ratification of a voidable act by an authorized person.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The person performing the act is under curatorship.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The act has been ratified by the legal representative.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)** because being under curatorship directly impacts one's qualified legal capacity to perform acts without oversight.
- **(B2 supports A2)** since ratification by a legal representative is a direct condition for preventing the rescission of a voidable act.
- **(A1 supports R1)** as it provides a basis for why certain acts are voidable in the first place, linking back to the conditions under which an act can be rescinded or not.
- **(A2 denies the possibility of rescinding an act after ratification, thus supports R1)** since it directly addresses the outcome of ratification on the act's voidability.

### Justifying Query Entailment and Agreement with Root
Given the query: "A, a person under curatorship, may not rescind a judicial act by A after the legal representative ratifies the judicial act."

- **(Query entails B1)** because the query specifically mentions A being under curatorship.
- **(Query entails B2)** since it talks about the legal representative ratifying the judicial act.

Considering these base-level factors, we see that they directly apply to the scenario described in the query. The query's situation aligns with the conditions outlined by the articles and our constructed ANGELIC structure.

### Agreement with Root
The query essentially states that after a legal representative's ratification, A cannot rescind the judicial act. This is in line with **Root Node (R1)**, which concludes that a voidable act cannot be rescinded after ratification by an authorized person.

Therefore:
- **(Query agrees R1)** because both the query and the root node conclude that once an act has been ratified by the appropriate authority, it cannot be rescinded by the individual who performed the act under certain conditions (like being under curatorship).

After rejustifying, the conclusion remains consistent: the query aligns with the base-level factors and agrees with the root node's verdict.

61 correct 29 wrongs 90 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break it down step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of the article is to establish that a manifestation of intention can be voidable under certain conditions related to mistakes in understanding or intentions. Thus, the root node could be defined as:

- **R1**: A manifestation of intention is voidable due to mistake.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The presence of a material mistake regarding the circumstances of the juridical act.
- **A2**: The indication that specific circumstances are being taken as the basis for the juridical act.
- **A3**: Gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining these abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we can have:
  - **B1**: The mistake relates to an essential element of the contract.
  - **B2**: The person lacked the intention corresponding to their manifestation of intention.
- Under **A3**, we can consider:
  - **B3**: The other party was aware or should have been aware of the mistake due to gross negligence.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A1**
- **B3 supports A3** (in the context that if B3 is true, it impacts the validity of the rescission)
- **A1 supports R1**
- **A2 supports R1** (as it clarifies under what conditions a manifestation can be rescinded)
- **A3 denies R1** (because gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation generally prevents them from rescinding, unless certain exceptions apply)

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation Format

All nodes are labeled according to the specified convention. Links are represented as supporting or denying relationships between factors.

### Justification

Given the query about person C being unaware that the ownership of real property L belonged to person A at the time of the execution of the sales contract, this scenario directly relates to **B1** because it involves a mistake regarding an essential element (ownership) of the contract. Thus:

- **(query entails B1)**

Considering the root node **R1**, which states that a manifestation of intention is voidable due to mistake, and comparing it with the query's situation where person C's lack of knowledge about the true owner leads to an ineffective contract (implying the sales contract between B and C might be considered voidable due to this essential mistake), we can say:

- **(query agree R1)**

After careful reconsideration, the analysis holds because both the query and the root node **R1** concern situations where mistakes in understanding or intention can lead to a manifestation of intention being voidable. The specifics of the query align with the conditions outlined for when such manifestations can be considered voidable, particularly concerning essential elements like ownership.

Therefore, the final justification remains that the query entails a base-level factor related to essential mistakes and agrees with the root node regarding the voidability of a manifestation of intention due to mistake.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this framework, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article seeks to establish that general statutory liens may be duly asserted against obligees without special security, even if the liens are not registered with respect to the relevant immovables, except for registered third parties. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: A general statutory lien can be asserted against an obligee without registration.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The requirement of registration for asserting a general statutory lien.
- A2: The exception for registered third parties.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

For A1, we can refine it further into:
- B1: The lack of registration does not invalidate the assertion of a general statutory lien against an obligee.
- B2: Registration is necessary to assert a general statutory lien against a registered third party.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- B1 supports A1
- B2 denies A1 (since it introduces an exception where registration matters)
- A1 supports R1 (as it directly addresses the conditions under which a general statutory lien can be asserted)
- A2 denies R1 (because it specifies a condition—registered third parties—where the assertion might not hold without registration)

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria

Given the above steps, we have:
- Root Node: R1
- Abstract Factors: A1, A2
- Base-Level Factors: B1, B2
- Directed Links:
  - (B1 supports A1)
  - (B2 denies A1)
  - (A1 supports R1)
  - (A2 denies R1)

### Evaluating the Query

The query states: "A general statutory lien has priority over a registered mortgage existing on an immovable property even if such general statutory lien is not registered on such property."

This scenario considers the situation where a general statutory lien's effectiveness or priority is questioned due to its lack of registration, which aligns with the considerations in B1. Thus:
- (query entails B1)

Since B1 supports A1 and A1 supports R1, and given that the query directly pertains to the assertion of a general statutory lien without registration having priority over other claims (like registered mortgages), we can infer that:
- (query agree R1)

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of the legal provisions and the constructed ANGELIC structure, it's clear that the query aligns with the base-level factor B1, which in turn supports the root node R1. This alignment suggests that both the query and the root node R1 present a scenario where registration is not seen as a necessary condition for the assertion or priority of a general statutory lien, at least under certain circumstances (excluding registered third parties).

Therefore, after careful consideration and reevaluation:
- The final assessment remains that (query entails B1) and (query agree R1).

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the query against this framework, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 246 is to establish that the ownership of a processed thing belongs to the owner of the material unless the value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the material, in which case the processor acquires ownership.

- **R1**: The processor acquires ownership of the processed thing when the value derived from the labor significantly exceeds the value of the materials.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors are:
- **A1**: The value comparison between the work done and the material's value.
- **A2**: The provision of materials by the processor.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining **A1** and **A2**:
- **B1**: The processor uses only the other person's materials.
- **B2**: The value derived from the work exceeds the value of the materials.
- **B3**: The processor provides a portion of the materials.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Using only the other person's materials is a scenario where the comparison between labor value and material value becomes relevant.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): The excess value derived from work directly influences the ownership determination based on **A1**.
- (**B3** supports **A2**): Providing materials is a condition that affects how ownership is determined, as per **A2**.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): If the value of labor exceeds material value, it supports the processor acquiring ownership.
- (**A2** denies **R1** under certain conditions): The provision of materials by the processor can affect the acquisition of ownership but does so in a nuanced way that depends on the value comparison.

### ANGELIC Structure:
- **R1**: Processor acquires ownership if labor value exceeds material value.
- **A1**: Value comparison between work and material.
  - **B1**: Using only other person's materials.
  - **B2**: Labor value exceeds material value.
- **A2**: Provision of materials by the processor.
  - **B3**: Processor provides a portion of materials.

### Query Evaluation:
Given query: "If a processor uses only other's woods as materials and contributes work to them, the processor shall acquire ownership of the thing when the value derived from the work significantly exceeds the value of the materials."

- The query directly aligns with **B1** (using only other person's materials) and **B2** (labor value exceeding material value), which means (**query entails B1**) and (**query entails B2**).
- Since both **B1** and **B2** support **A1**, and **A1** supports **R1**, the query is in agreement with the root node's condition for the processor acquiring ownership.
- Therefore, (**query agrees R1**).

Upon reevaluation:
The query's conditions (using only other person's materials and labor value exceeding material value) directly map onto the base-level factors **B1** and **B2**, which in turn support the abstract factor **A1** and subsequently the root node **R1**. This confirms that the initial assessment of agreement between the query and the root node is correct, given the specific conditions outlined.

Thus, the final output is:
- (**query entails B1**)
- (**query entails B2**)
- (**query agrees R1**)

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 278 is to establish the duration and conditions for farming rights. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** A farming right has a specific duration.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion about the duration of farming rights include:
- **A1:** The specified duration of the farming right.
- **A2:** Renewal conditions for the farming right.
- **A3:** Default duration if not specified.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For each abstract factor, we can refine them further:
- For **A1**, base-level factors could include:
  - **B1:** The minimum duration of the farming right is 20 years.
  - **B2:** The maximum duration of the farming right is 50 years.
- For **A2**:
  - **B3:** Renewal of the farming right does not extend beyond 50 years from the renewal time.
- For **A3**:
  - **B4:** If no duration is specified, the default duration is 30 years unless there are contrary customs.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A1**
- **B3 supports A2**
- **B4 supports A3**
- **A1 supports R1**
- **A2 supports R1**
- **A3 supports R1**

Given the query "A farming right may not be established gratuitously," we need to determine if it entails any base-level factors and whether it agrees or disagrees with the root node.

### Justification
The query does not directly relate to the duration of farming rights but rather touches on the conditions under which a farming right can be established (gratuitously or not). The provided articles do not address the issue of gratuitous establishment directly, so we cannot derive a direct link between the query and any base-level factors regarding duration.

However, considering the context, the query seems to introduce a new condition (gratuitous establishment) that is not addressed by the base-level factors derived from Article 278. Since none of the base-level factors (B1, B2, B3, B4) directly address the concept of "gratuitous" establishment, we cannot say the query entails any of these base-level factors based on the information given.

Regarding agreement with the root node (R1), the query introduces a different aspect of farming rights (the conditions under which they can be established) rather than challenging or supporting the duration aspect directly. Therefore, it does not directly agree or disagree with R1, as R1 is focused on the duration of farming rights, not the terms of their establishment.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis:
- The query does not entail any base-level factors (B1, B2, B3, B4) because it addresses a different aspect of farming rights.
- The query neither agrees nor disagrees with R1, as it pertains to a separate issue (conditions of establishment vs. duration).

Thus, the formal representation based on the provided instructions would not directly link the query to any base-level factor or the root node in terms of agreement or disagreement due to the difference in subject matter addressed by the query and the articles.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 101 seeks to establish that if an agent is entrusted with performing a specific juridical act and performs it according to the principal's instructions, the principal cannot assert the agent's lack of knowledge of a particular circumstance without negligence when the principal was also negligent in not knowing that circumstance. Thus, the Root Node (R1) can be determined as:
- **R1:** "A principal may not claim an agent's ignorance of a circumstance due to the principal's own negligence."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors here include:
- The agent acting according to the principal's instructions.
- The presence or absence of negligence on the part of the principal regarding knowledge of specific circumstances.
- The impact of the principal's negligence on claims about the agent's knowledge.

Let's denote these as:
- **A1:** "Agent acts in accordance with instructions."
- **A2:** "Presence of principal's negligence regarding circumstance knowledge."

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, we can refine it further into more specific conditions, such as:
- **B1:** "The agent performs the juridical act exactly as instructed by the principal."
- For **A2**, a refinement could be:
- **B2:** "The principal's negligence directly relates to not knowing a circumstance that affects the juridical act."

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The agent following instructions directly supports the notion that the agent acted in accordance with those instructions.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The principal's direct negligence in not knowing a circumstance supports the fact of their negligence regarding knowledge of circumstances.
- Given the context, we see that both **A1** and **A2** support **R1**, because if an agent acts according to instructions and the principal was negligent, then it reinforces the root node's conclusion:
  - **(A1 supports R1)**: The agent acting as instructed underlines the principal's responsibility.
  - **(A2 supports R1)**: The presence of the principal's negligence directly supports the idea that they cannot claim ignorance on the part of the agent due to their own fault.

### Justification
Given the query, "In cases an agent is entrusted to perform any specific juristic act, if the agent performs such act in accordance with the instructions of the principal, the principal may not assert that the agent did not know a particular circumstance without negligence which the principal did not know due to his/her negligence," we can see:
- **(query entails B1)**: The query specifically mentions the agent performing the act according to instructions, aligning with **B1**.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query's conclusion about the principal not being able to assert the agent's ignorance due to their own negligence directly agrees with **R1**.

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and relationships established:
- The presence of **B1** (agent acting as instructed) supports **A1**, which in turn supports **R1**.
- The query aligns with the conditions outlined in both **B1** and the overall conclusion of **R1**, reinforcing that in such scenarios, the principal cannot claim the agent's ignorance due to their own negligence.

Therefore, the final output based on the provided instructions is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 395 seeks to establish that a person using or profiting from a mortgaged building under certain conditions is not required to deliver the building to the purchaser until six months have passed from the time of purchase at auction. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A mortgaged building user is allowed to suspend vacation of the building to the purchaser for up to 6 months after the auction.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The user has been using or profiting from the building since before the commencement of auction procedures.
- **A2**: The user is using or profiting from the building by virtue of a lease given after the commencement of auction procedures by the administrator of compulsory administration or execution against earnings from immovable collateral.
- **A3**: The purchaser has not issued a notice demanding payment for the use of the building with a reasonable period for payment.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2** into more specific base-level factors:
- **B1**: The user was already occupying or using the building before auction proceedings began.
- **B2**: The lease under which the user is profiting from the building was given by the administrator of compulsory administration after auction procedures started.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links include:
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Being a pre-auction user supports the condition for delayed vacation.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): Having a post-auction lease from the administrator supports the condition for delayed vacation.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Pre-auction use supports the right to delay vacation.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): Post-auction lease supports the right to delay vacation.
- (**A3** supports **R1**): Lack of a payment demand notice from the purchaser supports the delayed vacation.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "A person who uses a mortgaged building based on a lease that may not be asserted against the mortgagee may suspend the vacation of that building to the purchaser for up to 6 months from the time that the purchaser purchased the building in cases where the building was auctioned, if he/she has been using it prior to the commencement of auction proceedings."
- The query entails **B1** because both consider a scenario where the user was occupying the building before auction proceedings.
- The query agrees with **R1** because both conclude that under specified conditions (like pre-auction use), the user can delay vacation of the building for up to 6 months.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)
