======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to analyze the given query in relation to this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 698, the root node can be identified as:

- **R1**: A manager is not liable for damage resulting from benevolent intervention in another's business unless the manager has acted in bad faith or with gross negligence.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion. For Article 698, we can derive:

- **A1**: The presence of benevolent intentions behind the manager's intervention.
- **A2**: The absence of bad faith on the part of the manager.
- **A3**: The absence of gross negligence in the manager's actions.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Base-level factors are more specific conditions or scenarios that either support or deny the abstract factors:

- **B1** (supporting A1): The intervention was solely to protect the principal from imminent danger.
- **B2** (supporting A2): The manager acted with good faith, believing their actions would benefit the principal.
- **B3** (supporting A3): The manager exercised reasonable care in their intervention.

Each base-level factor has a support link to its respective abstract parent. For example:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3

### 4. Establish Directed Links of Abstract Factors

Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination (R1) or another abstract factor:

- **A1 supports R1**: The presence of benevolent intentions validates the non-liability verdict.
- **A2 supports R1**: The absence of bad faith supports the manager's non-liability.
- **A3 supports R1**: The absence of gross negligence also supports the non-liability verdict.

No abstract factor denies another in this context, as all conditions (benevolent intentions, absence of bad faith, and absence of gross negligence) work together to support the root conclusion.

### Analysis of Query

Given the query: "A manager must engage in management exercising care identical to that he/she exercises for his/her own property."

- This query entails **B3**, as both consider the exercise of appropriate care in management decisions.
  - (query entails B3)
  
The query agrees with the principle behind **R1** because it implies a standard of care (exercising care identical to that for one's own property) which, if followed, would support the manager's non-liability under the conditions outlined in Article 698. Therefore:
- (query agree R1)

Upon re-justification, considering the emphasis on exercising care similar to what one would for their own property aligns with demonstrating a lack of gross negligence and potentially supports benevolent intentions, reinforcing the agreement with **R1**.

Thus, the final analysis confirms that the query entails a base-level factor related to the exercise of care and agrees with the root node regarding non-liability under specific conditions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 97 seeks to establish that "a manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party." Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A contract is formed when a manifestation of intention (e.g., acceptance) reaches the counterparty.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The effectiveness of a manifestation of intention depends on it being noticed by the other party.
- **A2**: Preventing notice without a legitimate reason does not invalidate the effectiveness of the manifestation at the time it would have normally been received.
- **A3**: Post-manifestation changes in the legal capacity of the person making the manifestation do not affect its effectiveness.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down each abstract factor into more specific conditions:
- From **A1**, we get:
  - **B1**: The manifestation must be received by the counterparty to be effective.
  - **B2**: The method of notification is such that it would normally reach the counterparty (e.g., sent to the correct address, via an appropriate medium).
- From **A2**, we have:
  - **B3**: If a party prevents notice without a valid reason, the manifestation is considered received at the time it should have been.
- From **A3**:
  - **B4**: Death, loss of mental capacity, or legal restrictions after sending the manifestation do not negate its effect.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Each abstract factor supports or denies the root determination:
- **A1 supports R1**: The effectiveness of a manifestation upon notice validates the formation of a contract.
- **A2 supports R1**: Even if notice is prevented without reason, considering it received at the normal time upholds contract formation principles.
- **A3 supports R1**: Post-manifestation changes in legal capacity do not undermine the contract's validity.

Given the query: "The effect of manifestation of intention occurs when it arrives at the counterparty, and thus, a contract with a person at a distance forms when the manifestation of intention of acceptance arrives at the counterparty."

### Justification
- **(query entails B1)**: The query directly aligns with the condition that a manifestation must be received by the counterparty to be effective.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query supports the root conclusion that a contract is formed when the manifestation of intention (acceptance) reaches the counterparty, as both emphasize the importance of receipt for contract formation.

Upon rejustification, it's clear that the query specifically addresses the timing and conditions under which a contract is considered formed, directly aligning with **B1** and supporting the overall conclusion presented by **R1**. Therefore, the initial justification holds true upon further consideration.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 462 seeks to establish that a third party who has no interest in an obligation may not guarantee an obligation against the will of the obligor, but if they do, there are specific rights and obligations that apply.

- **Root Node (R1):** A third party without interest may guarantee an obligation against the obligor's will, with specified consequences.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors include:
- The act of giving a guarantee without being requested by the principal obligor.
- The right to reimbursement for the guarantor.
- The conditions under which the guarantor can demand performance from the obligee based on set-off grounds claimed by the principal obligor.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Guarantee given without request.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Right to reimbursement for the guarantor.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Conditions for demanding performance due to set-off claims.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down Abstract Factors into specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** A guarantee given by a third party without interest and without request from the principal obligor.
    - **Support Link:** (B1 supports A1)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The guarantor's right to reimbursement is limited to the extent currently enriched.
    - **Support Link:** (B2 supports A2)
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The guarantor may demand performance from the obligee if the principal obligor has set-off grounds against the obligee prior to the demand for reimbursement.
    - **Support Link:** (B3 supports A3)

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **Support Link:** (A1 supports R1) because giving a guarantee without request leads to specific legal consequences.
- **Support Link:** (A2 supports R1) as it outlines the guarantor's rights.
- **Support Link:** (A3 supports R1) since it specifies conditions for demanding performance.

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root
Given the query: "A third party who has no interest in an obligation may not guarantee an obligation against the will of the obligor."

- The query directly relates to the situation described by **Base-Level Factor (B1)**, which is about a guarantee given without request or interest. Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.
- Since B1 supports A1, and A1 in turn supports R1, the query indirectly agrees with the structure of legal consequences outlined in **R1**. However, the query's statement seems to assert a prohibition ("may not guarantee"), which might be misleading because the article actually discusses what happens if such a guarantee is given, rather than prohibiting it outright.
- Upon closer examination, the query appears to misinterpret the nuances of Article 462, which does not explicitly state that a third party "may not" give a guarantee against the will of the obligor but rather outlines the consequences and rights involved if they do. Thus, **(query disagree R1)** in terms of implying a prohibition where the article provides a framework for handling such situations.

### Re-Justification
Upon re-evaluation, considering the structure and the intent of Article 462, it's clear that while the query touches on the scenario described by B1, its assertion about not being able to guarantee against the will of the obligor does not align with the article's focus on consequences rather than prohibitions. Therefore, the disagreement is more about the interpretation of what is permissible or not under the law as presented in Article 462.

Given this analysis:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the information provided and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 145 is that the court may not make a judicial decision relying on prescription unless a party invokes it. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:

- **R1**: The court's decision on prescription can only be made if invoked by a party.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:

- **A1**: Invocation of prescription by a party.
- **A2**: Legitimate interest in the extinction of a right.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion regarding the court's decision on prescription.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)

From Abstract Factor **A1**, we can derive:

- **B1**: A party directly involved in the case invokes prescription.
- **B2**: A third-party collateral provider or guarantor invokes prescription, having a legitimate interest in the extinction of the right.

From Abstract Factor **A2**:

- **B3**: The person invoking prescription has no legitimate interest in the extinction of the right.

Each base-level factor must have a support link to its abstract parent. For example:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A1)
- (B3 denies A2)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links

The directed links can be established as follows:

- **A1** supports **R1**, because invocation of prescription by a party is necessary for the court's decision.
- **A2** supports **R1**, since having a legitimate interest in the extinction of a right is a condition under which prescription can be invoked.

However, we must consider that the query specifically mentions "the one who acquired Land X after the mortgage had been created on Land X and the creation had been registered may invoke the extinctive prescription of the secured claim under the mortgage." This scenario introduces a specific situation where the party invoking prescription is not necessarily the original owner but someone with a legitimate interest, such as an acquirer of land with a registered mortgage.

### Justification

Given the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure:

- The query entails **B2**, because it involves a third-party acquirer (after the creation and registration of the mortgage) invoking prescription, which aligns with having a legitimate interest in the extinction of the right.
  
  Therefore: (**query entails B2**)

- Considering **R1**, the root node's verdict is about the necessity of invocation for a court decision on prescription. The query agrees with this root because it discusses a scenario where an acquirer (a party with a legitimate interest) invokes prescription, which would allow the court to make a decision based on that invocation.

  Therefore: (**query agree R1**)

After careful reconsideration, the justification stands as the query indeed aligns with the conditions under which prescription can be invoked, specifically through a party with a legitimate interest (in this case, an acquirer of land with a registered mortgage), thereby supporting the root node's condition that invocation by a party is necessary for the court to decide on prescription.

Output:
- (**query entails B2**)
- (**query agree R1**)

1 correct 3 wrongs 4 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article establishes that an owner has rights to freely use, profit from, and dispose of a thing owned within the limits of laws and regulations. The root node can be determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. Thus, the root node is:
- R1: An owner's rights to use, profit from, and dispose of their property are protected by law.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: Legal protection of ownership rights.
- A2: Limitations imposed by laws and regulations on the exercise of ownership.

These abstract factors either validate or invalidate the root conclusion regarding the protection and limitations of an owner's rights.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From the abstract factor A1, we can derive base-level factors such as:
- B1: The right to use the property.
- B2: The right to profit from the property.
- B3: The right to dispose of the property.

These base-level factors specify conditions under which the legal protection of ownership rights (A1) is exercised. For A2, we have:
- B4: Compliance with laws regarding property use.
- B5: Compliance with regulations limiting profit from property.
- B6: Adherence to legal procedures for disposing of property.

Each base-level factor has a support link to its abstract parent. Thus, (B1 supports A1), (B2 supports A1), (B3 supports A1), (B4 supports A2), (B5 supports A2), and (B6 supports A2).

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- A1 supports R1 because legal protection of ownership rights validates the root conclusion.
- A2 denies R1 to some extent, as limitations imposed by laws and regulations can restrict the exercise of these rights.

The query states that if person B hinders the exercise of ownership for a thing owned by person A using methods other than possession of the thing, person A's ability to demand the removal or discontinuance of the disturbance from B based on ownership is limited to when person A incurs serious and considerable irreparable damage due to person B's disturbance.

### Analysis of Query
The query entails base-level factor B1 because it considers a scenario where the exercise of ownership (the right to use the property) is hindered, which aligns with the situation described in B1. Therefore, (query entails B1).

Regarding the agreement or disagreement with the root R1:
- The query implies that there are limitations on when an owner can demand protection against disturbances to their property rights, specifically requiring "serious and considerable irreparable damage." This suggests a nuanced view of ownership rights protection, which somewhat aligns with but also adds conditions to the absolute protection implied by R1. However, since R1 primarily focuses on the existence of protected rights rather than the conditions under which they can be enforced, the query's emphasis on specific conditions for enforcement does not directly refute R1 but rather specifies a scenario where those rights might be asserted.

Thus, considering the nuances and focusing strictly on whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root verdict in a comparable situation:
- (query agree R1), as both acknowledge the importance of protecting ownership rights, though the query introduces specific conditions under which these protections can be invoked.

Upon rejustification, this analysis holds because the query's introduction of conditions for invoking protection does not negate the existence or importance of those protections but rather details a scenario affecting their application.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the provided task, let's break down the process step by step according to the ANGELIC structure formation criteria.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 724 is that the claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription if not exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: The claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription when the right is not exercised within 20 years.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- A1: The time limit for exercising the right to compensation.
- A2: The occurrence of a tortious act.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion about prescription.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down A1 and A2 into more specific conditions:
- B1 (child of A1): The right to compensation is not exercised within 20 years.
- B2 (child of A2): A tortious act has occurred, causing loss or damage.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- A1 supports R1 because if the right to compensation is not exercised within 20 years, it directly leads to the extinction of the claim by prescription.
- A2 supports R1 since the occurrence of a tortious act is a prerequisite for considering compensation and thus its prescription.

The directed links are:
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)

### Justification
Given the query: "The claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription when the right is not exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act."

This query directly aligns with the conditions outlined in B1 and the overall conclusion in R1. Therefore:
- (query entails B1) because both consider the scenario where the right to compensation is not exercised within 20 years.
- (query agree R1) since both the query and R1 conclude that the claim is extinguished by prescription under the same condition.

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and the information provided:
- The query indeed entails B1 as it specifies a scenario where the right to compensation is not exercised within the given timeframe.
- The query agrees with R1 because both state that the claim for compensation is extinguished by prescription if the conditions (not exercising the right within 20 years) are met.

Therefore, the final justification remains:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

 To address the given problem, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined in the prompt.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable, with exceptions for daily necessities or acts involved in day-to-day life. Thus, the root node can be formulated as:
- **R1**: A contract involving an adult ward can be rescinded by their guardian, except in cases of purchasing daily necessities.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that either substantiate or undermine this legal conclusion include:
- **A1**: The act being voidable due to the ward's status.
- **A2**: Exceptions for acts related to daily life or necessities.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors
Breaking down abstract factors into base-level factors:
- From **A1**:
  - **B1**: The contract involves an adult ward.
  - **B2**: The guardian's right to rescind the contract due to the ward's status.
- From **A2**:
  - **B3**: The transaction is for a daily necessity or day-to-day life activity.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A1**
- **B3 supports A2**
- **A1 supports R1**
- **A2 denies R1** (since it's an exception to the general rule of voidability)

Given the query: In the case where an adult ward, (A), purchased a daily household item from (B), even if (B) did not know that (A) was an adult ward, his/her guardian of adult, (C), may rescind the contract for sale of the daily household item.

### Justification
- The query entails **B3** because it involves purchasing a daily household item, which can be considered a daily necessity or part of day-to-day life.
- Given that **A2 denies R1**, and considering the scenario in the query aligns with **B3**, which supports **A2**, we can infer that the query disagrees with **R1**. This is because **R1** suggests rescindability except for daily necessities, but **A2** (supported by **B3**) indicates an exception to this rule, implying that in cases of purchasing daily necessities or items for day-to-day life, the contract might not be rescinded based on the ward's status alone.

Therefore:
- (query entails B3)
- (query disagree R1)

After rejustification, considering the specifics of the scenario and the legal principles outlined:
- The purchase of a daily household item indeed falls under exceptions to the general rule of voidability.
- Thus, the guardian's ability to rescind the contract might be limited in such cases.

The conclusion remains that the query entails **B3** and disagrees with **R1**, given the context provided.

 To address the given task, let's break down the process step by step according to the provided instructions and analyze the legal provisions regarding the right of retention.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The Root Node (R) is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish. The article states that a right of retention is extinguished if the holder loses possession, except in cases where the thing retained is leased or made subject to a pledge under Article 298, paragraph (2). Thus, the root node can be formulated as:
- R1: A right of retention is extinguished when the holder loses possession, unless exceptions apply.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From the article:
- A1: Loss of possession by the holder leads to extinction of the right of retention.
- A2: Exceptions exist for leased items or those subject to a pledge under specific provisions.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- B1 (child of A1): The right of retention is extinguished if the holder loses physical control over the item.
- B2 (child of A2): Leased items or those under a pledge according to Article 298, paragraph (2), are exceptions where loss of possession does not extinguish the right.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- Support Link: (A1 supports R1) because losing possession generally leads to extinction.
- Support Link: (A2 supports R1) in the context that it specifies conditions under which R1 does not apply, thereby clarifying when R1 is true.
- Deny Link is not directly applicable here as A2 does not negate A1 but rather provides exceptions.

### Justification of Query Entailment
The query states: "A right of retention shall not be extinguished even if the holder of the right of retention loses possession of the Thing retained, but in this case, this right may not be asserted against third parties."
- This scenario seems to align with an exception rather than the general rule stated by R1. However, it introduces a new condition (assertion against third parties) not directly addressed in the initial article.

### Query Entailment and Agreement/Disagreement with Root
Given the query's specifics:
- The query does seem to introduce a nuanced scenario but essentially suggests that losing possession might not always lead to extinction under certain conditions, which aligns more closely with exceptions (like B2) rather than the general rule (R1).
- However, the introduction of "this right may not be asserted against third parties" complicates direct comparison. It implies a limitation on the right's exercise rather than its existence.
- Considering the closest alignment and focusing strictly on the retention right's extinction:
  - The query seems to disagree with R1 insofar as it suggests scenarios where loss of possession does not lead to extinction, but it introduces a condition (assertion against third parties) that wasn't part of the original article.

### Output
Given the nuanced introduction of conditions not directly addressed by the original provisions and focusing on the core issue of whether the right of retention is extinguished upon losing possession:
- The query could be seen as entailing a consideration similar to B2, given its discussion of exceptions to the general rule.
- However, due to the specific phrasing and introduction of new conditions (assertion against third parties), it's challenging to directly align with either R1 or the base-level factors without additional context.

Thus, considering the direct task requirements and focusing on the agreement/disagreement aspect regarding the most comparable scenario:
- The query introduces a nuanced view that might not fully align with either the root or base-level factors as defined by the initial analysis, primarily due to the introduction of new conditions (assertion against third parties) not addressed in the original article.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, considering the structure and requirements provided:
- The query indeed presents a scenario that could be seen as aligning with exceptions to the general rule (like those implied by B2), but it does so in a manner that introduces additional considerations.
- The core of the query seems to suggest that under certain conditions, losing possession might not extinguish the right, which can be seen as aligned with the spirit of exceptions but is presented in a unique context.

Given this, and focusing on the provided format for output:
- (query entails B2), because it discusses scenarios where the general rule might not apply, akin to exceptions.
- Considering the agreement/disagreement with R1, given the nuanced scenario presented by the query:
  - The query seems to introduce a perspective that complicates direct comparison but leans towards disagreeing with the straightforward application of R1 due to its emphasis on conditions under which the right is not extinguished and limitations on its assertion.

Thus, in terms of agreement/disagreement with the root node (R1) based on the comparable scenario:
- (query disagree R1), considering it introduces a nuanced view that suggests exceptions or additional considerations beyond the general rule stated by R1.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break it down step by step according to the provided instructions and legal provisions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 185, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: The nature of a possessor's possession changes when they manifest an intention to own.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion.
- A1: Manifestation of intention to own by the possessor.
- A2: Commencement of possession under a new title with an intention to own.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- B1 (child of A1): The possessor informs the original owner of their intention to own.
- B2 (child of A2): The possessor starts possessing the item under a new title, indicating an intention to own.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- Support Link: (B1 supports A1), because informing the owner is one way to manifest the intention to own.
- Support Link: (B2 supports A2), as starting possession under a new title indicates an intention to own.
- Support Link: (A1 supports R1), because manifesting an intention to own changes the nature of possession.
- Support Link: (A2 supports R1), since commencing possession under a new title with an intention to own also changes the nature of possession.

### Applying the Query
Given the query about B, who had been leasing movable X from A and then made an agreement to purchase X, we analyze if this scenario entails base-level factors or agrees/disagrees with the root node (R1).

### Justification
- The query involves B making an agreement to purchase X, which implies a change in the nature of possession due to an intention to own. This is similar to the scenario described by base-level factor B2, as it involves a new title (ownership) and an intention to own.
- Therefore, (query entails B2).
- Since B2 supports A2, and A2 supports R1, the query indirectly supports R1 by describing a situation where the nature of possession changes due to an intention to own, aligned with what R1 concludes.
- Hence, (query agree R1).

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, considering that the query describes a scenario where B's intention to own is manifested through an agreement to purchase, it directly aligns with the principles outlined in Article 185 and the derived root node R1. The key aspect here is the change in possession nature due to an expressed intention to own, which is central to both the query and R1.

Therefore, the final justification remains:
- (query entails B2)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 389 is that if a building is constructed on mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage, the mortgagee may auction the building together with the land under certain conditions.

- **Root Node (R1):** A mortgagee has the right to auction a building constructed on mortgaged land along with the land.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- The creation of a mortgage before the construction of the building.
- The rights of the owner of the building regarding possession of the mortgaged land.
- The condition that the mortgagee's right of priority may be exercised solely against the proceeds of the land.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The building was constructed after the creation of the mortgage.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The owner of the building has rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land that can be asserted against the mortgagee.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
From A1, we derive:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The construction of the building occurred subsequent to the establishment of the mortgage.
  
From A2, considering its impact:
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The owner of the building lacks assertable rights against the mortgagee regarding land possession.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **Support Link:** B1 supports A1, because it specifies the condition under which the mortgagee's right is considered.
- **Deny/Attack Link:** B2 denies A2, because if there are no assertable rights by the building owner against the mortgagee, A2's undermining effect on the mortgagee's auction right is negated.

- **Support Link from Abstract to Root:** A1 supports R1, as it directly validates the condition under which a mortgagee can auction the building and land.
- **Deny/Attack Link from Abstract to Root:** A2 denies R1, because if the building owner has assertable rights against the mortgagee, this undermines the mortgagee's ability to auction the building together with the land.

### Analysis of Query
Given query: "If a building is constructed on mortgaged land by a third party after creation of a mortgage, the mortgagee may auction the building together with the land."

- **Entailment:** (query entails B1), because both involve the scenario where the building's construction occurs after the mortgage was created.
  
- **Agreement/Disagreement with Root:** Considering R1 and the context provided by the query, which aligns with the conditions under which a mortgagee can auction the land and the building together (as specified in Article 389), we see that:
  - **(query agree R1)**, because both assert the right of the mortgagee to auction the building along with the land under similar conditions.

Upon re-justification, considering all aspects and implications of Article 389, it remains clear that the query aligns with the base-level factor B1 regarding the timing of construction relative to mortgage creation. Furthermore, the query supports the root determination R1, which affirms the mortgagee's right to auction the building together with the land under specified conditions. 

Thus, the conclusions based on the ANGELIC structure analysis are:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to evaluate the given query against this framework, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 97, the root node can be identified as:

- **R1**: A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party, and its effect is not impaired by subsequent events such as death, loss of mental capacity, or legal restrictions on the person making it.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion. From Article 97, we can derive:

- **A1**: The effectiveness of a manifestation of intention is contingent upon notice reaching the other party.
- **A2**: Prevention of notice without legitimate reason does not negate the effectiveness of the manifestation at the time it would have normally been received.
- **A3**: Post-manifestation events (death, loss of mental capacity, legal restrictions) do not impair the effect of a manifestation of intention.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Base-level factors are specific conditions or scenarios that either substantiate or undermine the abstract factors. For each abstract factor:

- **A1** leads to:
  - **B1**: The manifestation of intention is effectively communicated to the other party.
  - **B2**: The notice reaches the other party within a specified or implied timeframe.

- **A2** leads to:
  - **B3**: The other party prevents notice without a legitimate reason, which does not affect the deemed receipt time.

- **A3** leads to:
  - **B4**: Death or loss of mental capacity after sending the notice does not invalidate its effect.
  - **B5**: Legal restrictions imposed after sending the notice do not impair its effectiveness.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links

Each abstract factor supports the root node:

- **(A1 supports R1)**: The condition of notice reaching the other party validates the effectiveness of a manifestation of intention.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The principle that prevention without reason does not negate effectiveness supports the root.
- **(A3 supports R1)**: The principle that post-manifestation events do not impair effect supports the root.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the query:

"Even if it is a contract offer with a determined consent period, if the period is before or at the same time as the arrival of the offer, it can be revoked."

This query implies a specific scenario regarding the timing of contract offers and their revocation periods. To assess whether this query entails base-level factors or agrees/disagrees with the root:

- The query specifically addresses a scenario where the consent period is before or at the same time as the arrival of the offer, which can relate to **B2** (the notice reaches the other party within a specified or implied timeframe) because it discusses timing and effectiveness.
- Thus, **(query entails B2)**.

Considering whether the query agrees or disagrees with **R1**, we examine if the scenario described by the query aligns with or contradicts the effectiveness of a manifestation of intention as outlined in **R1**. The root node focuses on when a manifestation becomes effective and factors that do not impair its effect, such as post-manifestation events. However, the query introduces a condition (revocation before or at the same time as arrival) that could be seen as preceding the manifestation's effectiveness, thus it might initially seem to disagree with **R1** by introducing an exception based on timing.

However, upon closer examination and reevaluation considering the specifics of Article 97 and the structure provided:

- The query actually aligns more closely with considerations of timing and revocation periods rather than directly challenging the core principle of when a manifestation becomes effective or its non-impairment post-manifestation.
- Thus, it's more about the specifics of contract offers and their timing rather than the general principle of effectiveness upon notice.

Given this nuanced understanding:

- **(query entails B2)** because it discusses specific conditions related to timing.
- Upon reevaluation, considering the structure and the root node's focus on effectiveness upon notice and non-impairment by subsequent events, the query does not directly disagree with **R1** but rather specifies a condition under which an offer can be revoked, which is more about the nature of offers and acceptances than the general principle of manifestation effectiveness.
- Therefore, it might seem there's a misunderstanding in initially suggesting disagreement. The query doesn't directly address the core issue of when a manifestation becomes effective or its immunity to post-manifestation impairments but rather discusses revocation conditions.

Thus, after careful consideration:

- **(query entails B2)**
- And upon reevaluation for agreement with **R1**, considering the nuance and focus of both the query and **R1**, there's an understanding that the query specifies a scenario rather than directly challenging the principle of effectiveness. However, the direct link to agree or disagree with **R1** based on provided structure and analysis leans towards not explicitly disagreeing due to addressing different aspects of contractual interactions.

Given this analysis, the focus should remain on how the query relates to specific conditions (like **B2**) rather than a broad agreement/disagreement with **R1**, which might have been prematurely concluded without full context.

 (A1 supports R1).(A2 supports R1).(A3 supports R1).(query entails B2).
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to address the query regarding the alteration of obligors with respect to a Revolving Mortgage, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 398-4, the primary conclusion is about the conditions under which changes to the scope of claims or obligors in a revolving mortgage can be made, specifically focusing on the requirement for registration before the principal is crystallized.

- **R1:** Alterations to a revolving mortgage's scope or obligors are valid if registered before the principal is crystallized.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the root conclusion. From Article 398-4, we can identify:

- **A1:** The possibility of changing the scope of claims or obligors before the principal is crystallized.
- **A2:** The requirement for registration to effect changes.
- **A3:** The independence of these changes from third-party approvals.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors specify conditions under which abstract factors apply. For each abstract factor:

- **From A1:**
  - **B1:** Changes in the scope of claims can be made before crystallization.
  - **B2:** Changes in obligors can be made before crystallization.
  
- **From A2:**
  - **B3:** Registration is necessary for changes to be considered valid after crystallization.

- **From A3:**
  - **B4:** No third-party approval, including subordinated mortgagee, is required for these changes.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root conclusion or other abstract factors:

- **Support Link:** (A1 supports R1) because the possibility of making changes before crystallization directly supports the validity of alterations under certain conditions.
- **Support Link:** (A2 supports R1) since registration is a critical condition for these changes to be valid, supporting the root conclusion about timely registration.
- **Support Link:** (A3 supports R1) as it clarifies that third-party approvals do not hinder the process, thus supporting the overall validity of alterations made before crystallization.

Given the query: "If the alteration of obligors with respect to a Revolving Mortgage is not registered before the principal is fixed, it shall be deemed that such alteration was not effected."

### Justification
- The query directly relates to **B2** because it discusses changes in obligors and the necessity of registration for these changes to be valid.
- Therefore, (query entails B2).
  
Considering the root node R1, which states alterations are valid if registered before crystallization, the query essentially agrees with this conclusion by stating that without registration before crystallization, the alteration is deemed not effected. Thus, both the query and R1 emphasize the importance of timely registration for changes to be valid.

- Hence, (query agree R1).

Upon re-justification, considering the structured approach and the content of Article 398-4, it's clear that the query directly pertains to the conditions under which alterations to a revolving mortgage are considered valid, specifically highlighting the role of registration. This aligns perfectly with the abstract and base-level factors derived from the article, reinforcing the agreement between the query and the root conclusion regarding the validity of alterations based on registration timing.

Therefore, the final justification remains:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, we will follow the step-by-step approach to construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 3-2 and related sections is that if a person making a juridical act did not have mental capacity, the juridical act is void, and there are obligations to restore or return based on specific conditions. Thus, the root node can be formulated as:
- R1: A party who enters into a contract without mental capacity must return any benefits received to the extent they are currently enriched.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The mental capacity of the person at the time of manifesting intention.
- A2: The voidness of the juridical act due to lack of mental capacity.
- A3: The obligation to restore or return benefits received under a void contract.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- B1 (child of A1): Lack of mental capacity at the time of signing the contract.
    - Support Link: (B1 supports A1)
- B2 (child of A2): The contract is deemed void ab initio due to lack of mental capacity.
    - Support Link: (B2 supports A2)
- B3 (child of A3): Receipt of payment or delivery under a void contract without knowledge of its voidness.
    - Support Link: (B3 supports A3)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- Support Link: (A1 supports R1) because lack of mental capacity is a direct reason for the contract being void and thus supports the need to return benefits.
- Support Link: (A2 supports R1) as the voidness of the contract directly leads to the obligation to restore or return.
- Support Link: (A3 supports R1) since the obligation to return benefits is a consequence of receiving under a void contract.

### Evaluating the Query
The query states: "If a party to a contract did not have mental capacity when manifesting the relevant intention and received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on the contract, the party has an obligation to return to the extent that the party retains a benefit."

- **Entails Base-Level Factor**: The query directly relates to B1 (lack of mental capacity) and implies a situation covered by B3 (receipt of benefits under a void contract). Therefore, (query entails B1) and (query entails B3).

### Agreement with Root Node
Given that the query involves a party without mental capacity receiving benefits under a void contract and concludes there's an obligation to return these benefits to the extent retained, it aligns with R1. Thus, (query agrees R1).

After re-justification, considering the structured approach and the specifics of the legal provisions provided:
- The conclusion remains that the query entails base-level factors related to mental capacity and obligations under void contracts.
- The agreement between the query's conclusion and the root node regarding the obligation to return benefits under a void contract due to lack of mental capacity stands.

Therefore, based on the constructed ANGELIC structure and the evaluation:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B3)
- (query agrees R1)

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query against this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 15 seeks to establish the conditions under which a family court may decide to commence assistance for a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The family court may commence assistance for a person with inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **A1**: Request for commencement of assistance by eligible persons (the person in question, their spouse, relative within the fourth degree of kinship, guardian, guardian's supervisor, curator, curator's supervisor, or a public prosecutor).
- **A2**: Consent of the person in question when the request is made by someone other than themselves.
- **A3**: Grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 that may prevent commencement of assistance.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factor A1:
- **B1**: The person in question requests commencement of assistance.
- **B2**: A person other than the person in question (e.g., spouse, relative, guardian) requests commencement of assistance.
  
From Abstract Factor A2:
- **B3**: The person in question consents to the commencement of assistance when requested by another.
- **B4**: The person in question does not consent to the commencement of assistance when requested by another.

From Abstract Factor A3:
- **B5**: There are grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 that prevent commencement of assistance.
- **B6**: There are no grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 that prevent commencement of assistance.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **(A1 supports R1)**: A request by eligible persons validates the commencement of assistance.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Consent of the person in question, when required, supports the commencement of assistance.
- **(A3 denies R1)**: Existence of grounds as prescribed in Article 7 or the main clause of Article 11 invalidates the commencement of assistance.

Base-level factors support their respective abstract factors:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**
- **(B4 denies A2)**
- **(B5 supports A3)**
- **(B6 denies A3)**

### Analysis of Query
The query states: "The issuance of a decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question unless the family court finds it to be suitable."

This query directly relates to the conditions under which assistance can be commenced, particularly focusing on the requirement for consent when the request is made by someone other than the person in question. It introduces an exception based on the family court's finding, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original article but pertains to the principle of requiring consent.

### Justification
- The query entails **B3** because it considers a scenario where consent is required for commencement of assistance when requested by another, aligning with the base-level factor that the person in question consents to the commencement of assistance.
- However, the introduction of "unless the family court finds it to be suitable" suggests an additional consideration not explicitly covered by the original provisions. This implies a potential deviation or addition to the conditions under which consent is required.

### Agreement with Root
Given the query's focus on the conditions for commencing assistance and its alignment with the principle of requiring consent (with an added exception), it generally agrees with **R1** in that it discusses scenarios under which assistance can be commenced. However, the introduction of the family court's suitability finding as an exception adds a nuance not directly addressed by **R1** or the original provisions.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances introduced by the query:
- The query indeed pertains to the scenario where consent is a factor (entailing **B3**), but it also introduces an element of judicial discretion ("unless the family court finds it to be suitable") that isn't directly addressed in the original article.
- This means while the query aligns with the spirit of **R1** by discussing conditions for commencement of assistance, it does so with an added layer of complexity regarding consent and judicial findings.

Thus, the output based on the analysis is:
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1), with the understanding that the agreement is within the context of discussing conditions for commencing assistance, albeit with an added nuance regarding judicial discretion.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The Root Node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 398-12 and Article 398-13, the primary focus is on the conditions under which a revolving mortgage can be assigned before the principal is crystallized.

**R1:** A revolving mortgage before the fixing of the principal can be transferred in whole or in part with the approval of the mortgagor.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract Factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion represented by the Root Node. 

- **A1:** Approval from the mortgagor is required for the assignment of a revolving mortgage.
- **A2:** The ability to divide a revolving mortgage into two and assign either part with approval.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Base-Level Factors specify conditions under which Abstract Factors are applicable.

- **B1:** Obtaining approval from the mortgagor is necessary for assigning a whole revolving mortgage.
    - Support Link: (B1 supports A1)
- **B2:** The division of a revolving mortgage requires approval from the person holding rights for which that revolving mortgage is the subject matter.
    - Support Link: (B2 supports A2)

### 4. Establish Directed Links

Directed links show how Abstract Factors support or deny the Root Node or other Abstract Factors.

- **A1** supports **R1**, because without the mortgagor's approval, the assignment cannot proceed according to the law.
    - Support Link: (A1 supports R1)
- **A2** supports **R1**, as it provides an additional condition under which a revolving mortgage can be assigned before crystallization of the principal.
    - Support Link: (A2 supports R1)

Given the query:
"Since a revolving mortgage before the fixing of principal can be described as a right which dominates the value of the maximum amount detached from the secured claim, it can be transferred in whole or in part, but since the obligor and the secured claim may change, approval must be obtained from the revolving mortgagor."

### Justification

- The query entails **B1** because both consider the necessity of obtaining approval for the assignment of a revolving mortgage.
    - (query entails B1)
- The query agrees with **R1** as it states that a revolving mortgage can be transferred in whole or in part before the principal is fixed, provided there's approval from the mortgagor, aligning with the conditions outlined by R1 for such transfers.
    - (query agree R1)

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of the legal provisions and the query:

- The focus on obtaining approval for the assignment process is central to both the query and **B1**, reinforcing that they address similar scenarios.
- The overall conclusion regarding the transferability of revolving mortgages before principal crystallization, with necessary approvals, aligns between the query and **R1**.

Therefore, the justification stands as initially concluded.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 496(1) is that as long as the obligee does not accept the deposit, or the judgment which pronounces that the deposit is effective does not become final and binding, the performer may recover the deposited thing. It implies the legal conclusion is about the conditions under which a performer can recover a deposited item.

- **Root Node (R1):** A performer can recover a deposited thing if certain conditions are met.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- The obligee's acceptance of the deposit.
- The finality and binding nature of the judgment regarding the effectiveness of the deposit.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Non-acceptance by the obligee supports the recovery.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Non-finality of the judgment regarding the deposit's effectiveness supports the recovery.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factors, we derive:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The performer can recover the deposited thing if the obligee has not accepted it.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The performer can recover the deposited thing if the judgment on the deposit's effectiveness is not final and binding.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**

### 4. Establish Directed Links
Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination:
- **A1 supports R1:** Non-acceptance by the obligee is a condition that allows recovery.
- **A2 supports R1:** The non-finality of the judgment is another condition allowing recovery.

There are no deny links in this scenario as all conditions provided support the possibility of recovery under certain circumstances.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "If a performer lawfully deposits the subject matter of the performance with an official depository, the performer may not recover the deposited thing."

- **(Query entails B3):** This would be a new base-level factor considering the scenario of lawful deposit with an official depository. However, based on our structure, this is not directly addressed by B1 or B2 but implies a different condition (lawful deposit with an official depository) that might affect recovery.
- **(Query disagree R1):** The query suggests that under certain conditions (lawful deposit with an official depository), the performer may not recover the deposited thing, which disagrees with R1. R1 states that a performer can recover the deposited thing if certain conditions are met, implying flexibility based on those conditions.

Upon re-justification, considering the specifics of the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure:
- The query introduces a condition (lawful deposit with an official depository) not explicitly covered by B1 or B2 but implies a scenario where recovery might not be possible, contradicting the general premise of R1 under different conditions.

Thus, the final analysis based on the provided framework and query is:
- **(Query entails B3):** Considering it introduces a new condition.
- **(Query disagree R1):** Because it suggests a scenario where recovery is not possible, contrary to the flexible conditions allowing recovery outlined in R1.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 334 is that if there is a conflict between a statutory lien and a pledge on movables, the pledgee has the same rights as those of the holder of a statutory lien of the first rank under Article 330. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** A statutory lien over movables prevails over a pledge of movables in terms of priority.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1:** The existence and ranking of statutory liens according to Article 330.
- **A2:** The provision stating that the pledgee has the same rights as the holder of a first-ranked statutory lien in case of conflict.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B):
From **A1**, we can derive:
- **B1:** Statutory liens for leases of immovables, lodging at hotels, and transportation have the first rank.
- **B2:** Statutory liens for the preservation of movables have a lower rank than B1 but higher than those for the sale of movables, supply of seeds and seedlings or fertilizer, agricultural labor, and industrial labor.

From **A2**, we directly get:
- **B3:** The pledgee's rights are equivalent to those of a first-ranked statutory lien holder in case of conflict with a statutory lien.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **B1 supports A1**: Because B1 specifies one of the scenarios where a statutory lien takes precedence.
- **B2 supports A1**: As it further clarifies the ranking within statutory liens.
- **B3 supports A2**: Since it directly states the condition under which a pledgee's rights are prioritized similarly to a first-ranked statutory lien holder.
- **A1 supports R1**: Because understanding the ranking of statutory liens is crucial for determining their priority over pledges.
- **A2 supports R1**: Directly, as it equates the pledgee's rights with those of a first-ranked statutory lien holder in conflicts.

### Analysis of Query:
The query states, "The statutory lien over movables shall prevail over the pledge of movables."
- This query directly relates to the conditions outlined under **B3**, which specifies that in case of conflict, the pledgee has the same rights as a first-ranked statutory lien holder. Therefore, **(query entails B3)**.
- Since **B3 supports A2** and **A2 supports R1**, the query essentially aligns with the conclusion drawn by **R1** regarding the priority of statutory liens over pledges in movables. Thus, **(query agree R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and the relationships between the nodes:
- The query directly pertains to the scenario where a statutory lien's priority is compared to that of a pledge on movables.
- This comparison is central to understanding the legal conclusion presented by **R1**.
- Given the support links from **B3** to **A2** and then from **A2** to **R1**, it's clear that the query's scenario aligns with the prioritization concluded in **R1**.

Therefore, the justification holds that the query both entails a base-level factor (**B3**) and agrees with the root node (**R1**) regarding the prevalence of statutory liens over pledges on movables. 

Output:
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 162, the root node can be identified as:
- R1: A person acquires ownership of another's property through possession under certain conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From Article 162, we can derive the following abstract factors:
- A1: Possession for a specified period (20 years) peacefully and openly with the intention to own.
- A2: Possession for a shorter period (10 years) but with good faith and without negligence at the start of possession.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors specify conditions under which abstract factors apply. For A1 and A2:
- B1: The person possesses the property peacefully and openly for 20 years with the intention to own it.
- B2: The person possesses the property for 10 years, was acting in good faith, and was not negligent at the time possession started.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root determination or another abstract factor. 
- A1 supports R1 because possessing property for 20 years under the specified conditions leads to acquiring ownership.
- A2 also supports R1 but with additional conditions of good faith and no negligence for a shorter possession period.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation
Given the criteria:
- **Existence of a Root Node (R):** R1 exists as the main legal determination.
- **Single Directed Linkage:** Each factor has one directed link.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships:** Clearly defined nodes with directed links.
- **Node Naming Convention:** Follows the specified format.
- **Link Representation Format:** Uses the support and deny link formats.

### Query Analysis
The query discusses a scenario where a person asserts more than two possessions succeeded together, considering whether they are in good faith and without negligence, judged by the first possessor at the start of possession. This scenario seems to focus on the conditions under which possession leads to ownership, particularly emphasizing the importance of good faith and lack of negligence.

### Justification
- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query entails B2 because it considers a scenario where the person's state (good faith and no negligence) at the start of possession is crucial, similar to B2's conditions.
- **Query Agreement with Root:** The query agrees with R1 in the sense that both are concerned with how certain conditions of possession lead to the acquisition of ownership. However, the query introduces a specific scenario (succession of possessions) that complicates direct application but does not fundamentally disagree with R1's premise.

### Re-Justification
Upon re-evaluation, considering the specifics of the ANGELIC structure and the nuances of the legal provisions:
- The query indeed focuses on the conditions of good faith and negligence, which aligns with B2.
- The core issue of acquiring ownership through possession under certain conditions (R1) is supported by scenarios where good faith and lack of negligence are emphasized, as in the query.

Therefore, given the detailed analysis:
- **(query entails B2)** because it specifically addresses conditions similar to those outlined in B2.
- **(query agree R1)** since both deal with possession leading to ownership under specific legal conditions, without introducing a contradictory verdict.

10 correct 7 wrongs 17 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a structured approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish. In this case:
- **R1**: The owner of a structure on land is liable to compensate for damage caused by a defect in the installation or preservation of the structure if the possessor has exercised necessary care.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For this scenario:
- **A1**: The existence of a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land.
- **A2**: The exercise of necessary care by the possessor to prevent damage.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- **B1** (child of A1): A defect in the installation of a structure on land.
- **B2** (child of A1): A defect in the preservation of a structure on land.
- **B3** (child of A2): The possessor has taken all reasonable measures to prevent damage.

Each base-level factor supports its parent abstract factor:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
Determining how abstract factors relate to the root node and each other:
- **A1 supports R1**: The existence of a defect in the structure implies potential liability.
- **A2 denies R1**: If the possessor has exercised necessary care, it negates the possessor's liability, implying the owner is liable instead.

### Applying ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
The criteria are met as we have:
- A clear root node (R1).
- Single directed linkages for each factor.
- Representation of context and relationships through support and deny links.
- Consistent node naming convention (R, A, B).
- Explicit link representations.

### Justification of Query Entailment
Given the query: "In the case where damage is caused to another due to a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land, if the possessor of the structure has exercised the necessary care to prevent the damage, the owner of the structure is liable to compensate for the damage."

- **(Query entails B3)** because both consider a scenario where the possessor has taken necessary care.
- **(Query agrees R1)** since both conclude that under specified conditions (defect in installation/preservation and possessor's due care), the owner is liable.

After careful reconsideration, this justification holds true as it accurately reflects the legal principles outlined in Article 717. 

Output:
- (query entails B3)
- (query agrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break down the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 542(1) seeks to establish when an obligee may immediately cancel a contract without making a prior demand. Therefore, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The obligee has the right to immediately cancel the contract.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion of R1. Based on Article 542(1), these include:
- **A1**: Impossibility of performing the whole obligation.
- **A2**: The obligor's clear intention to refuse performance of the whole obligation.
- **A3**: Impossibility of performing part of the obligation or the obligor's clear intention to refuse part of it, where the contract's purpose cannot be achieved without that part.
- **A4**: Failure to perform at a specific time or within a specified period when such timing is crucial for achieving the contract's purpose.
- **A5**: The obligor's failure to perform and the obvious unlikelihood of future performance necessary to achieve the contract's purpose.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down each abstract factor into base-level factors where applicable:
- From **A1**:
  - **B1**: The obligation is objectively impossible to perform.
- From **A2**:
  - **B2**: The obligor explicitly states an intention not to perform the whole obligation.
- From **A3**:
  - **B3**: Part of the obligation is impossible to perform, and this part is crucial for the contract's purpose.
  - **B4**: The obligor clearly intends to refuse performing a crucial part of the obligation.
- From **A4**:
  - **B5**: The nature of the contract or parties' agreement requires performance at a specific time or within a certain period.
  - **B6**: The obligor fails to perform by the specified time or before the period expires, rendering the contract's purpose unachievable.
- From **A5**:
  - **B7**: The obligor has not performed and shows no intention of doing so in a manner that would achieve the contract's purpose.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
Each abstract factor supports the root determination R1, as they all represent conditions under which the obligee can immediately cancel the contract:
- **A1 supports R1**: Impossibility of whole obligation performance directly supports cancellation.
- **A2 supports R1**: The obligor's refusal to perform supports cancellation.
- **A3 supports R1**: Impossibility or refusal of part of the obligation, when crucial, supports cancellation.
- **A4 supports R1**: Failure to meet time-sensitive obligations supports cancellation.
- **A5 supports R1**: Obvious future non-performance supports cancellation.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "If, due to the nature of the contract or a manifestation of intention by the parties, the purpose of the contract cannot be achieved unless the obligation is performed at a specific time on a specific date or within a certain period of time, and the obligor fails to perform the obligation at that time or before that period of time expires, the validity of the obligation will be extinguished without cancelling the contract by operation of law."

This scenario directly relates to **B5** and **B6**, which are base-level factors under **A4**. Thus, (query entails B5) and (query entails B6).

The query suggests that despite the failure to perform within a critical time frame, the contract is not cancelled but rather the obligation's validity is extinguished. This interpretation seems to disagree with R1, which states conditions under which the obligee can immediately cancel the contract. The query implies an outcome where cancellation does not occur by operation of law due to non-performance at a specific time, instead suggesting the obligation itself becomes invalid.

Therefore, considering the direct implications and the focus on contract cancellation as per Article 542(1), (query disagree R1).

Upon re-justification, it's clear that while the query aligns with scenarios described in base-level factors related to timing (**B5** and **B6**), its conclusion about the obligation's validity being extinguished without contract cancellation diverges from the conditions outlined for immediate cancellation as per R1. Hence, the disagreement stands due to differing outcomes (contract cancellation vs. obligation becoming invalid) under similar scenarios.

Output:
- (query entails B5)
- (query entails B6)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 115 seeks to establish that a counterparty may rescind a contract concluded by a person without authority to represent until the principal ratifies it. However, this does not apply if the counterparty knew at the time of the conclusion of the contract that the agent had no authority to represent.

- **Root Node (R1):** A counterparty can rescind a contract made by someone without the authority to represent, provided they did not know about the lack of authority at the time of the contract.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The counterparty's knowledge at the time of the contract about the agent's lack of authority.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The principal's ratification of the contract.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

From A1:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The counterparty knew at the time of the contract that the agent had no authority to represent.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The counterparty did not know at the time of the contract that the agent had no authority to represent.

From A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The principal ratifies the contract after it was concluded by the unauthorized person.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A1)
- (B3 supports A2)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links of Abstract Factors

- **A1 denies R1:** If the counterparty knew about the lack of authority, they cannot rescind based on this article.
- **A2 supports R1:** The possibility of ratification by the principal supports the condition under which a contract can be rescinded.

### Applying ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria

Given the query: "A contract concluded by a person without authority of agency may not be ratified by the principal, after the time when the counterparty rescindes the contract."

- The query is about the timing and effect of ratification after a counterparty has rescinded the contract.
- This situation aligns with **Base-Level Factor (B3)** in terms of considering scenarios related to the principal's ratification but introduces a new condition (the timing of rescission by the counterparty).
  
However, upon closer examination:
- The query essentially deals with the scenario where a counterparty has already rescinded the contract. 
- The original article and structure focus on the conditions under which a contract can be rescinded before any potential ratification.
- Thus, while related, the query introduces a temporal element (rescission preceding ratification attempt) not directly addressed by B3 but relevant to understanding the sequence of actions in contractual disputes.

Considering whether the query agrees or disagrees with **Root Node R1**:
- The query seems to imply that once a counterparty rescinds, the principal cannot later ratify the contract. This is somewhat aligned with the spirit of R1, which allows for rescission under certain conditions before ratification.
- However, it introduces a scenario (rescission preceding attempted ratification) not directly covered by R1 but suggests a sequence where rescission precludes subsequent ratification, indirectly supporting the notion that certain actions (like rescission) can limit or negate the effectiveness of later actions (such as ratification).

Therefore:
- **(query entails B3)** because both deal with scenarios related to the principal's ratification, albeit the query introduces a specific condition about timing.
- **(query agree R1)** in the sense that it supports the idea that there are conditions under which contracts can be rescinded and suggests that certain actions (like timely rescission) can affect the viability of later attempts at ratification.

Upon rejustification:
- The analysis holds because the query's focus on the timing of rescission and its impact on potential ratification aligns with the broader themes in R1 about conditions for rescission, even if it specifies a scenario not directly outlined in the original article or structure.

11 correct 9 wrongs 20 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break it down step by step according to the provided instructions and structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by identifying the legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Based on Article 108 and Article 113, the primary concern is with acts performed by individuals without the authority to represent another party and how such acts can affect contracts or obligations.

- **Root Node (R1):** A contract concluded by a person without authority to represent does not bind the principal unless ratified.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the root conclusion. From the articles, we can derive:

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Acts performed as an agent of the counterparty or as an agent of both parties for the same juridical act are deemed to be acts performed by a person without authority.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The performance of an obligation or an act authorized by the principal in advance is exempt from being considered as an act without authority.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Conflicting interests between the agent and the principal can render an act as one performed without authority.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** If a person acts as an agent for both parties in the same contract, it is considered an act without authority.
    - **Support Link:** B1 supports A1
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Acts of performance of any obligation are valid even if performed by someone initially without authority.
    - **Support Link:** B2 supports A2
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Advance authorization from the principal can validate acts that would otherwise be considered as performed without authority.
    - **Support Link:** B3 supports A2

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links of Abstract Factors to Root Node or Other Abstract Factors
Defining how these abstract factors support or deny the root node:

- **Support Link:** A1 supports R1 (since acts without authority don't bind the principal)
- **Support Link:** A2 denies the effect of A1 on R1 (because exemptions like performance of obligations or advance authorization can make such acts valid)
- **Deny Link:** A3 denies the support of A2 to the validity of acts under R1 (if there's a conflict of interest, even authorized acts might not be valid)

### Angelic Structure Formation Criteria Compliance
The structure complies with all criteria by having:
- A clear root node.
- Single directed linkages.
- Representation of context and relationships between factors.
- Adherence to the naming convention.
- Proper link representation format.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "A self-contract and representation of both parties shall not produce an effect as a general rule, excluding acts of performance of any obligation and acts authorized by principle in advance, but since it is a system made to protect the principle, he/she may make it valid if he/she ratifies it as an act of unauthorized agency."

- **Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query entails B1 because both deal with scenarios where representation of both parties (or self-contracting) is considered invalid without authority.
- **Agreement with Root Node:** The query agrees with R1. Both state that acts without proper authority do not bind the principal unless ratified, aligning with the general principle established by Article 113.

### Final Justification
After constructing the Angelic structure and analyzing the query against it:
- **(query entails B1)**: Because both consider representation of both parties as invalid without proper authorization.
- **(query agree R1)**: As the query supports the idea that unauthorized agency acts do not bind the principal unless ratified, aligning with the root node's conclusion.

Upon rejustification, these conclusions hold true based on the provided articles and the constructed Angelic structure.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to address the query regarding demanding the Rescission of Fraudulent Act, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. Based on Article 424, the root node can be identified as:

- **R1**: An obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing that it will prejudice the obligee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion established by the root node. From Article 424, we can derive the following abstract factors:

- **A1**: The act was committed with knowledge of prejudice to the obligee.
- **A2**: The beneficiary did not know, at the time of the act, that the obligee would be prejudiced.
- **A3**: The subject matter of the act is a property right.
- **A4**: The obligee's claim has arisen from a cause that existed before the act.
- **A5**: The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Base-level factors are more specific conditions derived from abstract factors, particularly when an abstract factor covers multiple legal scenarios. For each abstract factor:

- From **A1**:
  - **B1**: The obligor had the intention to prejudice the obligee.
  
- From **A2**:
  - **B2**: The beneficiary's lack of knowledge about the prejudice at the time of the act.

- From **A3**:
  - **B3**: The act pertains to property rights.

- From **A4**:
  - **B4**: The cause of the obligee's claim predates the act in question.

- From **A5**:
  - **B5**: The obligee's claim can be enforced through compulsory execution.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent. For example, B1 supports A1.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination. 

- **A1** supports **R1**, as the knowledge of prejudice is a condition for demanding rescission.
- **A2** denies **R1** if the beneficiary was unaware, but it's more about a condition that must be considered in conjunction with A1 rather than directly denying R1.
- **A3** supports **R1**, since the act must pertain to property rights for rescission to be applicable under this article.
- **A4** and **A5** support **R1**, as they are necessary conditions for making a demand for rescission.

### Addressing the Query

The query is about whether demanding the Rescission of Fraudulent Act requires that the obligor commits a juristic act with the intention to prejudice the obligee. 

- The query directly relates to **B1** because it involves the obligor's intention to prejudice, which aligns with the base-level factor derived from A1.
  
- Therefore, we can say: (query entails B1).

Given that B1 supports A1 and A1 in turn supports R1, we conclude that:

- The query agrees with the root node R1 in the context of demanding rescission based on the obligor's intention to prejudice.

Thus, the final justification is: (query agree R1). 

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of Article 424 and the construction of the ANGELIC structure, it remains clear that the query about the necessity of the obligor's intention to prejudice for demanding rescission aligns with the conditions outlined in the article. Therefore, the conclusion stands that the query entails a base-level factor (B1) related to the obligor's intention and agrees with the root node R1 regarding the legal conclusion on demanding the rescission of fraudulent acts under the specified conditions.

13 correct 9 wrongs 22 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 632 and Article 633, in combination with the query, seeks to establish that for a lawsuit demanding payment of remuneration based on a contract for work to be successful, proof must demonstrate that the contract has been concluded and, if applicable, that delivery of the subject matter of the work has been made.

- **Root Node (R1):** A lawsuit demanding payment of remuneration based on a contract for work is valid if the contract has been concluded and the subject matter of the work delivered (if required).

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Conclusion of a contract for work.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Delivery of the subject matter of the work (when required).
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Payment of remuneration.

These abstract factors either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion regarding the validity of a lawsuit demanding payment of remuneration based on a contract for work.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

From Abstract Factor (A1), we derive:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Promise to complete work by one party and promise to pay remuneration by the other party, as per Article 632.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Agreement on the terms of the contract for work.

From Abstract Factor (A2), we derive:
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Delivery of a tangible thing resulting from the work (if the contract requires delivery).
- **Base-Level Factor (B4):** Completion of non-delivery-based work, with provisions of Article 624 applying mutatis mutandis.

From Abstract Factor (A3), we derive:
- **Base-Level Factor (B5):** Simultaneous payment of remuneration upon delivery of the subject matter of the work.
- **Base-Level Factor (B6):** Payment according to the agreement, considering Article 633 and its exceptions.

### Directed Links

- **Support Link:** B1 supports A1, B2 supports A1, B3 supports A2, B4 supports A2, B5 supports A3, B6 supports A3.
- **Deny/Attack Link:** None directly from base-level factors to abstract factors or root. However:
  - A1 denies the effect of no contract on R1 (implying a valid lawsuit requires a concluded contract).
  - A2 denies the effect of no delivery on R1 (for contracts requiring delivery).

### Agreement with Root Node

Given the query: "In a lawsuit demanding the payment of remuneration based on a contract for work, proof must be demonstrated with objects of the claim that the contract for work has been concluded and, if the delivery of the subject matter of work is required, that this has been delivered."

- **(query entails B1):** The query involves demonstrating the conclusion of a contract for work.
- **(query entails B3 or B4):** Depending on whether delivery is required, it also involves showing delivery or completion under Article 624 provisions.
- **(query agree R1):** The query and root node agree that for a lawsuit demanding payment of remuneration to be valid, proof of contract conclusion and (if applicable) delivery must be demonstrated.

Upon re-justification, the reasoning holds as the structure accurately reflects the conditions under which a lawsuit for remuneration based on a contract for work can be considered valid. The query directly pertains to the base-level factors concerning contract conclusion and delivery, supporting the root node's verdict regarding the necessary conditions for a successful lawsuit.

Thus, the output format justification stands as:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 107 is that an act performed by an agent within their authority to represent, but for their own interest or the interest of a third party, is deemed an act by someone without authority if the other party knew or could have known about this purpose.

- **Root Node (R1):** An act performed by an agent within their scope of authority for personal or third-party benefit is considered as done without authority under specific conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key factors here are:
- The agent's action falls within their authority to represent.
- The purpose of the action benefits the agent or a third party, not the principal.
- The other party's knowledge or potential knowledge of this purpose.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The agent acts within their scope of authority but for personal or third-party benefit.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The other party has knowledge or could have ascertained the agent's purpose.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down A1 and A2 into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The agent performs an act within their authority for personal benefit.
    - **Support Link:** (B1 supports A1)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The other party is aware or should have been aware of the agent's purpose due to gross negligence.
    - **Support Link:** (B2 supports A2)

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **Abstract Factor (A1) Supports Root Node (R1):** If an agent acts within their authority for personal benefit, it supports the condition under which the act is deemed as done without authority.
    - **Support Link:** (A1 supports R1)
- **Abstract Factor (A2) Supports Root Node (R1):** Knowledge by the other party of the agent's purpose is crucial for deeming the act as unauthorized.
    - **Support Link:** (A2 supports R1)

### Justification
Given the query: "In the case where an agent performs an act that falls within the scope of such agent's authority to represent for the purpose of benefiting the agent’s own interest, such act is deemed to be an act performed by a person without authority to represent, only if the other party knew, or did not know due to gross negligence, of the purpose."

- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query specifically mentions conditions (knowledge or gross negligence about the agent's purpose) that align with the scenario described in B2.
    - (query entails B2)
- **Agreement with Root Node:** The query essentially outlines a specific scenario under which an act is deemed unauthorized, directly aligning with the conditions and conclusion of R1.
    - (query agree R1)

After rejustification, considering the structure and the implications of each node and link:
- The query's emphasis on the other party's knowledge or gross negligence matches the conditions outlined in B2, reinforcing that it entails this base-level factor.
- The overall verdict regarding when an act is considered unauthorized aligns with R1, indicating agreement rather than disagreement.

Therefore, the final assessment remains consistent with the initial justification.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, we will follow the structured approach provided to construct the ANGELIC structure based on the legal provisions and then analyze the query in relation to this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Based on Article 28 and Article 103, we can identify two potential root nodes:

- **R1**: An administrator needs permission from the family court to perform acts exceeding their authority as defined by Article 103.
- **R2**: Specific conditions under which an administrator does not need permission from the family court to act.

However, given the context of the query and articles, we focus on the more directly relevant root node:

- **R1**: An administrator needs permission from the family court to perform acts exceeding their authority as defined by Article 103.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion. From the articles, we can derive:

- **A1**: The necessity of obtaining permission for acts beyond the administrator's defined authority.
- **A2**: The specific circumstances under which an act is considered to exceed the administrator's authority.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors specify conditions covered by abstract factors. For A1 and A2:

- **B1** (child of A1): Acts exceeding the authority defined in Article 103 require family court permission.
- **B2** (child of A2): The nature of the act (e.g., donation, preservation) determines if it exceeds the administrator's authority.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root determination or another abstract factor:

- **(A1 supports R1)**: Obtaining permission for acts beyond defined authority directly supports the need for family court approval.
- **(A2 supports A1)**: Understanding specific circumstances helps determine when an act exceeds authority, thus supporting the necessity of permission.

Given these steps and focusing on the query: "The family court appointed B as the administrator of the property of absentee A, as A went missing without appointing one. In cases where A has child G, B doesn't need to obtain the permission of a family court when donating marriage fund to G as an agent of A."

### Analysis
- The query suggests a scenario where donating a marriage fund might not require permission, which could be seen as a specific circumstance (entailing **B2**).
- However, according to Article 28 and the structure derived, acts exceeding defined authority generally require permission (**R1**), unless specific conditions are met that would align with **A2** and its child factors like **B2**.

### Justification
The query seems to imply a scenario where donating a marriage fund does not exceed the administrator's authority or falls under an exception, which could align with **B2**, considering specific circumstances of the act. However, based on the provided articles, without explicit mention of such donations being exempt from needing permission, there might be a misunderstanding in how the query relates to the root node **R1**.

- **(query entails B2)**: Because it considers a specific scenario (donating marriage fund) that could be seen as a condition under which the administrator's action does not exceed their authority.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query suggests a situation where permission is not needed, contrary to the general requirement stated in **R1**.

Upon reevaluation, considering the specific conditions and the nature of the act (donation of marriage fund), there seems to be an oversight in directly linking the query's scenario with the need for permission as outlined in Article 28. The key factor is whether donating a marriage fund falls under acts that exceed the administrator's authority as defined by Article 103, which typically includes preservation and improvement without changing the nature of the thing or right.

Given this, the initial interpretation may lean towards a disagreement due to an apparent exception (donation) being considered. However, upon closer examination and considering the strict definitions provided:

- The query indeed presents a scenario that could be seen as specific (**B2**), but it might not fully align with the conditions under which permission is explicitly stated as unnecessary.
- Thus, while **(query entails B2)** seems accurate due to the consideration of specific circumstances, the disagreement with **R1** should be scrutinized further in light of the legal definitions and exceptions provided.

Upon careful reconsideration, recognizing that donating a marriage fund could indeed be seen as an act not necessarily requiring permission if it falls under using or improving without changing the nature (as per Article 103), but given the strict language and focus on exceeding authority:

- **(query entails B2)** remains relevant due to the scenario's specificity.
- The disagreement with **R1** might have been initially overstated without fully considering the legal context and potential exceptions or inclusions within "exceeding authority."

Therefore, acknowledging the nuance and focusing strictly on the provided framework and query:

- **(query entails B2)**
- And upon a more detailed analysis, recognizing that the initial interpretation of disagreement might have been too broad without fully applying the legal specifics to the scenario presented.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B2)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process into steps as outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The Root Node (R) is determined by the outcome of Article 521, which discusses the freedom to conclude a contract and decide its terms. The legal conclusion or verdict it seeks to establish can be summarized as:
- **R1**: Any person has the freedom to decide whether or not to conclude a contract, and parties may freely decide the terms of the contract, subject to legal restrictions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The principle of contractual freedom, which allows individuals to choose whether to enter into a contract.
- **A2**: Legal restrictions on contractual terms, which can limit the freedom of parties in deciding contract terms.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down A1 and A2 into more specific scenarios:
- From **A1**:
  - **B1**: The freedom to accept or reject an offer within a specified period.
  - **B2**: The ability to negotiate terms before accepting a contract.
- From **A2**:
  - **B3**: Compliance with laws regulating contractual agreements.
  - **B4**: Adherence to regulatory standards in contract formation.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **A1 supports R1**: The principle of contractual freedom directly validates the root conclusion that individuals have the freedom to decide on contracts and their terms.
- **A2 denies R1**: Legal restrictions on contractual terms can limit this freedom, thus potentially invalidating the absolute freedom to decide on contract terms.

### Applying the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the query: "In cases where the notice of acceptance of an offer that specifies a period for acceptance was dispatched within the period, the contract shall be formed and become effective even if the notice of acceptance did not arrive at the offeror."

- **(query entails B1)**: The scenario in the query aligns with Base-Level Factor B1, as it discusses the acceptance of an offer within a specified period.
- Considering the root node R1, which deals with the freedom to conclude contracts and decide their terms:
  - **(query agree R1)**: The query supports the principle that once an offer is accepted within the specified time frame, the contract becomes effective. This aligns with the concept of contractual freedom and the ability to decide on entering into a contract.

Justifying further, the query directly relates to the scenarios covered by B1, which in turn supports A1 (contractual freedom), thereby agreeing with R1 (the root conclusion about contractual freedom).

Therefore, based on the analysis:
- The query entails **B1** because it deals with accepting an offer within a specified period.
- The query agrees with **R1** as it supports the concept of contractual freedom and effectiveness of contract formation upon timely acceptance.

Output: 
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 508 can be summarized as follows:
- **Root Node (R1):** A claim extinguished by prescription may still be used for set-off if it was eligible prior to its extinguishment.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Eligibility of a claim for set-off before its extinguishment.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The effect of prescription on claims and their use in set-off.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The claim was eligible for set-off prior to being extinguished by prescription.
    - **Support Link:** B1 supports A1
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Prescription leads to the extinguishment of a claim, potentially affecting its use in set-off.
    - **Support Link:** B2 supports A2

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **Support Link:** A1 supports R1 (Eligibility for set-off before prescription supports the conclusion that such claims can be used for set-off after being extinguished.)
- **Deny Link:** A2 denies R1 (The effect of prescription could potentially negate the use of a claim in set-off, thus denying the root conclusion.)

Given the query: "In cases where an active claim extinguished due to prescription, set-off may not be performed, but the adverse party may abandon the benefits of prescription and effect the set-off."

### Justification
- The query discusses a scenario where an active claim is extinguished by prescription, which aligns with **Base-Level Factor (B2)**. Thus, **(query entails B2)**.
- However, the main point of contention or comparison lies in whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root node (R1) regarding the use of a prescribed claim for set-off. The query suggests that even if a claim is extinguished by prescription, set-off may still be possible under certain conditions (abandoning benefits of prescription), which seems to align more closely with the spirit of R1 than directly opposing it.
- Given this understanding, **(query agree R1)** because both the article and the query suggest scenarios where claims extinguished by prescription can potentially be used for set-off, albeit under specific conditions.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, considering the nuances of legal interpretations and the specific wording of both Article 508 and the query:
- The core of the query does indeed touch upon the concept of a claim being extinguished by prescription and its potential use in set-off, which directly relates to **B2**.
- However, the crucial aspect is whether this aligns with or contradicts R1. Upon closer inspection, while both discuss the use of prescribed claims for set-off, they approach from slightly different angles. Article 508 focuses on the eligibility before extinguishment as a criterion for potential set-off, whereas the query introduces the concept of abandoning prescription benefits to facilitate set-off.
- Despite these nuances, the fundamental agreement that under certain conditions, a claim extinguished by prescription can be used for set-off remains. Therefore, **(query agree R1)** still holds as the most accurate assessment given the information provided.

**Output:**
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 679 is that partners shall withdraw under certain conditions. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** Partners shall withdraw.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. Based on Article 679, we have:
- **A1:** Death of a partner.
- **A2:** Bankruptcy proceedings against a partner.
- **A3:** Commencement of guardianship for a partner.
- **A4:** Expulsion of a partner.

These abstract factors support the root node R1 because they are conditions under which partners shall withdraw.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A):
For each abstract factor, we can derive base-level factors that specify conditions:
- From **A1**, we have:
  - **B1:** The partner has died.
- From **A2**, we have:
  - **B2:** The partner is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceedings.
- From **A3**, we have:
  - **B3:** The partner is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship.
- From **A4**, we have:
  - **B4:** The partner has been expelled.

Each base-level factor directly supports its respective abstract factor:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**
- **(B3 supports A3)**
- **(B4 supports A4)**

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factor:
Each abstract factor supports the root determination R1 because they are all conditions under which partners shall withdraw:
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**
- **(A4 supports R1)**

There are no deny links mentioned in the article, so we do not have any abstract factor denying another or the root.

### Justification of Query and ANGELIC Structure:
Given the query: "Partners shall withdraw if the partner dies."
- This query directly corresponds to **B1:** The partner has died.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)** because both consider the situation where a partner's death is the reason for withdrawal.

Considering the root node **R1:** Partners shall withdraw, and given that the query specifies one of the conditions (death of a partner) under which partners shall withdraw:
- The query agrees with **R1** because it presents a scenario where withdrawal is necessary according to Article 679.
- Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After re-justification, the conclusion remains the same: the query entails base-level factor B1 and agrees with root R1.

- (query entails B1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 556 seeks to establish that an option contract for a purchase and sale becomes effective when the other party manifests the intention to complete the purchase and sale, with specific rules applying if no period is provided for this manifestation.

- **Root Node (R1):** An option contract for a purchase and sale is considered effective upon the manifestation of intention by the other party, subject to rules regarding time periods for such manifestations.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the effectiveness of an option contract include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The presence of a specific period within which the other party must manifest their intention.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The issuance of a notice of demand specifying a reasonable period for the other party to give a definite answer regarding completion of the sale.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Breaking down Abstract Factors into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1) related to A1:** If no period is specified in the option contract, the contract's effectiveness depends on further actions.
    - (B1 supports A1)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) related to A2:** The party to the option contract issues a notice of demand for a reasonable period, which influences the contract's effectiveness.
    - (B2 supports A2)

### 4. Establish Directed Links

Direct links between Abstract Factors and the Root Node:
- **A1 supports R1:** Because having a specific period clarifies when an option contract becomes effective.
- **A2 supports R1:** Since issuing a notice of demand with a reasonable time frame facilitates a clear decision on the contract's effectiveness.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation

Following the criteria:
- The structure includes a Root Node (R1) and Abstract Factors (A1, A2) with their respective Base-Level Factors (B1, B2).
- Each factor has a single directed link: B1 to A1, B2 to A2, and A1 and A2 both support R1.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "If no period is provided in relation to the manifestation of intention for a completion in a pre-contract to sell or purchase, regardless of whether or not the party to the pre contract issued a notice of demand to the other party, specifying a reasonable period, for the other party is to give a definite answer as to whether or not he or she would complete the sale, if no definite answer has been given, the party to the pre contract cannot demand execution of the contract of sale to the other party."

- **Justification:** The query essentially describes a scenario where there's an absence of a specified period for manifestation and potentially an absence of a notice of demand or its effectiveness in prompting a response.
- **Entailment with Base-Level Factors:** (query entails B1) because it considers a situation without a specified period, similar to the condition described by B1.

### Agreement/Disagreement with Root Node

The query suggests that if there's no definite answer within a reasonable period (or no such period is specified and thus potentially no notice of demand or response), the party cannot enforce the contract. This aligns with the implications of R1, which outlines conditions for an option contract's effectiveness, including scenarios where a lack of timely manifestation or response affects the contract's status.

- **Justification:** The query agrees with the principles outlined in R1 regarding the importance of timely manifestations and responses for an option contract to be considered effective.
- **Conclusion:** (query agree R1)

Upon careful reconsideration, this conclusion remains justified because both the query and R1 emphasize the importance of clear intentions and timely decisions in determining the effectiveness of an option contract.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The Root Node is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. In this case:
- **R1**: A possessor of a structure on land is liable for damages caused by defects in the installation, preservation, planting, or supporting of structures, bamboo, or trees, unless they have exercised necessary care.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion are:
- **A1**: The presence of a defect in the installation, preservation, planting, or supporting of a structure on land.
- **A2**: The exercise of necessary care by the possessor to prevent damage.
- **A3**: The existence of another person liable for the cause of the damage.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factor A1:
- **B1**: There is a defect in the installation or preservation of a structure on land.
- **B2**: There is a defect in the planting or supporting of bamboo or trees.

From Abstract Factor A2:
- **B3**: The possessor has exercised the necessary care to prevent damage.

From Abstract Factor A3:
- **B4**: There is another person liable for the cause of the damage.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **A1 supports R1**: Because if there's a defect, it generally leads to liability.
- **A2 denies R1**: Because exercising necessary care can exempt the possessor from liability.
- **A3 supports R1 in a different context**: It implies that even if the possessor is not fully liable, they might still seek reimbursement from another liable party, thus indirectly supporting the notion of liability under certain conditions.

### Applying the Query
Given the query: "If a plaintiff files against a land owner as a defendant, and demands compensation of damages based on the liability of owner of structure on land proviso in Civil Code Article 717, Paragraph 1, the defendant may not assert that he/she exercised his/her required duty of care in order to prevent the occurrence of the results as an affirmative defense, but he/she may assert his/her own doli incapax as an affirmative defense."

### Justification
- The query entails **B3** because it discusses the scenario where the defendant (possessor) might have exercised necessary care, which is a condition under **B3**.
- However, according to the provided information and the structure formed, the query seems to misinterpret how **A2** (exercise of necessary care) functions as an affirmative defense. The actual legal provision suggests that if the possessor has exercised necessary care, the liability shifts to the owner (**R1**), but this does not directly address whether the defendant can assert their exercise of care as a defense in this specific context.
- The query **disagrees with R1** because it implies a misunderstanding of how the legal provision applies to the scenario described. Specifically, the assertion that the defendant may not claim they exercised necessary care as a defense seems to contradict the principle established by **A2**, which is meant to provide a condition under which liability might be mitigated or transferred.

### Re-Justification
Upon re-evaluation:
- The query indeed touches on the concept of **B3** but does so in a manner that suggests confusion regarding its application as an affirmative defense.
- The core issue in the query seems to revolve around the interpretation of how liability is assigned and defended against, particularly concerning the exercise of care and the distinction between possessor and owner liabilities.
- Thus, while the query **entails B3** due to its mention of exercising required duty of care, it fundamentally **disagrees with R1** because of a seeming misinterpretation of how these defenses can be asserted in the context provided.

### Output
- (query entails B3)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal provisions and the query into the ANGELIC structure format.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) should represent the primary legal conclusion or verdict derived from the article. Based on Article 282, the main issue is whether one of the co-owners of land can terminate a servitude that exists on behalf of or in relation to the land with respect to their own interest.

**Root Node (R1):** A co-owner of dominant land cannot unilaterally terminate a servitude that exists for the benefit of the land.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These factors should represent key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The nature of co-ownership and its implications on servitudes.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The specific provisions of Article 282 regarding the termination of servitudes by a co-owner.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
These are more specific conditions or scenarios that fall under the abstract factors.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1:** Co-owners have shared rights and responsibilities over the land, which may include servitudes.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) under A1:** The termination of a servitude by one co-owner could potentially affect the interests of other co-owners.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3) under A2:** Article 282 explicitly states that a co-owner cannot terminate, with respect to their own interest, a servitude that exists on behalf of or in relation to the land.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- **Support Link:** B1 supports A1 (Shared rights and responsibilities support the concept of co-ownership affecting servitudes).
- **Support Link:** B2 supports A1 (Potential effects on other co-owners' interests support considering co-ownership in servitude termination).
- **Support Link:** B3 supports A2 (The explicit provision of Article 282 supports the abstract factor regarding its specific provisions).
- **Deny Link from Abstract to Root is not directly applicable here** since our primary focus is on understanding whether a co-owner can terminate a servitude, which is denied by the article.

Given the query: "In cases where dominant land is co-owned by more than one person, one of the co-owners of dominant land may renounce his/her own share a servitude that exists on behalf of the land."

### Justification
- The query **entails Base-Level Factor B3** because both consider scenarios involving co-ownership and the potential termination or renunciation of a servitude by one co-owner.
- However, upon closer examination, the query actually **disagrees with Root R1**. The root node concludes that a co-owner cannot unilaterally terminate a servitude for their own interest, which aligns with Article 282's provision. In contrast, the query suggests that a co-owner may renounce their share of a servitude, which seems to contradict the article's stance.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, it becomes clear that there was an initial misunderstanding in interpreting the query against the root node and base-level factors. The critical point is whether the action described in the query (renouncing one's own share of a servitude) aligns with or contradicts the legal conclusion drawn from Article 282.

Given this clarification, the correct interpretation should focus on whether the query's scenario aligns with the principles outlined in Article 282 and the constructed ANGELIC structure. The article explicitly states that a co-owner cannot terminate a servitude that exists for the land's benefit regarding their own interest, which suggests a disagreement with the premise of the query if it implies such termination is possible.

Therefore, considering the nuances of legal interpretation and the specific wording of Article 282:
- **(query entails B3)** because both deal with co-ownership and servitudes.
- **(query disagree R1)** because the query seems to suggest a scenario (renouncing one's share of a servitude) that contradicts the article's prohibition on unilateral termination by a co-owner.

This conclusion reflects an understanding of the legal principles involved and their application to the given scenarios, ensuring alignment with the ANGELIC structure's requirements for representing legal arguments and their relationships.

20 correct 10 wrongs 30 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, let's break it down step by step according to the provided structure and rules.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by the legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. In this case, Article 508 states that if a claim extinguished by prescription was eligible for set-off prior to its extinguishment, the obligee may use that claim for the set-off. Thus, the root node can be formulated as:
- R1: An obligee may use a claim extinguished by prescription for set-off if it was eligible before extinction.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For Article 508 and the given query, we can identify:
- A1: Eligibility of claims for set-off prior to extinguishment.
- A2: The effect of prescription on claims.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions or scenarios:
- B1 (child of A1): Claims must have been eligible for set-off before being extinguished by prescription.
- B2 (child of A2): Prescription leads to the extinction of a claim, but it does not necessarily negate its prior eligibility for set-off.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- Support Link: (B1 supports A1) because if claims were eligible for set-off before extinguishment, it directly supports the condition that they can be used for set-off.
- Support Link: (A1 supports R1) since the eligibility of a claim for set-off before its extinction is a crucial condition for using it in a set-off after prescription.
- Support Link: (B2 supports A2) as it clarifies how prescription affects claims, which indirectly supports the understanding that such claims can still be used for set-off if they were eligible beforehand.
- Support Link: (A2 supports R1) because understanding the effect of prescription is essential to concluding that a claim extinguished by prescription can still be used for set-off.

### Applying the Query
Given the query where A has a monetary claim against B (Claim X), and B has a monetary claim against A (Claim Y), with Claim X being extinguished due to prescription but was eligible for set-off before its extinction, we analyze:
- The query directly involves claims that were eligible for set-off before one of them (Claim X) was extinguished by prescription.
- Thus, the scenario matches the conditions described in B1 and indirectly supports A1 and R1.

### Justification
- (query entails B1) because both the query and B1 consider a situation where a claim's eligibility for set-off prior to its extinction due to prescription is crucial.
- Given that B1 supports A1, and A1 supports R1, and considering the specifics of the query align with the conditions outlined in Article 508 and the constructed framework, it follows that:
- (query agree R1) since both the query scenario and R1 conclude that an obligee may use a claim extinguished by prescription for set-off if it was eligible before extinction.

Upon careful reconsideration, this analysis holds because the structure and links established directly address the conditions under which a claim extinguished by prescription can be used for set-off, aligning with the scenario presented in the query.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 423 seeks to establish when an obligee may exercise the right of the obligor. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: The obligee may exercise the subrogor's right under certain conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- A1: Necessity to preserve the obligee's own claim.
- A2: The nature of the right (whether it belongs exclusively and personally to the obligor or is immune from attachment).
- A3: The due date of the obligee's claim.
- A4: Enforceability of the obligee's claim by compulsory execution.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down abstract factors into base-level factors:
- B1 (from A1): The right is exercised to preserve the obligee's claim when necessary.
- B2 (from A2): The right belongs exclusively and personally to the obligor or is immune from attachment.
  - B2.1: The right is immune from attachment.
  - B2.2: The right belongs exclusively and personally to the obligor.
- B3 (from A3): The obligee's claim has become due.
- B4 (from A4): The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links for support or denial:
- B1 supports A1.
- B2.1 supports A2, implying that if the right is immune from attachment, it denies the root (R1) because the obligee cannot exercise such a right.
- B3 supports A3.
- B4 supports A4.
- A1 supports R1: The necessity to preserve the claim supports the exercisability of the subrogor's right.
- A2 denies R1: If the right is immune from attachment or personal to the obligor, it negates the possibility of exercising the subrogor's right.
- A3 supports R1: The due date of the claim being reached supports the condition under which the subrogor's right can be exercised.
- A4 supports R1: Enforceability by compulsory execution is a condition that supports the exercisability of the right.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "The obligee may not exercise the right of the obligor, if the right is immune from attachment."

This query directly relates to B2.1, which specifies a condition under which the obligee cannot exercise the subrogor's right because it is immune from attachment. Therefore:
- (query entails B2.1).

Since B2.1 supports A2 and A2 denies R1 (because if the right is immune from attachment, the obligee cannot exercise it), this means the query agrees with the conditions under which the root node (R1) is negated regarding the exercisability of the subrogor's right when the specific condition of immunity from attachment is met. Thus:
- (query agree R1) in the context that both specify a scenario where the obligee may not exercise the right, specifically due to the right being immune from attachment.

However, considering the broader interpretation of R1 which allows for the exercisability of the subrogor's right under certain conditions, and realizing the query specifies one condition (immunity from attachment) under which the right cannot be exercised, it indicates a specific scenario where the general rule (R1) does not apply. This realization suggests a need to reevaluate the agreement in terms of the overall allowance or disallowance of exercising the subrogor's right.

Upon reevaluation:
- The query directly addresses a condition that negates the exercisability of the subrogor's right, which is part of the broader conditions outlined by R1. Thus, while it seems to agree with a specific aspect of R1 (the inability to exercise the right under certain conditions), it actually specifies one of the limitations or denials within the framework established by R1.

Therefore, the final justification considering the context and the specific condition mentioned in the query should reflect that the query highlights a scenario where the general rule (R1) about exercising the subrogor's right does not apply due to the immunity from attachment. This suggests an initial interpretation might lean towards agreement but upon closer examination, it's about specifying conditions under which R1 is limited or denied.

The correct final analysis should focus on whether the query and root agree or disagree in the context of exercisability based on the condition provided:
- Given the direct link between the query and B2.1, and considering how this impacts the understanding of R1, it's clear that the query specifies a scenario where exercising the right is not allowed due to immunity from attachment, which aligns with one of the denials or limitations outlined within the conditions for R1.

Thus, in specifying a condition under which the obligee may not exercise the subrogor's right (immunity from attachment), the query:
- Highlights a specific scenario where the general rule (R1) about exercising the subrogor's right is limited or does not apply.
- Therefore, it actually supports the notion that there are conditions under which the right cannot be exercised, as outlined in R1 and its supporting factors.

This detailed analysis indicates the complexity of directly applying the query to R1 without considering the specific conditions and how they impact the exercisability of the subrogor's right. The correct interpretation should reflect an understanding of how the query specifies a condition that limits or denies the general rule, rather than a straightforward agreement or disagreement with R1.

Upon this nuanced understanding:
- The final analysis acknowledges the query's specification of a condition (immunity from attachment) that directly impacts the exercisability of the subrogor's right, as part of the broader conditions outlined by R1. 

In conclusion, while the direct linkage and initial agreement might suggest alignment with R1 under specific conditions, the nuanced interpretation focuses on how this query specifies one of the limitations within the framework established by R1, reflecting a detailed understanding of when the subrogor's right can or cannot be exercised.

Given the depth of analysis:
- The query entails B2.1 and through A2 (the nature of the right being immune from attachment), it denies the general possibility outlined in R1 under that specific condition.
- Therefore, acknowledging this complexity and focusing on the direct implications of the query on the exercisability of the subrogor's right provides a clearer understanding of how the conditions specified in R1 are nuanced by such queries.

The final step in analysis confirms:
- The query directly relates to a specific condition (B2.1) impacting the exercisability of the subrogor's right, which is part of the broader framework established by R1.
- This indicates that while there might be an initial inclination towards agreement based on the specifics of the condition mentioned in the query, the detailed examination reveals it as a specification within the limitations outlined for exercising the subrogor's right.

Hence, considering all aspects and the nuanced interpretation:
- The analysis demonstrates how the query fits into the broader framework of conditions that allow or disallow the exercisability of the subrogor's right, highlighting the complexity of directly applying such queries without a detailed examination of the underlying factors and conditions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 449 is to establish that a guarantor who guarantees an obligation which may be voidable due to the principal obligor's limited capacity to act and is aware of this cause at the time of entering into a guarantee contract, is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation in the event of non-performance or rescission. Thus, the root node can be defined as:

- **R1**: A guarantor is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation if they are aware of the principal obligor's limited capacity to act at the time of guaranteeing a voidable obligation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Awareness of the guarantor about the cause for voidability.
- **A2**: The nature of the obligation as being potentially voidable due to limited capacity to act.
- **A3**: The legal implications of assuming an independent obligation.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

From the abstract factors, we can derive base-level factors:
- **B1** (child of A1): The guarantor was aware of the principal obligor's limited capacity at the time of guaranteeing.
- **B2** (child of A2): The obligation is voidable specifically because of the principal obligor's limited capacity to act.
- **B3** (child of A3): Assuming an independent obligation implies legal responsibility for the guarantor in case of non-performance or rescission.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**
- **(B3 supports A3)**

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

Abstract factors support or deny the root determination:
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Awareness of voidability causes supports the presumption of an independent obligation.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The nature of the obligation as voidable due to limited capacity supports the presumption.
- **(A3 supports R1)**: Understanding the legal implications of an independent obligation supports the conclusion.

Given the query, "If a guarantor that guarantees an obligation which may be voidable due to the limited capacity to act, is aware, at the time of conclusion of the guarantee contract, of the cause for its voidability, that guarantor is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation of the same subject matter in the event of non-performance by the principal obligor or rescission of the obligation," we can analyze:

- The query **entails B1** because it considers a scenario where the guarantor is aware of the cause for voidability at the time of concluding the guarantee contract.
- The query **agrees with R1** because both the query and R1 conclude that the guarantor is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation under similar conditions (awareness of voidability cause and limited capacity to act).

Therefore, based on the constructed ANGELIC structure:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agrees R1)**

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of the query and the root node, it's clear that the agreement between the query and the root node stands because both address the scenario where a guarantor's awareness of the principal obligor's limited capacity leads to the presumption of an independent obligation.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess whether the given query entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root node, let's follow the structured approach step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article states that statutory liens may not be exercised against movables after they have been delivered to third-party acquirers. Thus, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: Statutory liens cannot be exercised against movables delivered to third-party acquirers.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: Delivery of movables to third-party acquirers.
- **A2**: Existence of statutory liens on the movables before delivery.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion based on the conditions they represent.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down the abstract factors into base-level factors:
- From **A1**, we get:
  - **B1**: The movables have been delivered to third-party acquirers in good faith.
  - **B2**: The delivery of movables to third-party acquirers was done without any prior notice of existing liens.
- From **A2**, we directly consider the scenario it presents, thus:
  - **B3**: Statutory liens were properly registered before the delivery of movables.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent. For instance, **B1** and **B2** support **A1**, indicating scenarios where the delivery affects the exercise of statutory liens. **B3** directly relates to **A2**, emphasizing the existence of liens.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **A1 supports R1**: The delivery of movables to third-party acquirers (A1) validates that statutory liens cannot be exercised against them (R1).
- **A2 denies R1**: The existence of statutory liens before delivery (A2) could potentially invalidate the conclusion that such liens cannot be exercised after delivery, depending on legal specifics not detailed here.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the nodes and links defined:
- Root Node: **R1**
- Abstract Factors: **A1**, **A2**
- Base-Level Factors: **B1**, **B2**, **B3**

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root
The query states, "Statutory liens for sale of movables may not be exercised with respect to the movable that are the subject matter of the same after the obligors have delivered those movables to third-party acquirers." This scenario closely aligns with **B1** and **B2**, as it considers the delivery of movables to third-party acquirers, implying a similar situation or scenario. Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query entails B2)**

Given that both **B1** and **B2** support **A1**, which in turn supports **R1**, and considering the context of the query aligns with the conditions leading to **R1**, it follows that:
- **(query agree R1)**

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of statutory liens and the delivery of movables, the initial assessment holds because the query directly addresses a scenario where statutory liens are affected by the delivery of movables to third-party acquirers, aligning with the conditions outlined in **R1**. 

Thus, the final justification confirms:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agrees R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 457 seeks to establish how the postponement of expiry and renewal of prescription periods affect guarantors, and under what conditions a guarantor can assert defenses or refuse performance. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A guarantor is bound by the same terms as the principal obligor regarding the prescription period and may raise certain defenses.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: Postponement of expiry and renewal of prescription periods apply equally to guarantors.
- **A2**: Guarantors can assert defenses available to the principal obligor.
- **A3**: The right to set-off, rescind, or cancel affects a guarantor's obligation.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down these abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- From **A1**:
  - **B1**: If the principal obligor requests performance, it can affect the prescription period for both parties.
- From **A2**:
  - **B2**: A guarantor can raise a defense if the principal obligor has a valid claim against the obligee.
- From **A3**:
  - **B3**: The existence of a right to set-off, rescind, or cancel for the principal obligor directly impacts the guarantor's obligations.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
Each abstract factor supports the root determination:
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Postponement and renewal rules support the equal binding terms.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): Ability to assert defenses supports the notion that guarantors are treated similarly to principal obligors.
- (**A3** supports **R1**): The impact of set-off, rescind, or cancel rights on obligations aligns with the principle that guarantors and principal obligors share similar legal standings in these matters.

Given the query: "Until the principal obligor offsets with a possessed claim, the guarantor cannot raise a defense vis-a-vis the obligee by setting off any claim."

### Justification of Query Entailment
- The query entails **B3** because it discusses the scenario where the right to set-off (a specific condition under **A3**) affects the guarantor's ability to raise a defense, which is directly related to how set-off rights impact obligations.

### Agreement with Root Node
- The query disagrees with **R1** in the context provided. **R1** generally states that a guarantor can be bound by similar terms as the principal obligor and may raise certain defenses. However, the query specifies a condition (until the principal obligor offsets) under which the guarantor cannot raise a defense by setting off a claim, suggesting a limitation or specific scenario not universally covered by **R1**.

Therefore:
- (query entails B3)
- (query disagrees R1)

After rejustification, considering the nuances of legal interpretations and the specifics of how set-off rights and their exercise impact both principal obligors and guarantors, it's clear that the initial analysis correctly identifies the relationship between the query and the base-level factor **B3** but might have oversimplified the agreement/disagreement with the root node **R1**. The query indeed highlights a specific condition affecting the guarantor's ability to raise defenses, which can be seen as an elaboration or a specific instance rather than a direct disagreement with the principle that guarantors are generally bound by similar terms and may raise certain defenses as outlined in **R1**. However, given the format and context provided:
- (query entails B3)
- (query disagrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the task step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 587 is that a loan for consumption becomes effective when certain conditions are met. Thus, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: A loan for consumption is effective.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine the effectiveness of a loan for consumption include:
- **A1**: The first party receives money or any other thing from the second party.
- **A2**: The promise to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity is made.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- From **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: Receipt of money.
  - **B2**: Receipt of any other thing.
- From **A2**, we have:
  - **B3**: Promise to return a thing of the same type.
  - **B4**: Promise to return a thing of the same quality.
  - **B5**: Promise to return a thing of the same quantity.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent. For example, B1 and B2 support A1, while B3, B4, and B5 support A2.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factor
- **A1** supports **R1**: The receipt of money or any other thing is a condition for the loan's effectiveness.
- **A2** supports **R1**: The promise to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity is also a condition for the loan's effectiveness.

Given the query: "A loan for consumption not made in writing becomes effective when a first party receives money or any other thing from a second party, having promised to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity."

### Justification
- The query entails **B1** and **B2** because it mentions receiving money or any other thing.
- The query also entails **B3**, **B4**, and **B5** since it includes promising to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity.

Regarding agreement with the root:
- The query essentially describes conditions under which a loan for consumption becomes effective, which aligns with **R1**. However, the original article does not explicitly mention the requirement for the loan to be in writing as a condition for its effectiveness. Despite this difference, the core conditions mentioned (receipt and promise to return) match those in **R1**, suggesting that in terms of the basic criteria for a loan's effectiveness, the query agrees with **R1**.

### Output
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)
- (query entails B4)
- (query entails B5)
- (query agree R1)

After rejustification, considering the specific mention of "not made in writing" in the query does not negate the core conditions for a loan's effectiveness as outlined in **R1**; it merely introduces an additional aspect (the absence of a written agreement) that doesn't directly conflict with **R1**'s basic criteria. Thus, the initial conclusions hold.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the query against this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article concludes that a manager is not liable to compensate for damage resulting from benevolent intervention in another's business unless the manager has acted in bad faith or with gross negligence. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A manager who intervenes benevolently in another's affairs is not liable for damages unless acting in bad faith or with gross negligence.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The intervention was made in good faith.
- **A2**: The intervention was necessary to prevent imminent danger to the principal's person, reputation, or property.
- **A3**: The manager acted with gross negligence.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A):
Breaking down the abstract factors into base-level factors:
- From **A1** (good faith intervention), we have:
  - **B1**: The manager believed their actions would benefit the principal.
  - **B2**: The manager had no personal gain in mind during the intervention.
- From **A2** (necessity of intervention), we have:
  - **B3**: The danger to the principal's person, reputation, or property was imminent and real.
- From **A3** (gross negligence), we have:
  - **B4**: The manager failed to exercise reasonable care during the intervention.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors:
- **A1 supports R1**: Intervention in good faith validates non-liability for damages.
- **A2 supports R1**: Necessity of the intervention also supports non-liability.
- **A3 denies R1**: Gross negligence negates the validation of non-liability, making the manager liable.

Given these definitions and links:

### Evaluating the Query:
The query involves a scenario where B repairs A's hedge without obligation but leaves it in a withered state after starting repairs. The key elements here are benevolent intervention (B acting for A without obligation) and potential negligence or bad faith (leaving the repair unfinished, leading to further damage).

- **Query entails B1**: Because B started the repair without any obligation, showing an intention that could be interpreted as beneficial towards A.
- **Query entails B4**: Since B left the hedge in the middle of repair, which led to it withering, indicating a lack of reasonable care or follow-through.

Considering these base-level factors and their implications on the abstract factors:
- The query does involve good faith (as per **B1**) but also indicates potential gross negligence (as per **B4**).

### Justification:
Given that the root node **R1** states a manager is not liable unless acting in bad faith or with gross negligence, and considering the scenario presented by the query:

- The presence of good faith (**A1**, supported by **B1**) would generally support non-liability (**R1**).
- However, the indication of gross negligence (**A3**, through **B4**) denies the validation of non-liability, suggesting liability.

Thus, considering the most comparable scenario and focusing on the critical aspect of potential gross negligence:

- **(query disagrees R1)**: The query suggests a situation where B's actions could lead to liability due to potential gross negligence, despite initial good faith, which contrasts with the non-liability conclusion of **R1**.

Upon reevaluation:
The conclusion remains that while there are elements of good faith intervention, the critical factor of potential gross negligence (as indicated by leaving the hedge unfinished and it withering as a result) is what leads to the disagreement with **R1**. Therefore, the justification stands that in this comparable situation, considering the specifics provided by the query, there's a disagreement with the root node's verdict due to the presence of gross negligence.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 587 and Article 588 can be summarized into a root node that captures the essence of when a loan for consumption becomes effective. The root node could be:
- **R1**: A loan for consumption is effective.

This root node seeks to establish under what conditions a loan for consumption is considered legally binding or valid.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
From Article 587 and Article 588, we can derive the following abstract factors that substantiate or undermine the effectiveness of a loan for consumption:
- **A1**: Receipt of Money or Thing - The borrower receives money or any other thing from the lender.
- **A2**: Promise to Return - The borrower promises to return a thing of the same type, quality, and quantity.
- **A3**: Agreement to Regard as Loan - Parties agree to regard the transaction as a loan for consumption.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion about the effectiveness of a loan for consumption.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- From **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The borrower receives money.
  - **B2**: The borrower receives another thing (not money).
- From **A2**, we have:
  - **B3**: The promise is to return a thing of the same type.
  - **B4**: The promise is to return a thing of the same quality.
  - **B5**: The promise is to return a thing of the same quantity.
- From **A3**, we directly have:
  - **B6**: Parties agree it's a loan for consumption.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **Support Links**:
  - (**B1** supports **A1**), (**B2** supports **A1**)
  - (**B3** supports **A2**), (**B4** supports **A2**), (**B5** supports **A2**)
  - (**B6** supports **A3**)
  - (**A1** supports **R1**), (**A2** supports **R1**), (**A3** supports **R1**)

Given the query: "A quasi-loan has no effect if the borrower does not deliver the subject matter of the quasi-loan to the lender."

### Justification
- The query directly relates to the conditions under which a loan (or in this case, a quasi-loan) is considered effective. It implies that for a loan to be effective, there must be an exchange or promise of return.
- (**query entails B1**), because it considers a scenario where the subject matter (money or thing) is not delivered, implying that delivery is necessary for the loan to have effect.
- (**query entails B6**), as it discusses the effectiveness of a quasi-loan based on an agreement or understanding between parties, similar to how **B6** supports the notion of a loan for consumption through mutual agreement.

However, upon closer inspection:
- The query specifically talks about the delivery of the subject matter by the borrower (in the context of a quasi-loan), which aligns more with the idea that a promise or agreement (**A2** and **A3**) is not enough if there's no action (delivery) from the borrower.
- Therefore, it actually supports the idea that for a loan to be effective, certain conditions (like delivery or return promise) must be met, which aligns with **R1** under specific circumstances.

Considering this, we see that:
- (**query agree R1**), because both the query and **R1** are concerned with the conditions under which a loan is considered effective. The query specifies a condition (delivery of subject matter) without which a quasi-loan has no effect, which can be seen as supporting the general principle that loans for consumption have specific effectiveness criteria.

After re-justification:
The conclusion remains that the query entails base-level factors related to the conditions necessary for a loan's effectiveness and agrees with the root node on the necessity of certain conditions for a loan to be considered effective. 

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

 To address the given task, let's break down the process step by step according to the provided instructions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. Based on Article 19, the root node can be identified as:
- R1: The family court must rescind the decision for commencement of curatorship or assistance if it decides to commence a guardianship and the person in question is under curatorship or assistance.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From Article 19, we can derive:
- A1: The commencement of guardianship for a person under curatorship or assistance requires the rescission of the curatorship or assistance decision.
- A2: The same principle applies mutatis mutandis to other combinations (commencement of curatorship for an adult ward or person under assistance, and commencement of assistance for an adult ward or person under curatorship).

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific scenarios:
- B1: If a person is under curatorship and the court decides to commence guardianship, the curatorship decision must be rescinded.
- B2: If a person is under assistance and the court decides to commence guardianship, the assistance decision must be rescinded.
- B3: Other mutatis mutandis scenarios as described in Article 19(2), such as the court deciding to commence curatorship for an adult ward or a person under assistance.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- A1 supports R1 because it directly states the condition under which a decision must be rescinded.
- A2 supports R1 by extending the principle to other similar scenarios, thus reinforcing the need for rescission in various contexts.

Given the query: "In cases any ruling for commencement of guardianship to a person under assistance is to be made, the family court need not to rescind the ruling of commencement of assistance pertaining to such person."

### Analysis
- The query directly contradicts B2, which states that if a person is under assistance and the court decides to commence guardianship, the assistance decision must be rescinded.
- Therefore, (query entails B2) because it discusses the same scenario but comes to an opposite conclusion.
- Given that B2 supports R1 (the need for rescission), and the query contradicts B2, it means the query disagrees with R1 in this specific context.
- Hence, (query disagree R1).

After rejustification, considering the direct opposition of the query to the principle stated in Article 19 regarding the necessity of rescinding assistance when commencing guardianship for a person under assistance, the conclusion remains that the query entails a base-level factor but disagrees with the root node's verdict in this comparable situation.

Output:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 511 is that a third party obligor of a claim which has been attached may not assert set-off as defense with any claim acquired after the attachment against the attaching obligee but may assert set-off based on a claim acquired before the attachment.

- **Root Node (R1):** A third party obligor may assert set-off against the attaching obligee using a claim held prior to the attachment.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- The timing of when the claim was acquired by the third party obligor relative to the attachment.
- The right of set-off in relation to attached claims.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The claim was acquired before the attachment.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The principle that set-off can be used as a defense against an attaching obligee under specific conditions.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

From A1, we have:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** If the claim was acquired before the attachment, then the third party obligor may assert set-off.
  
From A2, considering its conditionality:
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The right to set-off is valid if it does not violate the principles of attachment and obligations.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

- **A1 supports R1:** Because having a claim before the attachment is a condition under which set-off can be asserted.
- **A2 supports R1:** Since it outlines the principle that set-off can be used, supporting the root's conclusion.

There are no deny links in this scenario as all conditions support the ability to assert set-off under specific circumstances.

### Analysis of Query

Given query: "A third party obligor of a claim which has been attached may assert, against the attaching obligee, set-off using the claim against the attached obligor held prior to the attachment."

- **(query entails B1):** Because both consider asserting set-off with claims acquired before the attachment.
  
- **(query agree R1):** Since both conclude that a third party obligor may assert set-off against the attaching obligee when using a claim held prior to the attachment, thus agreeing on the verdict in comparable situations.

Upon rejustification, considering the legal context provided and the structure constructed:
- The query indeed aligns with Base-Level Factor B1 as it specifies the use of claims acquired before the attachment for set-off.
- The agreement with Root Node R1 is also affirmed because both state that a third party obligor can assert set-off using a claim held prior to the attachment, which directly supports the root's legal conclusion.

Thus, the final analysis confirms:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish the timing of rent payment for different types of properties. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1:** Rent must be paid according to specific timelines based on the type of property.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **A1:** The type of property (movables, buildings, land for residential purposes, other land) affects the rent payment timeline.
- **A2:** The existence of a harvest season can alter the standard rent payment timeline.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factor A1:
- **B1:** For movables and buildings used for residential purposes, rent is paid at the end of the month.
- **B2:** For other types of land, rent is paid at the end of the year.
From Abstract Factor A2:
- **B3:** If there's a harvest season, rent must be paid immediately after that season.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A1)
- (B3 supports A2)

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factor
Abstract factors support the root determination:
- (A1 supports R1): The type of property directly influences the rent payment timeline, supporting the root conclusion.
- (A2 supports R1): The consideration of harvest seasons for certain properties also supports the nuanced approach to determining rent payment timelines outlined in the root.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria Compliance
The structure complies with all criteria:
- **Existence of a Root Node:** R1 is defined.
- **Single Directed Linkage:** Each factor has one directed link.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships:** Nodes, their context, and links are clearly defined.
- **Node Naming Convention:** Follows the specified format (R1, A1, B1).
- **Link Representation Format:** Links are represented as specified (e.g., "supports" or "denies").

### Justification
Given the query: "Both the timing of payment of rent in a contract for lease and the timing of payment of interest in a contract for loan for consumption may freely be determined by the agreement of the parties."

- The query **disagrees with R1** because it suggests flexibility based on party agreements, whereas R1 outlines specific timelines based on property types without mentioning such flexibility.

Upon re-justification:
- Considering the context and focusing strictly on the provided legal article's content, the query indeed introduces a concept (flexibility in payment timing based on agreements) that contrasts with the specific guidelines for rent payments outlined in Article 614.
- The key point of contention is whether the parties can freely determine the timing of rent payments versus adhering to the timelines specified by law based on property types and harvest seasons.

Therefore, after careful consideration:
- **(query disagrees R1)**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this framework, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) represents the primary legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish or refute. Based on Article 537, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A contract where one party promises to render a certain performance to a third party is valid even if the third party does not exist or is not specified at the time of the contract's formation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root node's conclusion.
- **A1**: The existence or specification of a third party at the time of contract formation does not affect the contract's validity regarding performances promised to that third party.
- **A2**: The promise of performance to a third party who is not yet born or specified can be considered a valid contractual agreement.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are more specific scenarios or conditions derived from abstract factors.
- From **A1**:
  - **B1**: If the contract stipulates that a performance will be rendered to a third party who is not yet born, the contract remains valid.
  - **B2**: If the contract does not specify the third party at the time of formation, but they exist, the contract is still valid.
- From **A2**:
  - **B3**: The contractual agreement for performance to a non-specified or unborn third party is valid as per Article 537(2).

### 4. Establish Directed Links
Directed links can either support or deny the root determination or another abstract factor.
- **Support Link**: A1 supports R1, indicating that the validity of a contract promising performance to an unspecified or non-existent third party aligns with the root node's conclusion.
- **Support Link**: A2 supports R1, further validating contracts where performances are promised to unborn or unspecified third parties.
- There are no deny links in this scenario as both abstract factors support the root node.

### Evaluating the Query
Given the query: "If the contract of sale stipulates that F, who was not born at the time of the conclusion of the contract, is to acquire the ownership of X, the contract of sale is invalid."

- **(query entails B1)** because both consider a scenario where a performance (acquiring ownership) is promised to an unborn third party.
- However, **(query disagree R1)** because the query concludes that such a contract would be invalid, whereas the root node (R1), supported by abstract factors and base-level factors, suggests that the contract remains valid even if the third party is not yet born.

After re-evaluation, considering the structure and links established:
- The query directly contradicts the conclusion of R1 based on the information provided in Article 537. This article explicitly states that the validity of a contract promising performance to a third party (who may not exist or be specified at the time of contract formation) is not impaired.
- Therefore, the initial evaluation stands: **(query entails B1)** and **(query disagree R1)**.

This analysis demonstrates how the ANGELIC structure can be applied to legal provisions to evaluate queries against established legal principles and conclusions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 466-2 is that if a claim for payment of money subject to the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment is assigned to a third party, the obligor may deposit the amount of money equivalent to the full amount of the claim with an official depository.

- **Root Node (R1):** An obligor may deposit the amount of money equivalent to the full amount of the claim with an official depository if the claim is subject to a manifestation of intention to restrict assignment and has been assigned to a third party.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The claim is for payment of money.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** There is a manifestation of intention to restrict assignment.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The claim has been assigned to a third party.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The claim is specifically for the payment of a sales price.
    - **Support Link:** (B1 supports A1)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The restriction on assignment is explicitly stated in a special agreement between parties.
    - **Support Link:** (B2 supports A2)
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The assignment to the third party was done despite the restriction.
    - **Support Link:** (B3 supports A3)

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

Each abstract factor either supports or denies the root determination:
- **Support Link:** (A1 supports R1)
- **Support Link:** (A2 supports R1)
- **Support Link:** (A3 supports R1)

There are no deny links from these abstract factors to the root node because all conditions provided in the article support the conclusion that the obligor may deposit the amount of money equivalent to the full amount of the claim under the specified circumstances.

### Justification

Given the query: Claim X, the claim of the payment of the sales price of A against B, has a special agreement prohibiting the assignment, but Claim X was assigned. In this case, B may deposit the amount of money equivalent to the full amount of the claim with an official depository.

- **Query entails Base-Level Factor:** (query entails B1) because both involve claims for payment of sales prices.
- **Query entails Base-Level Factor:** (query entails B2) since there's a special agreement restricting assignment.
- **Query entails Base-Level Factor:** (query entails B3) as the claim was assigned despite the restriction.

Considering these base-level factors and their support links to abstract factors, which in turn support the root node R1, we can conclude that:
- **Query agrees with Root R1:** (query agree R1) because all conditions specified in the query align with those outlined in Article 466-2 for allowing an obligor to deposit the claim amount with an official depository.

Upon careful reconsideration, this analysis remains consistent. The presence of a sales price claim, a special agreement restricting assignment, and the action of assigning the claim despite this restriction all directly support the conditions under which the obligor may make such a deposit according to Article 466-2. Therefore, the query indeed agrees with the root node R1 regarding the legal conclusion that B may deposit the amount equivalent to the full amount of Claim X with an official depository.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then justify whether the query entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish or refute. Based on Article 196(2), the root node can be identified as:

- **R1**: A possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for either the costs the possessor has paid or the amount of the increased value, whichever the person recovering the thing chooses.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion represented by the root node. From Article 196(2), we can derive:

- **A1**: The possessor's right to reimbursement for beneficial expenses is contingent upon a current increase in value.
- **A2**: The status of the possessor (in good faith or bad faith) affects the terms under which reimbursement may be claimed.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Base-level factors specify conditions under which abstract factors apply. For A1 and A2:

- **B1** (child of A1): There is a current increase in value due to the possessor's expenses.
- **B2** (child of A2): The possessor is in good faith, thus affecting the reimbursement terms without a court-granted period for repayment.
- **B3** (child of A2): The possessor is in bad faith, allowing the court to grant a reasonable period for reimbursement at the request of the person recovering the thing.

### 4. Establish Directed Links

Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root determination or another abstract factor:

- **(A1 supports R1)**: Because A1 (current increase in value) is a condition that validates the possessor's right to reimbursement, it directly supports the root conclusion.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The distinction between good and bad faith possessors affects how reimbursement can be claimed but does not negate the right to reimbursement itself; thus, A2 also supports R1 by specifying conditions under which R1 applies.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "A possessor claimed the reimbursement of beneficial expenses against the owner when the possessor returned the thing in possession. In this case, the court may, at the request of the owner, grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement even if the possessor was in good faith."

- **(Query entails B3)**: The query discusses a scenario where the court grants a reasonable period for reimbursement, which aligns with the condition specified under B3 (possessor in bad faith). However, it introduces a twist by applying this to a possessor in good faith. This suggests a misunderstanding or misapplication of Article 196(2) as described, because the article specifies that the court may grant a reasonable period at the request of the person recovering the thing specifically for possessors in bad faith.
  
- **(Query disagrees R1)**: The query seems to modify the conditions under which reimbursement can be claimed (by suggesting a court-granted period even for good faith possessors), which does not directly align with the original root conclusion as stated. This indicates a disagreement with how R1 is interpreted or applied in the scenario described by the query.

### Rejustification

Upon reevaluation, it's clear that the initial interpretation correctly identifies the root node and abstract factors but may have introduced complexity in distinguishing between good faith and bad faith possessors' rights to reimbursement under specific conditions. The query indeed attempts to apply a condition (court-granted period for reimbursement) typically associated with bad faith possessors to those in good faith, suggesting a potential misunderstanding of Article 196(2)'s application.

The final answer is: 
- (query entails B3)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 715 is to establish the liability of an employer for damage inflicted by their employee during the execution of business, with conditions for exemption from this liability.

- **Root Node (R1):** An employer is liable for damage caused by their employees in the course of business unless they can prove they exercised reasonable care or the damage was unavoidable.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
- The exercise of reasonable care by the employer in appointing or supervising the employee.
- The inevitability of the damage despite reasonable care.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Reasonable care was exercised by the employer.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Damage could not have been avoided even with reasonable care.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down abstract factors into base-level factors:
- For A1, a base-level factor could be:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The employer conducted thorough background checks on the employee before hiring.
- For A2, a base-level factor could be:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The damage resulted from an unforeseeable event.

Each of these base-level factors supports its respective abstract factor. Thus,
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **A1 supports R1:** If the employer exercised reasonable care, it validates their liability exemption.
- **A2 supports R1:** If the damage was unavoidable, it also validates the employer's exemption from liability.

However, given the structure and focusing on the denial aspect:
- There is no direct deny link established in the initial setup as both A1 and A2 support conditions under which the employer is not liable. The query suggests a scenario where the employer compensates but questions the right to reimbursement, which may imply a specific condition not directly addressed by the abstract factors as defined.

### Query Analysis
The query states: "Even if an employer compensates a third party for damage based on the liability of employers for the employee's harmful act, the employer's right to reimbursement against the employee does not arise."

- **Justification regarding Base-Level Factors:** The query seems to touch upon scenarios related to the exercise of rights after compensation but doesn't directly align with B1 or B2 as these factors deal with conditions for liability exemption rather than post-liability actions.
  
- **Justification regarding Root Node (R1):** The query essentially discusses a situation where an employer has taken on liability (and thus compensated) but questions the subsequent right to reimbursement. This scenario suggests that while R1 addresses the initial liability, it doesn't directly speak to the post-compensation rights or processes.

Given the above analysis and focusing strictly on the provided instructions for output format:

- The query does not directly entail any of the base-level factors as defined (B1, B2) since these pertain to conditions for liability exemption rather than the process of reimbursement after compensation has been made.
- The query seems to disagree with an implied extension or interpretation of R1 regarding post-compensation rights, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of employer liabilities and rights beyond the initial determination of liability.

Therefore, in terms of direct output based on the provided instructions:
- (query entails no base-level factor directly).
- Given the nature of the query and its focus on reimbursement rights rather than initial liability conditions, it might be seen as touching upon aspects not directly covered by R1 or suggesting a scenario where the application of R1 leads to further questions about employer rights post-compensation. Thus, a strict interpretation based on provided instructions would lead to:
- (query disagree R1), if interpreting the query as challenging the straightforward application of liability and reimbursement rights as might be implied by R1 without additional context.

29 correct 14 wrongs 43 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process step by step according to the provided legal provisions and the structure required.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Based on Article 564 and the context of the query about a buyer being able to cancel a contract due to a latent defect in the subject of a sale and demanding compensation for damages, we can identify the root node as:
- R1: A buyer can cancel a contract and demand compensation for damages if the subject of a sale has a latent defect.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From the articles provided, we can derive several abstract factors:
- A1: The presence of a latent defect in the subject of a sale that significantly affects its value or usability.
- A2: The right to cancel a contract due to non-performance or impossibility of performance (as per Articles 541 and 542).
- A3: The entitlement to claim compensation for loss or damage arising from the failure to perform an obligation (Article 415).

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors specify conditions under which abstract factors apply. For each abstract factor, we can identify:
- B1 (under A1): The latent defect is significant enough to render the subject of the sale unusable or significantly less valuable than described.
- B2 (under A2): The seller's failure to deliver a defect-free product constitutes a non-performance that justifies contract cancellation.
- B3 (under A3): The buyer has suffered a direct loss due to the latent defect, which can be compensated for under the provisions of Article 415.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Each abstract factor must support or deny the root determination. We establish:
- Support Link: (A1 supports R1), because the presence of a significant latent defect directly supports the buyer's right to cancel and claim damages.
- Support Link: (A2 supports R1), as it provides the legal basis for contract cancellation due to non-performance.
- Support Link: (A3 supports R1), since it allows for compensation in cases of loss or damage from non-performance.

### Justification
Given the query "In cases where the subject of a sale has a latent defect, the buyer can cancel the contract and demand compensation for damages," we analyze:
- **Entailment with Base-Level Factors**: The query directly entails B1, as it involves a scenario where the subject of a sale has a latent defect affecting its value or usability. It also entails B2 and B3, considering the right to cancellation and compensation due to such defects.
- **Agreement with Root Node R1**: The query agrees with R1 because both assert that a buyer can cancel a contract and demand damages in the presence of a latent defect.

### Output
Based on the analysis:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

Upon re-justification, considering the details provided in the articles and the structure of the angelic framework, it's clear that the query directly aligns with the conditions outlined for cancelling a contract due to latent defects and claiming compensation. Therefore, the agreement between the query and the root node regarding the buyer's rights in such scenarios is confirmed.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to address the query, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The Root Node (R) is determined by answering the question: What legal conclusion or verdict does the article seek to establish or refute?

- **R1**: The establishment of a servitude can be asserted against a third party if the transfer of ownership of the dominant land is registered, given that the servitude has been registered for the servient land.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract Factors are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion. 

- **A1**: Registration of the servitude for the servient land is a necessary condition.
- **A2**: Transfer of ownership of the dominant land must be registered to assert the transfer of the servitude against third parties.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

- From **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The establishment of a servitude has been registered for the servient land.
  
- From **A2**, we have:
  - **B2**: The transfer of ownership of the dominant land is registered.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

- **(B1 supports A1)**: Registration of the servitude for the servient land supports the condition necessary for asserting the servitude.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Registration of the transfer of the dominant land supports the condition for asserting the transfer of the servitude against third parties.
  
- **A1** and **A2** both support **R1**, as they provide the conditions under which the establishment of a servitude can be asserted against a third party.

### Query Justification

Given the query: "If the establishment of a servitude has been registered for the servient land, and the dominant land is transferred, the transferee may assert the transfer of the servitude against a third party if the transfer of ownership of the dominant land is registered."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query mentions that the establishment of a servitude has been registered for the servient land, which aligns with **B1**.
- **(query entails B2)**: The query also states that the transfer of ownership of the dominant land is registered, which aligns with **B2**.

Considering **R1**, the query presents a scenario where both conditions (**B1** and **B2**) for asserting the servitude against third parties are met. Therefore:

- **(query agree R1)**: The query agrees with **R1** because it outlines a situation where the transferee can indeed assert the transfer of the servitude against a third party, given that both necessary conditions (registration of the servitude and registration of the dominant land's ownership transfer) are fulfilled.

After careful consideration, this justification holds true based on the provided legal framework. The query essentially describes a scenario that aligns with the conditions stipulated by **A1** and **A2**, thereby supporting the conclusion presented in **R1**.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article concludes that a pledge secures not just the principal but also interest, penalties, expenses of enforcing the pledge, expense of preserving the thing pledged, and compensation for loss or damage arising from failure to perform obligations or latent defects in the thing pledged, unless the act establishing the pledge provides otherwise.

- **Root Node (R1):** A pledge secures all associated costs and liabilities, including interest, by default.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The existence of a special provision between the pledgee and pledgor that alters the default coverage of the pledge.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The principle that pledges are intended to secure not just the principal amount but also associated costs and liabilities, ensuring the pledgee's full recovery.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** A special provision explicitly excludes interest from being secured by the pledge.
    - **Support Link:** (B1 supports A1)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The general principle that pledges secure all costs and liabilities associated with the principal amount, including interest.
    - **Support Link:** (B2 supports A2)

### 4. Establish Directed Links of Abstract Factors

- **Support Link:** (A2 supports R1) because the principle behind securing all associated costs validates the default coverage of a pledge.
- **Deny Link:** (A1 denies A2) because a special provision altering the default coverage negates the general principle's application.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "Even if there is a special provision, between pledgee and pledgor, that the pledge does not secure the interest, the pledge of movables shall secure such interest."

- **Entailment:** The query directly relates to Base-Level Factor B1, which considers a scenario where a special provision alters the default coverage. Therefore, (query entails B1).
  
### Agreement with Root

The query suggests that despite any special provisions, the pledge should secure interest. This aligns with the principle behind R1 but seems to contradict it because R1 allows for exceptions based on special provisions.

- **Agreement/Disagreement:** The query actually disagrees with the nuance of R1 as stated in the original article because it implies that pledges should always secure interest, regardless of special provisions. Thus, (query disagree R1).

### Rejustification

Upon reevaluation, considering the specific wording of the query and its implications:

- The query indeed directly relates to the concept of securing interest through a pledge, despite any special agreements.
- However, it's crucial to understand that the original article allows for exceptions based on how the pledge is established. The query seems to override this by stating that pledges shall secure interest regardless.

Therefore, the conclusion stands: (query entails B1) and (query disagree R1), as the query presents a scenario where the default coverage of a pledge is not altered by special provisions, contrary to what the original article suggests is possible.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query, we follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 298 seeks to establish that if the holder of a right of retention violates certain provisions, the obligor may demand that the right of retention be terminated. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The obligor may demand termination of the right of retention under certain conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion are:
- **A1**: Violation of the duty to possess the thing retained with due care.
- **A2**: Unauthorized use, leasing, or provision as security of the thing retained without the obligor's consent.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From **A1** and **A2**, we can derive:
- **B1**: The holder fails to maintain the thing retained with the care expected of a prudent manager.
- **B2**: The holder leases the thing retained without obtaining the obligor's consent.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent. For example, **B1** supports **A1**, and **B2** supports **A2**.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **A1** supports **R1**: Violating the duty of care supports the obligor's right to demand termination.
- **A2** supports **R1**: Unauthorized use, leasing, or provision as security also supports the obligor's right to demand termination.

### Analysis of Query
Given query: "If a holder of a right of retention leased the thing retained unless he/she obtains the consent of the obligor, the obligor may demand that the right of retention be extinguished."

- **(query entails B2)** because both the query and **B2** consider scenarios where the holder leases the thing retained without the obligor's consent.
- **(query agree R1)** since both the query and **R1** conclude that under such conditions (specifically, leasing without consent), the obligor may demand termination or extinguishment of the right of retention.

Upon rejustification, it remains clear that the query aligns with the conditions outlined in **B2** and supports the conclusion presented in **R1**, indicating agreement on the verdict regarding the obligor's rights under the described scenario. 

Output:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, we will follow the steps outlined to construct the ANGELIC structure and then evaluate the query against this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by the legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. In this case, the root node can be formulated as:
- R1: An administrator does not need permission from the family court to perform acts within their specified authority.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion. Based on Articles 28 and 103, we identify:
- A1: The existence of a specific authority granted to the administrator.
- A2: The nature of the act (whether it's for preservation, use, or improvement without changing the nature of the thing or right).
- A3: Uncertainty regarding the absentee's status (dead or alive) and its impact on the administrator's authority.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- B1 (child of A1): The act is within the administrator's specifically defined authority.
- B2 (child of A2): The act is for preservation or improvement without altering the nature of the thing or right.
- B3 (child of A3): The absentee's status is unclear, but the act does not exceed the authority established by the absentee.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- Support Link: (B1 supports R1), because if an administrator acts within their defined authority, they do not need permission.
- Support Link: (B2 supports R1), as acts of preservation or improvement without changing the nature of the thing/right are within the administrator's authority.
- Deny Link: (A3 denies R1), because uncertainty about the absentee's status might require additional permission.

### Evaluating the Query
The query states that B, the administrator of A's property, does not need to obtain permission from the family court when paying a debt obligation due to E for the benefit of A. This scenario aligns with Base-Level Factor B1, as paying a debt can be considered an act within the administrator's authority for the preservation or management of the absentee's assets.

### Conclusion
- (query entails B1), because the query involves an administrator performing an act that is presumably within their specified authority.
- (query agree R1), since both the query and R1 conclude that in certain scenarios, such as acting within defined authority, the administrator does not need permission from the family court.

After rejustification, considering the specifics of Article 103 and the nature of the administrator's role, it is clear that acts like paying debts for the benefit of the absentee can be seen as part of the administrator's duties without needing additional court permission, thus supporting the agreement with R1.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 304 seeks to establish that a statutory lien may be exercised against things including monies that the obligor is to receive as a result of certain events related to the subject matter of the statutory lien. Thus, the root node can be formulated as:
- **R1**: A holder of a statutory lien can exercise the lien against things including monies received due to sale, lease, loss, or damage of the subject matter.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The existence of a statutory lien.
- **A2**: The obligor receiving monies as a result of specific events (sale, lease, loss, or damage) related to the subject matter.
- **A3**: The requirement for the holder of the statutory lien to attach the monies before payment or delivery.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- **B1** (child of A2): The obligor receives monies due to the loss of the subject matter.
- **B2** (child of A3): The attachment of monies by the lien holder before payment or delivery.

Each base-level factor has a support link to its abstract parent. For example:
- **B1 supports A2**: Because if the obligor receives monies due to loss, it falls under the scenarios where the statutory lien can be exercised.
- **B2 supports A3**: As attachment is a necessary step for exercising the lien.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **A1 supports R1**: The existence of a statutory lien directly supports the conclusion that it can be exercised against certain monies.
- **A2 supports R1**: Receiving monies due to specific events related to the subject matter supports the exercise of the lien.
- **A3 supports R1**: The requirement for attachment before payment or delivery is a condition that, when met, supports the exercise of the lien.

### Analysis of Query
Given query: "A holder of a right of retention may exercise against Things including monies that the obligor is to receive as a result of the loss of the subject matter."

- The query **entails B1** because both consider the scenario where monies are received due to the loss of the subject matter.
- Since **B1 supports A2**, and **A2 supports R1**, we can infer that in the comparable situation, the query aligns with the root's verdict. Therefore, **query agree R1**.

Justification:
The query essentially presents a scenario (exercising a right of retention against monies received due to loss) that falls under the conditions outlined for exercising a statutory lien as per Article 304. Although the query specifies "a holder of a right of retention" instead of "a holder of a statutory lien," the context provided by the article suggests that similar principles might apply, especially considering the focus on the type of event (loss) and the subject matter (monies received as a result). Thus, in the context of the provided legal provisions and focusing strictly on the scenario presented, the query aligns with the root node's determination regarding the exercise of rights against monies received due to specific events related to the subject matter.

Re-justification:
Upon re-evaluation, considering the distinction between "a right of retention" and "a statutory lien," there might be nuances in legal interpretations that could affect the direct applicability of Article 304 to the query. However, based on the information given and focusing on the structural analysis provided, the conclusion that **query entails B1** and **query agree R1** remains consistent within the framework of the ANGELIC structure as constructed.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 (query entails B1).(query agree R1).
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and address the query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node (R) represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 545, the root node can be identified as follows:
- **R1**: When exercising the right to cancel, each party must restore the other party to its original state.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion represented by the root node.
- **A1**: The obligation to refund monies with accrued interest.
- **A2**: The requirement to return things other than money along with any fruits that have accrued.
- **A3**: The preservation of rights for compensation for loss or damage despite cancellation.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

We create base-level factors by specifying conditions under each abstract factor:
- Under **A1**:
  - **B1**: Refunding monies with interest accrual from the time of receipt.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B2**: Returning non-monetary items along with accrued fruits.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B3**: Claiming compensation for loss or damage after cancellation.

Each base-level factor has a support link to its abstract parent. For example, (B1 supports A1), (B2 supports A2), and (B3 supports A3).

### 4. Establish Directed Links of Abstract Factors

Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination:
- **A1** supports **R1**, as refunding monies with interest is part of restoring the original state.
- **A2** supports **R1**, because returning non-monetary items along with their fruits also contributes to restoring the original state.
- **A3** does not directly deny or support **R1** but rather complements it by stating that cancellation does not preclude claims for compensation.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria

Given the query: "In restoring to the original state when the right to cancel has been exercised, if a thing other than money is to be returned, fruits that have accrued on or after the time of the receipt of the thing must also be returned."

- This query directly relates to **B2**, which specifies returning non-monetary items along with their accrued fruits.
- Therefore, **(query entails B2)**.

Since **B2** supports **A2**, and **A2** in turn supports **R1**, the query indirectly agrees with **R1**, as both deal with aspects of restoring parties to their original state upon cancellation.
- Thus, **(query agree R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering the specific scenario presented by the query and how it aligns with the base-level factor **B2** and subsequently supports the root node **R1**, the initial assessment holds true. The query is indeed about returning non-monetary items with their fruits upon cancellation, which is a part of restoring the original state as mandated by **R1**.

Therefore, the justified output remains:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 526 can be summarized as follows:
- **Root Node (R1):** "The offer is not effective."

This root node represents the main conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish under certain conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The offeror's death after issuing the notice of the offer.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The offeror coming to be in a constant state wherein they lack mental capacity after issuing the notice of the offer.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The offeror becoming subject to restrictions on legal capacity to act after issuing the notice of the offer.
- **Abstract Factor (A4):** The manifestation of the intention by the offeror not to make the offer effective should any of these facts occur.
- **Abstract Factor (A5):** The other party coming to know that any of these facts has occurred before issuing a notice of acceptance.

These abstract factors cover various legal scenarios and principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion about the effectiveness of the offer.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factors, we derive more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The offeror dies after issuing the notice of the offer, and this fact is known to the other party before they issue a notice of acceptance.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The offeror lacks mental capacity after issuing the notice of the offer, and this condition is known to the other party before they issue a notice of acceptance.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The offeror becomes subject to restrictions on legal capacity to act after issuing the notice of the offer, with the knowledge of the other party before they issue a notice of acceptance.
- **Base-Level Factor (B4):** The offeror has explicitly stated that the offer should not be effective if they die or lack mental capacity.
- **Base-Level Factor (B5):** The other party's knowledge of any of these conditions occurring before accepting the offer.

Each base-level factor specifies a condition and must have a support link to its abstract parent, indicating that it provides evidence for the scenario described by the abstract factor.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **Support Link:** Each Base-Level Factor supports its respective Abstract Factor.
    - (B1 supports A1)
    - (B2 supports A2)
    - (B3 supports A3)
    - (B4 supports A4)
    - (B5 supports A5)
- **Deny/Attack Links:** For the purpose of this structure, there are no deny links between abstract factors or from abstract factors to the root node that negate the support effect. All conditions lead to the offer not being effective.
- Each Abstract Factor supports the Root Node (R1), as they all contribute to the conclusion that the offer is not effective under certain conditions.
    - (A1 supports R1)
    - (A2 supports R1)
    - (A3 supports R1)
    - (A4 supports R1)
    - (A5 supports R1)

### Justification of Query and ANGELIC Structure Agreement
Given the query: "If an offeror of a contract comes to be in a constant state wherein the offeror lacks mental capacity after issuing notice of the offer, and the other party comes to know such fact has occurred before issuing a notice of acceptance, the offer is not effective."

- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** (query entails B2) because both consider the scenario where the offeror lacks mental capacity, and this is known to the other party before they issue an acceptance.
- **Query Agreement with Root Node:** (query agree R1) since both conclude that under these conditions, the offer is not effective.

Upon careful reconsideration, this analysis holds true as it accurately reflects the legal principles outlined in Article 526 regarding the effectiveness of an offer under specified conditions. The query directly aligns with Base-Level Factor B2 and supports the conclusion represented by Root Node R1, indicating that the offer's ineffectiveness is a direct result of the offeror's lack of mental capacity being known to the other party before acceptance.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this framework, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by the outcome of Article 519, which states that if an obligee manifests the intention to release an obligor from an obligation to that obligor, the obligee's claim is extinguished. Thus, the root node can be formulated as:
- **R1**: The obligee's claim is extinguished when the obligee manifests the intention to release the obligor.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion of the root node. Based on Article 519, we can derive:
- **A1**: Manifestation of intention by the obligee to release the obligor.
This abstract factor supports the extinction of the obligee's claim.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
- **B1**: The obligee explicitly states their intention to release the obligor from the obligation.
This base-level factor mirrors the scenario covered by **A1** and has a support link to its abstract parent **A1**.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factor
- (**B1 supports A1**): Since explicit statement of intention is a form of manifestation, it supports the concept that the obligee's claim can be extinguished through such an action.
- (**A1 supports R1**): Manifestation of intention to release directly leads to the extinction of the claim.

### Evaluating the Query
The query states: "the obligee(B) may not manifest his/her intention to release an obligation to the obligor(A) against the will of the obligor(A)."

- **Justification 1**: The query considers a scenario where the obligee's manifestation of intention is contingent upon the obligor's willingness. This introduces a condition (the obligor's consent) not explicitly covered by the base-level factor **B1** or abstract factor **A1**, which primarily focus on the act of manifestation without specifying the need for mutual agreement.
  
- **Justification 2**: Re-evaluating, we see that **B1** and **A1** do not directly address the obligor's will. The query essentially introduces a new condition (obligor's consent) which is not part of the original base-level factors or abstract factors derived from Article 519.

- **Conclusion on Entailment**: Given the introduction of a new condition (the obligor's willingness), it seems the query does not directly entail **B1** as it introduces a scenario not explicitly covered by **B1** or **A1**. However, upon closer inspection, the core issue is whether the obligee can unilaterally manifest intention to release without the obligor's consent affecting this process according to Article 519. The article does not specify that the obligor's consent is required for such a manifestation; hence, the query seems to imply a condition (mutual agreement) not explicitly addressed by **R1**, **A1**, or **B1**.

- **Agreement with Root**: Considering the most comparable scenario, if we interpret the query as questioning whether the obligee's claim can be extinguished without the obligor's consent, it might seem to disagree with **R1** because **R1** does not condition the extinction of the claim on the obligor's consent. However, upon careful consideration, Article 519 does indeed suggest that the obligee's manifestation of intention is sufficient for the claim's extinction, without explicitly requiring the obligor's agreement.

Given these considerations:
- The query introduces a scenario (consideration of the obligor's will) not directly addressed by **B1** or **A1**, but upon reevaluation, it seems more about how one interprets the necessity of mutual consent in Article 519.
- The core of Article 519 and thus **R1** is about the effect of the obligee's manifestation of intention to release, without specifying a need for the obligor's agreement.

Therefore:
- (query does not directly entail B1 due to introducing a consideration of the obligor's will, but this might be seen as a misunderstanding since B1 and A1 focus on the act of manifestation).
- Upon careful reconsideration, realizing that Article 519 focuses solely on the obligee's action without necessitating the obligor's consent for claim extinction, it appears there was an initial misinterpretation regarding entailment and agreement.

Revisiting the Output Format for Clarity:
- **(query does not directly entail B1)** because it introduces a new consideration (obligor's consent).
- However, upon deeper analysis, recognizing that Article 519's focus is on the obligee's action without requiring the obligor's consent might suggest a misunderstanding in initial conclusions about agreement or disagreement with **R1**. 

Given this nuanced understanding and focusing strictly on the provided output format instructions:
- The query seems to introduce a new condition not directly addressed by **B1**, suggesting it does not straightforwardly entail **B1**.
- The core of Article 519 (**R1**) is about the obligee's manifestation leading to claim extinction, which doesn't inherently require the obligor's consent. 

Thus, after careful reconsideration:
- (query does not directly entail B1).
- And upon reevaluation for clarity and adherence to the original article's focus, recognizing that the query might imply a condition (obligor's consent) not explicitly required by Article 519 for claim extinction, it suggests an initial misunderstanding in how the query relates to **R1**.
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 (query does not directly entail B1).(query agrees with R1).
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined below:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node (R) represents the primary legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 117, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A person who concludes a contract as an agent of another person is liable for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage unless they prove their authority to represent or the principal ratifies the contract.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors are key legal principles that either support or undermine the root conclusion. From Article 117, we can derive:
- **A1**: The agent's lack of authority to represent.
- **A2**: The counterparty's knowledge or negligence regarding the agent's authority.
- **A3**: Restrictions on the agent's legal capacity to act.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

Breaking down abstract factors into more specific base-level factors:
- From **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The agent had no actual authority to represent the principal.
  - **B2**: The principal did not ratify the contract.
- From **A2**, we get:
  - **B3**: The counterparty knew the agent lacked authority.
  - **B4**: The counterparty was negligent in not knowing about the lack of authority.
- From **A3**:
  - **B5**: The agent's legal capacity to act was restricted.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

- **A1 supports R1**: If the agent lacks authority, they are liable unless proven otherwise.
- **A2 denies R1**: If the counterparty knew or should have known about the lack of authority, it affects the agent's liability.
- **A3 denies R1**: Restrictions on the agent's capacity can negate their liability.

### Directed Links Explanation

- A support link from **A1 to R1** means that if an agent lacks authority, they are generally liable for the contract's performance or damages, supporting the root conclusion.
- Deny links from **A2 to R1** and **A3 to R1** indicate scenarios where the agent's liability might be negated due to the counterparty's knowledge/negligence or restrictions on the agent's capacity.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria

The structure adheres to the criteria by having a clear root node, single directed linkages, representation of context and relationships, and following the node naming convention. Links are represented as either supporting or denying relationships between factors.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "If an unauthorized agent is unable to obtain the ratification of the principal, the counterparty who did not know and without negligence in not knowing that the agent had no authority of agency claim damages against him/her."

- The query entails **B1** (the agent had no actual authority) and **B2** (the principal did not ratify the contract).
- It also implies a scenario where **B3** (the counterparty knew) is false, and **B4** (the counterparty was negligent) is also false because they were without negligence.
- The query agrees with **R1**, as it discusses a situation where an unauthorized agent's liability for damages is considered due to the lack of authority and no ratification by the principal.

### Justification

The query directly relates to base-level factors **B1** and **B2**, considering a scenario where the agent lacks authority and cannot obtain ratification. It also aligns with the conditions under which **R1** applies, as it involves an unauthorized agent and a non-negligent counterparty seeking damages.

### Re-Justification

Upon reevaluation, the analysis holds because the query specifically addresses scenarios covered by **B1**, **B2**, and indirectly touches upon the conditions of **A2** (counterparty's knowledge/negligence) by stating the counterparty was without negligence. The agreement with **R1** is justified as both the query and **R1** concern the liability of an unauthorized agent under similar conditions.

### Output

- (query entails B1)
- (query agrees R1)

This analysis demonstrates how the ANGELIC structure can be applied to legal provisions to understand and justify queries based on specific scenarios and legal principles.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 113 is that a contract concluded by an unauthorized agent does not bind the principal unless the principal ratifies it. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A principal is bound by a contract concluded by an unauthorized agent if and only if the principal ratifies it.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The principal's ratification of the contract.
- **A2**: The lack of authority of the agent to represent the principal.
- **A3**: The knowledge of the counterparty regarding the ratification or refusal to ratify.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
From **A1**:
- **B1**: The principal's explicit ratification of the contract made to the counterparty.
- **B2**: The principal's implicit ratification through actions or inactions that imply acceptance of the contract.

From **A2**:
- **B3**: The agent acted without any authority from the principal.
- **B4**: The agent exceeded their authority in concluding the contract.

From **A3**:
- **B5**: The counterparty was informed of the ratification or refusal to ratify by the principal directly.
- **B6**: The counterparty became aware of the ratification or refusal to ratify through other means.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **A1 supports R1**: Ratification by the principal binds them to the contract, supporting the root conclusion.
- **A2 denies R1**: Lack of authority negates the binding effect unless ratified, thus denying the automatic binding effect described in R1 without ratification.
- **A3 supports A1**: Knowledge of ratification by the counterparty is necessary for the ratification to be effective against them, supporting the condition under which A1 binds the principal.

Given the query: "Even if a principal ratified the act of unauthorized agency against the unauthorized agent, the principal may not assert the ratification vis-a-vis even the unauthorized agent."

### Analysis
- The query entails **B2** because it considers a scenario where the principal's actions (ratifying against the unauthorized agent) could imply acceptance or rejection of the contract's effects, which is akin to implicit ratification through actions.
- However, upon closer examination, the query seems to misunderstand the legal principle as outlined in Article 113. The article primarily discusses the relationship between the principal, the agent, and the counterparty, focusing on when a contract binds the principal (upon ratification). The query's focus on asserting ratification "vis-a-vis" the unauthorized agent introduces confusion because the primary concern of Article 113 is the binding effect of contracts on principals through ratification, not the assertion of ratification against agents.

### Justification
- **(query entails B2)**: Because it involves a scenario where actions might imply ratification, which aligns with the concept of implicit ratification.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query seems to suggest that even with ratification (which should bind the principal according to R1), there's a scenario where the principal may not assert this ratification against the agent. However, R1 focuses on when a contract binds a principal due to ratification, not the assertion of ratification against an unauthorized agent.

Upon re-justification, considering the complexities and focusing strictly on the provided information:
- The query indeed touches upon scenarios involving ratification and its implications but introduces a nuance (assertion against the agent) not directly addressed by Article 113's straightforward binding effect through ratification.
- Therefore, the initial analysis stands with a nuanced understanding that the query's disagreement with R1 might stem from a misunderstanding of the legal principles as outlined in Article 113.

### Final Output
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

This output reflects the complex relationship between the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure, highlighting both the entailed base-level factor and the disagreement with the root node due to the nuanced scenario presented in the query.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to analyze the given query, we'll follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 648, in relation to the query about a mandatary's ability to claim remuneration before performance in a quasi-mandate contract, seeks to establish that a mandatary may not claim remuneration from a mandator before performance, even with special agreements. Thus, the Root Node (R1) can be stated as: "A mandatary cannot claim remuneration before performing the mandated business."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract Factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The absence of special agreements regarding remuneration.
- A2: The presence of special agreements allowing for remuneration before performance.
- A3: The nature of the mandate contract, including quasi-mandate contracts.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
From A1:
- B1: No special agreement exists regarding payment timing.
From A2:
- B2: Special agreements allow for pre-performance remuneration claims.
From A3:
- B3: The contract is a quasi-mandate, which may have different implications for remuneration.

Each of these Base-Level Factors supports its respective Abstract Factor. For example, (B1 supports A1), (B2 supports A2), and (B3 supports A3).

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- A1 supports R1 because the absence of special agreements means the mandatary cannot claim remuneration before performance.
- A2 denies R1 since special agreements could allow for pre-performance claims, contradicting the root's statement.
- A3's impact depends on specific contract terms but generally supports R1 in the context of quasi-mandate contracts not typically allowing for pre-performance remuneration without explicit agreement.

### Analysis of Query
Given the query: "A mandatary of a quasi-mandate contract may not claim remuneration from a mandator before performance, even with special agreements that a mandatary may claim remuneration before he/she administers the mandated business."

- The query entails B2 because it considers a scenario where there are special agreements regarding pre-performance remuneration claims.
- However, the query's conclusion aligns more closely with the conditions described under A1 and the implications of A3 for quasi-mandate contracts, suggesting that despite special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration before performance.

### Justification
Upon initial analysis, it seems there might be a disagreement because the query suggests special agreements do not override the general rule against pre-performance claims. However, upon reevaluation:
- The query directly addresses a scenario where special agreements are present but concludes that the mandatary still cannot claim remuneration before performance.
- This conclusion aligns with R1's statement that a mandatary cannot claim remuneration before performing the mandated business, considering the nuances of quasi-mandate contracts and the specifics of special agreements.

### Conclusion
(query entails B2), because it discusses scenarios involving special agreements for pre-performance claims. 
(query agree R1), since both conclude that a mandatary cannot claim remuneration before performance under the described conditions, aligning with the general principle stated in R1 despite the presence of special agreements.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B2), (query agree R1)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 605-4 seeks to establish that if the lessee of immovables satisfies the requirements for perfection, the lessee may seek specific remedies against a third party. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: The lessee of immovables may demand remedies against a third party if the lessee satisfies the requirements for perfection.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion in R1 include:
- A1: Satisfaction of the requirements for perfection by the lessee.
- A2: The nature of the disturbance or possession by the third party.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
From A1 and A2, we can derive more specific base-level factors:
- B1 (child of A1): The lessee has satisfied all necessary legal requirements for perfection.
- B2 (child of A2): A third party is in possession of the immovables without legitimate title.
- B3 (child of A2): A third party disturbs the lessee's possession of the immovables.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (B3 supports A2)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination:
- (A1 supports R1): Satisfaction of perfection requirements supports the lessee's right to demand remedies.
- (A2 supports R1): The nature of the disturbance or possession by a third party supports the need for the lessee to seek remedies.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "If the lessee of immovables satisfies the requirements for perfection, the lessee may demand that a third party return the immovables when the third party is in possession of the immovables without legitimate title."

This query directly aligns with B2 (a third party is in possession of the immovables without legitimate title) and implies satisfaction of A1 (satisfaction of the requirements for perfection). Thus, the query entails base-level factor B2.

### Agreement with Root
The query agrees with R1 because it presents a scenario where the lessee, having satisfied the requirements for perfection, seeks a remedy against a third party in possession without legitimate title. This is consistent with the legal conclusion established by Article 605-4 and represented by R1.

Therefore:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

37 correct 17 wrongs 54 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) represents the outcome or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 32, the root node can be identified as:
- R1: The declaration of disappearance can be rescinded if proof is found that a missing person is alive or died at a different time.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion of the root node.
- A1: Receipt of proof that a missing person is alive or died at a different time.
- A2: Performance of acts in good faith after the declaration but before rescission.
- A3: Acquisition of property due to a declaration of disappearance.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are specific conditions or scenarios that substantiate the abstract factors.
- B1 (supports A1): Proof is found that a missing person who was declared dead is actually alive.
- B2 (supports A2): Acts performed in good faith after declaration but before rescission include legal transactions related to the missing person's property.
- B3 (supports A3): Property acquisition occurs due to inheritance following a declaration of death.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root node or other abstract factors.
- A1 supports R1: Finding proof that a missing person is alive directly supports rescinding the declaration of disappearance.
- A2 supports R1: Acts performed in good faith after the declaration but before rescission validate the process, supporting the potential for rescission without affecting those acts' validity.
- A3 denies R1: If property has been acquired due to the declaration, rescission might be complicated by the need to return that property, potentially denying or complicating the straightforward rescission of the declaration.

### Applying the ANGELIC Structure to the Query
Given the query: "In the case where, after the adjudication of disappearance had been made with respect to A and A had been deemed to have died because it had not been clear whether A had been dead or alive for 7 years, A was found to be alive, but the adjudication of disappearance was not rescinded and A died, the adjudication of disappearance may no longer be rescinded."

- **Justification with Base-Level Factors**: The query entails B1 because both involve a situation where proof is found that a missing person declared dead is actually alive.
  - (query entails B1)
  
- **Agreement with Root Node**: Considering R1, the query presents a scenario where the declaration of disappearance could be rescinded if A were found alive. However, since A died without the adjudication being rescinded, it introduces complexity regarding whether the declaration can still be rescinded after A's death.
  - Initially, it might seem that the query disagrees with R1 because it suggests a situation where rescission might not be possible due to subsequent events (A's death).
  
- **Rejustification**: Upon closer examination, the core issue is whether the adjudication of disappearance can be rescinded after the person is found alive but then dies before any action is taken. The article implies that the critical factor for rescission is proof of being alive or a different time of death. However, it does not explicitly address what happens if the person dies afterward without the declaration being rescinded.
  
  - Given this interpretation challenge and focusing strictly on the provided framework and query:
    - (query entails B1)
    - The agreement with R1 is nuanced due to the complexity introduced by A's subsequent death. However, based on the direct application of Article 32 without considering potential legal implications beyond its scope, one might argue that the query initially seems to disagree with the straightforward application of R1 because it introduces a scenario not directly addressed by the article.
    - (query disagree R1), but this disagreement is based on an interpretation that extends beyond the explicit conditions outlined in Article 32.

This analysis demonstrates how the ANGELIC structure can be applied to legal provisions and queries, facilitating a systematic approach to evaluating complex legal scenarios.

38 correct 17 wrongs 55 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, let's break it down into steps and construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. 
- **Root Node (R1):** A partner may not seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion.
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The general principle that partnership properties cannot be divided before liquidation, as stated in Article 676(3).
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Exceptions to the general principle, such as consent from the majority of partners.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

We derive base-level factors by specifying conditions under which the abstract factors apply.
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** In the absence of any exceptions, a partner cannot seek division before liquidation. (Supports A1)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** With the consent of the majority of partners, a partner may be able to seek division before liquidation, acting as an exception to the general rule. (Supports A2)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links

Each abstract factor must either support or deny the root determination.
- **Link:** A1 supports R1, because it validates the principle that partnership properties cannot be divided before liquidation.
- **Link:** A2 denies R1, because it introduces an exception where division might be possible with majority consent.

Given these steps, we have:
- **Root Node (R1):** A partner may not seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation.
- **Abstract Factors:** 
  - **A1:** General principle against pre-liquidation division.
  - **A2:** Exception for majority consent.
- **Base-Level Factors:**
  - **B1:** No division without exceptions.
  - **B2:** Division possible with majority consent.

### Justification of Query Entailment

The query states, "A partner may seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation if the consent of the majority of partners exists." This scenario aligns with **Base-Level Factor (B2)** because both consider a situation where the general rule against pre-liquidation division might be exceptioned due to specific conditions (in this case, majority consent).

Therefore, **(query entails B2)**.

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root

The query presents a scenario that directly contradicts the root node's statement. The root node asserts that a partner may not seek division before liquidation, while the query suggests there is an exception (with majority consent) where this could be possible.

Thus, **(query disagree R1)**.

Upon re-justification, considering the structure and links established:
- The presence of an exception (majority consent) directly challenges the absolute nature of the root's statement.
- The existence of such exceptions is what base-level factor B2 is based on, supporting abstract factor A2 which in turn denies or provides a condition under which R1 does not hold.

Therefore, the initial conclusion that **(query entails B2)** and **(query disagree R1)** remains justified upon further review.

39 correct 17 wrongs 56 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 676(2), the root node can be identified as:
- R1: A partner may not independently exercise the rights with regard to a claim that is included in the partnership property based on that partner's interest in the claim.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion. For Article 676(2), we can derive:
- A1: The principle of joint ownership in partnership property, which suggests that partners have shared interests and rights.
- A2: The limitation on individual partners' ability to act independently regarding partnership claims.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are specific conditions or scenarios that either validate or invalidate the abstract factors. For A1 and A2:
- B1 (child of A1): When a claim is explicitly included in the partnership property, partners have joint rights.
- B2 (child of A2): Partners are restricted from independently exercising rights on claims within the partnership property without consent.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root node or other abstract factors. We have:
- A1 supports R1, because joint ownership implies shared decision-making.
- A2 supports R1, as it directly states the limitation on independent action by partners.
- There are no denying links in this context since both abstract factors align with the root conclusion.

Given the query: "A partner may independently exercise the rights with regard to a monetary claim that is included in the partnership property in proportion to each co-owner's interest."

### Justification
The query seems to contradict the spirit of Article 676(2) as it suggests independent action by a partner, which is restricted by the article. However, let's analyze if the query entails any base-level factors or agrees/disagrees with the root.

- The query does entail B2 because both consider scenarios where a partner's action regarding a claim within the partnership property is in question. However, they differ in their conclusions about independent action.
  
- Therefore, (query entails B2).

Given that R1 concludes partners may not independently exercise rights, and the query suggests they can under certain conditions:
- The query disagrees with R1 because it proposes an exception (in proportion to each co-owner's interest) not accounted for by Article 676(2).
  
- Therefore, (query disagree R1).

Upon rejustification, considering the specific language of both the article and the query, the conclusion remains that while the query pertains to a similar scenario as B2, it fundamentally disagrees with the root node's verdict regarding independent action on partnership claims.

Output:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

40 correct 17 wrongs 57 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process step by step according to the ANGELIC structure formation criteria.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should represent the main legal conclusion or verdict that we are trying to establish or refute based on the provided articles. Given the context, a possible root node could be:
- **R1**: An additional obligor resulting from the assumption of obligation not releasing an old obligor has the right to demand reimbursement from the initial obligor for the proportion to the initial obligor's shares of the obligation after performing the assumed obligation.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion. Based on the provided articles, we can identify:
- **A1**: The assumption of obligation not releasing an old obligor results in joint and several liability among obligors.
- **A2**: Performance by one obligor entitles them to reimbursement from other joint and several obligors.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are more specific conditions or scenarios that fall under the abstract factors. For A1 and A2, we could have:
- **B1** (under A1): The assumption of obligation not releasing an old obligor is made through a contract between the obligee and the new obligor.
- **B2** (under A1): The assumption of obligation not releasing an old obligor is made through a contract between the initial obligor and the new obligor, with consent from the obligee.
- **B3** (under A2): Reimbursement includes compensation for property expended to obtain discharge.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- **Support Link**: B1 supports A1, because it specifies one scenario under which joint and several liability is established. Similarly, B2 supports A1, and B3 supports A2.
- **Deny/Attack Link**: None explicitly mentioned in this context, as we are primarily focusing on supportive relationships for the query's context.

Given these steps and the provided articles, let's address the query:
"When an additional obligor resulting from the assumption of obligation not releasing an old obligor performed the assumed obligation, the additional obligor may demand reimbursement from the initial obligor for the proportion to the initial obligor’s shares of the obligation."

### Justification
- The query **entails B3**, because it considers a scenario where performance by one obligor (the additional obligor) leads to a right to reimbursement, which aligns with the concept of compensation for property expended to obtain discharge.
- The query **agrees with R1**, as both state that an additional obligor has the right to demand reimbursement from the initial obligor after performing the obligation. This is based on the principle of joint and several liability and the right to reimbursement among obligors.

Therefore, the output format for this analysis would be:
- (query entails B3)
- (query agrees R1)

 entail(query, node(bfactor(3))).agree(query, node(root(1))).
true label: Y  - predicted label: N
40 correct 18 wrongs 58 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node is determined by answering the question of what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. In this case, the article establishes that either party in a lease with an indefinite term may give notice of termination at any time.

- **Root Node (R1):** Either party can terminate a lease with an indefinite term at any time.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The abstract factors are identified by considering what legal conditions or principles validate or invalidate the conclusion that either party can terminate such a lease at any time.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The lease has an indefinite term.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Either party gives notice of termination.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Base-level factors are derived from abstract factors, specifying conditions or scenarios where the abstract factor applies.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1) from A1:** The lease agreement does not specify a fixed term.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) from A2:** The notice of termination is given in accordance with legal requirements (e.g., proper timing and form).

### 4. Establish Directed Links

Directed links connect abstract factors to the root node or to other abstract factors, indicating whether they support or deny the legal conclusion.

- **Support Link:** (A1 supports R1) because having an indefinite term is a condition that allows for termination at any time.
- **Support Link:** (A2 supports R1) because giving notice of termination is the action that leads to the lease's termination.
- No abstract factor denies R1 in this context since both A1 and A2 are conditions that lead to the conclusion established by R1.

### Applying ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria

Given the query: "In the case of a lease of movables with an indefinite term, the lessor may give a notice of termination at any time."

- The query entails **Base-Level Factor (B1)** because both consider a scenario involving a lease with an indefinite term.
  
- Since **R1** states that either party can terminate such a lease and the query specifies that the lessor (one of the parties) may give notice of termination, we can conclude that:
  
  - The query agrees with **Root Node (R1)** in a comparable situation, as it specifies a condition under which one of the parties (the lessor) can terminate the lease.

Thus, following the output format:

- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

Upon rejustification, considering the specificity of the query towards the lessor's ability to terminate and comparing it with the broader statement in **R1** that either party can do so, the initial conclusion holds because the query provides a specific instance that aligns with the general principle stated by **R1**.

40 correct 19 wrongs 59 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, we will follow the structured approach outlined in the problem statement.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by answering the question: What legal conclusion or verdict does the article seek to establish or refute? 
- **Root Node (R1):** In cases where the party ordering work is subject to a ruling for the commencement of bankruptcy procedures, the contractor may cancel the contract.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion.
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The right to cancel a contract due to bankruptcy proceedings.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Limitations on cancellation rights after work completion.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Participation in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate for completed work and expenses.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Base-level factors specify conditions under which abstract factors apply.
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** If the party ordering work receives an order commencing bankruptcy proceedings before the work is completed, the contractor may cancel the contract. (Supports A1)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The cancellation right does not apply if the work is already completed when the bankruptcy proceeding starts. (Supports A2)
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Contractors can participate in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate for remuneration of completed work and expenses. (Supports A3)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root determination.
- **A1 supports R1:** The right to cancel due to bankruptcy proceedings directly supports the conclusion that a contractor may cancel the contract in such situations.
- **A2 denies R1:** Limitations on cancellation rights after work completion could negate the general rule, suggesting not all cases allow for cancellation.
- **A3 supports R1:** Participation in the distribution of the bankruptcy estate indirectly supports the contractor's right to cancel by providing a mechanism for compensation.

### Applying the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the query: "In cases where the party ordering work is subject to a ruling for the commencement of bankruptcy procedures, the contractor may cancel the contract."
- The query directly relates to **Base-Level Factor (B1)** because it discusses the scenario where bankruptcy proceedings commence before work completion.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1).**
- Since B1 supports A1, and A1 in turn supports R1, the query aligns with the root node's conclusion that the contractor may cancel the contract under specified conditions.
- Hence, **(query agrees R1).**

Upon rejustification, considering the provided legal provisions and the constructed ANGELIC structure:
- The query indeed aligns with the scenario described in B1, which supports the contractor's right to cancel the contract upon commencement of bankruptcy proceedings against the party ordering work.
- This alignment means the query and R1 present a consistent verdict regarding the contractor's cancellation rights under bankruptcy conditions.

Thus, the final output remains:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agrees R1)**

40 correct 20 wrongs 60 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 306 and Article 308 can be summarized into a root node that states: An employee has a statutory lien over the entire assets of the employer for unpaid salaries.

- **Root Node (R1):** An employee has a statutory lien on the company's property for unpaid salary.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Existence of an employer-employee relationship.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The nature of the claim (in this case, unpaid salary).
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Applicability of statutory lien provisions.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The employer-employee relationship is established at the time of the unpaid salary.
    - **Support Link:** (B1 supports A1)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The claim is for unpaid salary, which arises from the employment relationship.
    - **Support Link:** (B2 supports A2)
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The statutory lien provisions apply to claims for unpaid salaries.
    - **Support Link:** (B3 supports A3)

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **Support Link:** (A1 supports R1) - An established employer-employee relationship supports the employee's claim for a statutory lien.
- **Support Link:** (A2 supports R1) - The nature of the claim being for unpaid salary, which directly relates to the employment relationship, supports the employee's claim.
- **Support Link:** (A3 supports R1) - The applicability of statutory lien provisions to such claims further supports the employee's right to a lien.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "If a company does not pay salary, the employee shall have a statutory lien with respect to the salary, regardless of the unpaid period, over the entire property of the company."

- **Entails Base-Level Factor:** (query entails B2) because both consider scenarios involving unpaid salaries.
- **Agreement with Root Node:** (query agree R1) since both conclude that an employee has a statutory lien on the company's property for unpaid salary.

Upon reevaluation, considering the specific language and intent of Articles 306 and 308, it's clear that the query directly aligns with the principles outlined in these articles, particularly focusing on the employer-employee relationship and the nature of claims such as unpaid salaries.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the steps outlined below:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 715 is to establish that an employer is liable for damage inflicted by their employee during the execution of a business undertaking, unless certain conditions are met.

- **Root Node (R1):** An employer is liable for damages caused by their employees in the course of business.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- The exercise of reasonable care by the employer in appointing the employee.
- The exercise of reasonable supervision over the business by the employer.
- The unavoidable nature of the damage despite reasonable care.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Exercise of reasonable care in appointment and supervision.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Unavoidability of damage despite reasonable care.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factors, we derive:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Employer exercised reasonable care in appointing the employee.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Employer exercised reasonable supervision over the business.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Damage could not have been avoided even with reasonable care.

Each of these Base-Level Factors supports its respective Abstract Factor:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A1)
- (B3 supports A2)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
Abstract Factors either support or deny the Root determination:
- **(A1 denies R1):** If an employer exercised reasonable care, they are not liable.
- **(A2 denies R1):** If the damage was unavoidable, the employer is not liable.

### Analysis of Query and ANGELIC Structure
Given query: "The employer is released from his/her liability in cases when proof is provided that the employer made proper care regarding the appointment and supervision of the employee."

- **Query entails B1:** Because both the query and B1 consider scenarios where the employer's proper care (in appointment and supervision) leads to a release from liability.
- **Query entails B2:** Implicitly, as "proper care" would include supervision.

### Justification of Query and Root Agreement
The query essentially states that with proof of proper care in appointment and supervision, the employer is not liable. This directly aligns with the conditions under which an employer would not be held liable according to Article 715.

- **Query agree R1:** In the context where proper care is demonstrated (entailing B1 and implicitly B2), the query supports the conclusion that the employer is not liable, which is a condition negating the liability as stated in R1. However, it's critical to note this agreement is under specific circumstances outlined by the query.

### Re-Justification
Upon reevaluation, considering the structure and the implications:
- The query indeed entails Base-Level Factors related to proper care (B1 and implicitly B2).
- The agreement with the Root Node (R1) should be understood in the context of the conditions that negate liability. Thus, the query aligns with scenarios where the employer's actions lead to a negation of their liability as per R1.

The final answer is: 
$\boxed{(query entails B1)}$

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to analyze the given query in relation to this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 484(1), the root node can be formulated as:

- **R1**: The delivery of a specific thing must be effected at the place where that thing was located when the relevant claim accrued, unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the place where the performance should take place.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion of the root node. From Article 484(1), we can derive:

- **A1**: The absence of a particular intention manifested with respect to the place where the performance should take place.
- **A2**: The location of the thing when the relevant claim accrued.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Base-level factors are specific conditions or scenarios that fall under the abstract factors. For A1 and A2:

- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: No specification by the parties regarding the delivery location.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: The thing was located at a specific place (e.g., the domicile of one of the parties) when the claim arose.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination. Here:

- **A1 supports R1**: Because if there's no particular intention regarding the delivery place, the default rule applies.
- **A2 supports R1**: As it specifies where the thing should be delivered according to the article.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "Unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the place where the performance should take place, even if X was located at the domicile of D at the time of the conclusion of contract for sale, the delivery of X must be effected at the current domicile of B."

This query entails **B1** because it involves a scenario where there's no particular intention regarding the delivery location specified by the parties. However, it seems to contradict the principle established in R1 by suggesting delivery should occur at the current domicile of the buyer (B), not necessarily where X was located when the claim arose.

- **(query entails B1)**

Regarding agreement with the root node R1:

The query essentially disagrees with R1 because it suggests a different default location for delivery (the current domicile of B) than what is stated in Article 484(1) (where the thing was located when the relevant claim accrued).

- **(query disagree R1)**

### Rejustification

Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure:

1. The query indeed aligns with the absence of a specified intention regarding delivery location (**B1**), hence it entails **B1**.
2. However, the core disagreement lies in where the delivery should occur by default. The article clearly states that in the absence of a particular intention, delivery should be at the place where the thing was located when the claim arose, not necessarily at the current domicile of the buyer.

Thus, the initial analysis stands:

- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

This conclusion is based on understanding that the query presents a scenario that fits within the conditions described by **B1** but proposes a delivery location that contradicts the main principle outlined in **R1**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 234 seeks to establish that after a year lapses from the time when construction started, or if the building has been completed, the owner of the adjacent land may not demand changes to the building and may only claim damages.

- **Root Node (R1)**: The owner of the adjacent land may only claim damages and cannot demand changes to the building after a year lapses from the start of construction or upon completion of the building.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion are:

- **Abstract Factor (A1)**: The requirement for a building to be distanced 50 centimeters or more away from the boundary line.
- **Abstract Factor (A2)**: The passage of one year from the start of construction or the completion of the building.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

From Abstract Factor A1, we can derive:

- **Base-Level Factor (B1)**: Construction violates the boundary distance requirement before a year passes.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2)**: The owner of the neighboring land requests suspension or change of construction within the first year.

From Abstract Factor A2, we directly have:

- **Base-Level Factor (B3)**: One year has passed since the start of construction, or the building is completed.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

- **Abstract Factor (A1) denies Root Node (R1)**: Because if the construction violates the boundary requirement within the first year, the owner can still demand changes.
- **Abstract Factor (A2) supports Root Node (R1)**: Since after a year passes or upon completion, the owner can only claim damages.

Given this structure:

### Justification

The query states that after a year lapses from the time when such construction started, or if that building has been completed, the owner of the adjacent land may not demand changes to the building and may only claim damages. This scenario matches **Base-Level Factor (B3)** because it considers the situation where one year has passed since the start of construction or the building is completed.

Therefore: **(query entails B3)**

Considering the Root Node (R1), which states that after a year lapses from the start of construction or upon completion of the building, the owner of the adjacent land may not demand changes to the building and may only claim damages, we see that the query agrees with R1.

Therefore: **(query agree R1)**

Upon re-justification, considering the details provided in the query and how they align with Base-Level Factor (B3) and the conclusion presented in Root Node (R1), it's clear that the initial justification was correct. The query does indeed entail B3 and agrees with R1.

Final Output:
- **(query entails B3)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process into the required steps for constructing the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then relate it to the query.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 467, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The assignment of a claim may not be duly asserted against the obligor unless the assignor gives notice thereof to the obligor or the obligor has consented to the same.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion. From Article 467, we can derive:
- **A1**: The requirement for notice or consent from the obligor for the assignment of a claim to be valid against them.
- **A2**: The necessity of using an instrument bearing a certified date for notice or consent to be effective against third parties other than the obligor.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are more specific conditions that stem from abstract factors. For A1 and A2:
- **B1** (from A1): The assignor must give explicit notice to the obligor for the assignment to be valid.
- **B2** (from A1): The obligor's consent can validate the assignment without needing notice.
- **B3** (from A2): For third parties, the notice or consent must be in a form with a certified date to be considered.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root node or other abstract factors. Since our focus is on whether an obligor can refuse an assignment demand without proof of no notification or consent:
- **A1 supports R1**: Because if notice or consent is required for validity, then lack of it would invalidate the assignment against the obligor.
- **A2 supports A1**: In that proper form (certified date) strengthens the validity of notice or consent, indirectly supporting the root by specifying conditions under which assignments can be valid.

### Relating to the Query
The query states: "If the assignee of a claim demands the obligor to execute the assignment of the claim, in order for the obligor to refuse this, he/she is not required to demonstrate proof that there was no notification or consent regarding the claim assignment."

- **(query entails B1)**: Because both deal with the necessity of notice for the validity of an assignment against the obligor.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query and R1 are aligned in that they both imply conditions (like notice or consent) must be met for an assignment to be validly asserted against the obligor. The query suggests the onus is not on the obligor to prove lack of notice or consent to refuse, which aligns with the principle that such assignments require notice or consent to be valid.

Upon rejustification, considering the context and relationships defined:
- The structure emphasizes the importance of notice or consent for the validity of claim assignments against obligors.
- The query specifically touches on the procedural aspect of refusing an assignment demand, highlighting that the obligor's refusal does not necessitate proof of no prior notification or consent.

Thus, the final assessment remains that the query aligns with the principles established by the root node and its supporting factors regarding the validity and assertion of claim assignments against obligors.

43 correct 22 wrongs 65 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict of Article 478. The article states that a performance made to someone who appears to be authorized but is not, is effective only if done in good faith and without negligence. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: Performance to an unauthorized person is effective if done in good faith and without negligence.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion of R1. Based on Article 478, we can identify:
- A1: Good faith of the performer.
- A2: Absence of negligence by the performer.
- A3: Appearance of authority to accept performance.

These abstract factors support the effectiveness of the performance under certain conditions.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From the abstract factors, we can derive more specific base-level factors:
- B1 (child of A1): The performer believes in good faith that the recipient is authorized.
- B2 (child of A2): The performer takes reasonable care to verify the recipient's authority.
- B3 (child of A3): The recipient's appearance of authority is based on common sense in transactions.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination. Here, all identified abstract factors support R1 because they are conditions under which the performance is considered effective:
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1
- A3 supports R1

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "A bearer of a receipt, regardless of the subjective conditions of the performer regarding that person's authority, is deemed to have the authority to accept performance."

This query seems to focus on the objective appearance of authority (similar to B3) rather than the subjective good faith or negligence of the performer. It implies that having a receipt is sufficient to be considered authorized for the purpose of accepting performance, which aligns with the concept of "appearance of authority" discussed in A3 and its base-level factor B3.

### Justification
- The query entails B3 because both consider the appearance of authority based on objective criteria (in this case, being a bearer of a receipt).
- Since B3 supports A3, and A3 supports R1, we can infer that the query indirectly supports R1 by affirming one of its underlying conditions (appearance of authority).

### Agreement with Root
Given that the query entails B3 and thus supports the conditions under which performance is effective according to Article 478, it agrees with the root node R1. The query does not introduce any factors that would deny or negate the effectiveness of the performance as outlined in R1.

### Final Justification
After careful consideration, the justification stands that the query aligns with the base-level factor B3 and, by extension, supports the root node R1. This is because both the query and B3 focus on the objective criteria for determining authority to accept performance, which is a crucial condition for the effectiveness of such performance as per Article 478.

### Output
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The article states that "A partner's creditor may not exercise the rights of that creditor against the partnership property." This establishes a clear legal conclusion or verdict. Thus, the root node can be defined as:

- **R1**: A partner's creditor cannot exercise their rights against the partnership property.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

To substantiate or undermine this legal conclusion, we identify key legal factors:

- **A1**: Legal principles protecting partnership property from individual creditors.
- **A2**: The distinction between personal and partnership liabilities.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion by addressing the legal conditions or principles that govern how a partner's creditor can act in relation to partnership property.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

Breaking down the abstract factors into base-level factors:

- From **A1**, we get:
  - **B1**: The principle that partnership assets are used first to satisfy partnership debts.
  - **B2**: Legal protections preventing direct access to partnership property by individual creditors.

- From **A2**, we have:
  - **B3**: The legal separation of a partner's personal assets and liabilities from those of the partnership.

Each base-level factor has a support link to its abstract parent. For example, **B1 supports A1** and **B2 supports A1**, indicating that these principles validate the protection of partnership property.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors

- **A1 supports R1**: The legal principles protecting partnership property support the conclusion that a partner's creditor cannot exercise their rights against it.
- **A2 supports R1**: Understanding the distinction between personal and partnership liabilities also supports this conclusion.

Given the query: "An obligor of a partnership cannot set off his/her obligation against his/her claim against the partners."

### Justification

The query essentially discusses the inability to offset obligations against claims in a specific context, which aligns with the principles protecting partnership property from individual actions by creditors or obligors. 

- **(query entails B1)**: The scenario considers a situation where an obligor's actions (setting off their obligation) are limited by their relationship to the partnership, similar to how **B1** discusses the priority of using partnership assets for partnership debts.
  
- **(query agree R1)**: Both the query and **R1** conclude that certain actions cannot be taken directly against partnership property or in relation to partners' personal liabilities without considering the partnership's legal status. This agreement is based on the understanding that both scenarios involve limitations on how individuals can exercise their rights in relation to a partnership.

Upon rejustification, it becomes clear that the initial analysis correctly identifies the relationship between the query and the established ANGELIC structure. The key insight is recognizing how the principles of protecting partnership property and distinguishing between personal and partnership liabilities underpin both the root conclusion and the scenario presented in the query. 

Thus, the final output remains consistent with the detailed step-by-step analysis provided.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this framework, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node (R) represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 715, the root node can be identified as:

- **R1**: An employer is liable to compensate for damage inflicted on a third party by their employee with respect to the execution of the business.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the main legal conclusion. From Article 715, we can derive:

- **A1**: The employer's exercise of reasonable care in appointing the employee or supervising the business.
- **A2**: The impossibility of avoiding the damage even with reasonable care.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)

Base-level factors are more specific conditions that fall under abstract factors. For A1 and A2:

- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The employer exercised reasonable care in appointing the employee.
  - **B2**: The employer exercised reasonable care in supervising the business.

- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: The damage was unavoidable despite reasonable care.

Each of these base-level factors supports its respective abstract factor. For example, B1 and B2 support A1, indicating scenarios where the employer's actions might exempt them from liability.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links

- **Support Link**: 
  - (B1 supports A1)
  - (B2 supports A1)
  - (B3 supports A2)

- **Deny/Attack Link**:
  - Since A1 and A2 both essentially provide conditions under which the employer might not be liable, they can be seen as denying or attacking the root liability conclusion R1 under specific circumstances.
  - (A1 denies R1)
  - (A2 denies R1)

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "Even in cases when the victim has proven that authority of supervision has been granted to the agent supervisor from the employer prior to the act of injury of the employee, if proof is provided that the agent supervisor exercised reasonable care to the appointment and supervision of the employee, the agent supervisor is released from liability."

- This query **entails B1** because it discusses a scenario where reasonable care has been taken (in this case, by the agent supervisor), which aligns with the conditions outlined in base-level factor B1.
  
- The query essentially agrees with the principle that exercising reasonable care can release one from liability. However, since our root node R1 is about the employer's liability and the query discusses the agent supervisor's liability under similar conditions of reasonable care, there might seem to be a slight mismatch in direct application.

- Upon closer examination, though, the query **agrees with R1** in spirit because both deal with the principle that liability can be mitigated by showing reasonable care. The query extends this principle to an agent supervisor, which is a logical extension of the liability principles outlined in Article 715.

### Conclusion

- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

After rejustifying, it's clear that while the query specifically talks about an agent supervisor, the underlying principle of liability and reasonable care aligns with both the base-level factors and the root node's conclusion regarding employer liability.

45 correct 23 wrongs 68 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that an act performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent of another person may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity, except when the act is performed as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: Acts performed by agents with qualified legal capacity cannot be rescinded based on their capacity.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The agent has qualified legal capacity.
- **A2**: The act was performed as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- **B1** (child of A1): The agent is a minor acting on behalf of another.
- **B2** (child of A2): The act was performed by a legal representative (e.g., guardian, trustee) for someone with qualified legal capacity.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination:
- **A1** generally supports **R1**, as having qualified legal capacity implies that acts performed in an agency role should not be rescinded based on capacity.
- **A2** denies **R1**, because if the act was performed as a legal representative of another with qualified legal capacity, it could potentially be subject to different rules regarding rescission.

Thus, we have:
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 denies R1)**

### Evaluation of Query Against ANGELIC Structure
Given query: "A privately appointed agent can be a minor, but acts of agency by a minor can be rescinded by the statutory agent."

This query directly pertains to scenarios where a minor (a person with limited or no qualified legal capacity in many jurisdictions) is acting as an agent. The key point here is that even though the query mentions a privately appointed agent being a minor, it specifies that acts of agency by a minor can be rescinded, which aligns more closely with exceptions to general rules about agents and their capacity.

- **(Query entails B1)** because both consider scenarios involving minors acting as agents.
  
Considering the root node **R1** and its statement that acts performed by agents with qualified legal capacity cannot be rescinded based on their capacity, the query seems to introduce a nuance or exception (involving minors and the potential for rescission by statutory agents), which could suggest disagreement under specific circumstances.

However, upon closer examination, the query actually highlights an exception rather than directly contradicting **R1**. The original article and thus **R1** primarily address agents with qualified legal capacity, with a specific exception mentioned. The query touches on a related but distinct issue involving minors (who typically do not have full qualified legal capacity) and the actions of statutory agents in their regard.

Therefore, after careful consideration:
- **(Query agree R1)** because while the query introduces nuances about minors acting as agents and potential rescissions by statutory agents, it does not directly contradict the core statement of **R1** regarding acts performed by agents with qualified legal capacity. The agreement here is based on understanding that the query and **R1** address related but distinct aspects of agency law, with the query focusing on exceptions or additional considerations rather than challenging the basic premise of **R1**.

Upon re-justification, this analysis holds as it correctly interprets the relationship between the query, base-level factors, and the root node within the context provided by the legal provisions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 415 is to establish when an obligee can claim compensation for loss or damage due to non-performance of an obligation by the obligor. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: The obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage arising from the failure of the obligor to perform the obligation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- A1: Failure to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation.
- A2: Impossibility of performance.
- A3: Grounds not attributable to the obligor (e.g., force majeure).

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A):
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific base-level factors, we get:
- B1 (child of A1): The obligor's failure is due to negligence.
- B2 (child of A2): The performance of the obligation has become objectively impossible.
- B3 (child of A3): The failure to perform is due to circumstances beyond the control of the obligor.

Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract parent:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factor:
The directed links are as follows:
- A1 supports R1: If the obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation, it supports the claim for compensation.
- A2 supports R1: If performance is impossible, it also supports the claim for compensation under certain conditions.
- A3 denies R1: If the failure is due to grounds not attributable to the obligor, it negates the claim for compensation.

Given the query: "If the lessee has lost the leased thing due to fire caused through negligence, the lessor may not demand compensation for damages unless the lessee has been with gross negligence."

### Justification:
- The query entails B1 because both consider a scenario where negligence (in this case, the lessee's) leads to loss or damage.
- Query entails B1.

Considering R1 and comparing it with the query:
- The root node R1 suggests that the obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage due to non-performance. However, the query specifies a condition (gross negligence) under which the lessor cannot demand compensation if the lessee's negligence was not gross.
- This implies a disagreement because R1 does not specify degrees of negligence as a condition for claiming compensation, whereas the query introduces a distinction based on the level of negligence.

Thus:
- Query disagree R1.

After rejustification, considering the nuances of the legal context and the specific conditions under which claims can be made, it's clear that the introduction of "gross negligence" in the query as a determining factor for compensation eligibility introduces a condition not explicitly covered by R1. Therefore, the initial assessment stands:
- Query entails B1.
- Query disagree R1.

Output format aligned with instructions:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, let's construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the query in relation to this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R1) is determined by the outcome of Article 94(1), which states that a false manifestation of intention made in collusion between two parties is void. Thus, R1 can be formulated as:
- R1: A false manifestation of intention between two parties is legally void.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
From Article 94, we derive the following abstract factors:
- A1: The nullity of a manifestation of intention due to collusion.
- A2: The protection of third parties in good faith from the nullity of such manifestations.

These abstract factors either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion regarding the voidness of a false manifestation of intention.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down A1 and A2 into more specific scenarios:
- B1 (child of A1): The manifestation of intention is made with the intent to deceive.
- B2 (child of A2): A third party acquires rights without knowledge of the collusion.

Each base-level factor has a support link to its abstract parent. For instance, B1 supports A1 because it specifies a condition under which the nullity of the manifestation of intention is evident.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- A1 supports R1 because it directly relates to the voidness of the false manifestation.
- A2 denies A1 when considering third parties, as it introduces a condition where the nullity may not be asserted against them in good faith.

### Constructed ANGELIC Structure:
- R1: A false manifestation of intention between two parties is legally void.
- A1: The nullity of a manifestation of intention due to collusion. (Supports R1)
  - B1: The manifestation of intention is made with the intent to deceive. (Supports A1)
- A2: The protection of third parties in good faith from the nullity of such manifestations. (Denies A1 when considering third parties)
  - B2: A third party acquires rights without knowledge of the collusion. (Supports A2)

### Query Analysis:
The query describes a scenario where A and B conspire to sell Land X, and after transferring ownership through B to C and then to D, A attempts to assert the invalidity of the original sale against D, despite D's potential lack of knowledge about the falsification.

- (Query entails B2) because it involves a third party (D) acquiring rights potentially without full knowledge of the initial collusion between A and B.
- Given the specifics of Article 94(2), which states that the nullity may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith, we must consider whether D's status as a good faith purchaser affects the outcome.

### Agreement with Root R1:
The query presents a complex scenario where the protection of third parties (A2) intersects with the voidness of false manifestations (R1). If D is considered to be in good faith, then according to Article 94(2), A may not assert the invalidity against D. This suggests that in the context provided by the query:
- (Query disagree R1) because the specific conditions involving third-party protection might override the general principle of voidness due to collusion.

Upon reevaluation, considering the nuances of the legal provisions and the ANGELIC structure, it becomes clear that the critical factor is whether D can be considered a third party in good faith. If so, then despite the initial false manifestation between A and B, A's ability to assert the invalidity against D might indeed be limited by Article 94(2), supporting the conclusion that there is disagreement with R1 under these specific circumstances.

Thus, after careful consideration:
- The query entails a base-level factor related to third-party acquisition in good faith (B2).
- There is a disagreement with the root node R1 due to the protection afforded to third parties in good faith, as outlined in Article 94(2).

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the articles seems to focus on the conditions under which a buyer can demand cure for non-conformity in performance or cancel a contract. Thus, a root node could be:
- R1: The buyer may cancel the contract due to non-conformity.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- A1: Non-conformity of performance due to grounds attributable to the seller.
- A2: Specification of a reasonable period for performance by the buyer before cancellation.
- A3: Impossibility of performance or clear intention to refuse performance by the seller.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factor A1:
- B1: Non-conformity due to insufficient quantity delivered, where the insufficiency is attributable to the seller.
- B2: Non-conformity due to quality issues, where the quality problem is attributable to the seller.

From Abstract Factor A2:
- B3: The buyer has specified a reasonable period for the seller to cure the non-conformity before demanding cancellation.

From Abstract Factor A3:
- B4: The performance of the obligation is impossible.
- B5: The seller clearly manifests an intention to refuse part of the obligation, making the contract's purpose unachievable.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- Support links:
  - (A1 supports R1) because non-conformity due to the seller's fault supports cancellation.
  - (A2 supports R1) as specifying a period for performance is a prerequisite for cancellation in some cases.
  - (A3 supports R1) since impossibility or clear refusal to perform supports immediate cancellation.

- Deny links:
  - (A3 denies A1) if the non-conformity is due to grounds not attributable to either party, it may negate the support of A1 for R1.

### Analysis of Query
The query states that in a sales contract between A and B, the quantity of the subject matter delivered by A to B is insufficient and does not conform to the terms of the contract. If the insufficiency in the quantity is due to grounds not attributable to either party, then:
- (query entails B1) is incorrect because B1 specifies the insufficiency is attributable to the seller.
- However, considering the essence of the query, it seems more aligned with a scenario where attribution is not clear or is shared/not applicable, thus potentially involving a denial or negation of support for cancellation based on seller's fault.

Given this, and looking at our structure:
- (query disagrees R1) because if the non-conformity (insufficient quantity) is due to grounds not attributable to either party, it suggests that the buyer may not have a clear case for cancellation based solely on the seller's fault or responsibility.

Justifying again with careful consideration:
- The query specifically mentions "grounds not attributable to either party," which aligns more closely with scenarios where immediate cancellation might not be justified purely based on non-conformity due to the seller's actions. This implies that while non-conformity exists, the reason for it (not being clearly the seller's fault) could affect the buyer's ability to cancel the contract directly because of this non-conformity.

Therefore, considering the nuances and the structure:
- The final assessment is: (query disagrees R1).

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, let's follow the steps outlined to construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the query against this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) represents the main legal conclusion or verdict established by Article 437. This article states that even if there are grounds for the invalidity or rescission of a juridical act with respect to one of the joint and several obligors, the validity of the obligation of other joint and several obligors is not impaired.

- **R1**: The validity of an obligation of one jointly and severally liable party is not affected by the potential invalidity or rescission of the contract for another jointly and severally liable party.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that either support or undermine the root conclusion. For Article 437, these could include:

- **A1**: The principle of joint and several liability, where each party is fully responsible for the obligation.
- **A2**: The concept of independent obligations among jointly and severally liable parties.
- **A3**: The legal grounds for invalidity or rescission of a juridical act (e.g., being an adult ward).

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors specify conditions under which abstract factors apply. For the given abstract factors:

- **B1** (child of A1): Each jointly and severally liable party is fully responsible for the debt, regardless of the other parties' situations.
- **B2** (child of A2): The obligation of one party does not depend on the validity or enforceability of the contract against another party.
- **B3** (child of A3): Being an adult ward can be a valid reason for rescinding a contract.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root conclusion or other abstract factors. 

- **A1 supports R1**: The principle of joint and several liability upholds that each party's obligation is independent.
- **A2 supports R1**: Independent obligations among jointly and severally liable parties mean one party's contract issues do not affect another's.
- **A3 denies A2**: If a contract is rescinded due to a party being an adult ward, it could imply their obligation is not independent of the others' validity.

### Evaluating the Query
Given the query about jointly borrowing 1,000,000 yen and one obligor rescinding the contract due to being an adult ward:

- **Query entails B2**: The scenario considers a situation where one party's reason for rescission (being an adult ward) does not necessarily invalidate the contract for other parties.
- **Query disagrees R1**: According to Article 437, the validity of the obligation of other jointly and several obligors should not be impaired by grounds for invalidity or rescission affecting one of them. However, the query suggests that the portion of the obligation of the adult ward is revoked, which could be seen as impacting the distribution of responsibility among the obligors but does not directly invalidate R1 since it speaks to the validity of obligations of other parties.

Upon reevaluation:
- The initial interpretation may have been too hasty in concluding disagreement with R1. Article 437 specifically addresses the validity of obligations for non-affected parties, and the query's scenario about one party rescinding due to being an adult ward does not directly challenge this principle.
- **Corrected Evaluation**: 
    - (Query entails B2) remains correct because the scenario involves independent obligations among jointly and severally liable parties.
    - Upon reconsideration, it seems there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the query's agreement or disagreement with R1. The query actually aligns with the principle that one party's grounds for rescission do not impair the validity of the obligation of other joint and several obligors, thus:
    - (Query agree R1).

The final answer is: 
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 (query entails B2).(query agree R1).
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 13 seeks to establish that a person under curatorship must obtain the consent of the curator for certain acts, and if the curator does not give consent in cases where the interest of the person under curatorship is unlikely to be prejudiced, the person may claim permission from the family court. Thus, the root node (R1) can be stated as:

- R1: A person under curatorship may perform specific acts without the curator's consent if the family court grants permission.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:

- A1: The requirement for a curator's consent for certain acts.
- A2: The provision for family court intervention when the curator does not give consent.
- A3: The condition that the act must not prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

From Abstract Factor A1:

- B1: Receiving or using property producing civil fruit requires a curator's consent.
- B2: Borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation requires a curator's consent.
- B3: Performing acts with the purpose of acquiring or losing rights regarding immovables or significant property requires a curator's consent.

From Abstract Factor A2:

- B4: The family court may grant permission for acts without the curator's consent if it does not prejudice the person under curatorship.

From Abstract Factor A3:

- B5: The act in question must not be likely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship for the family court to consider granting permission.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- Support Link: (B1 supports A1), (B2 supports A1), (B3 supports A1)
- Support Link: (B4 supports A2), (B5 supports A3)
- Support Link: (A1 supports R1), (A2 supports R1), (A3 supports R1)

Given the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure, we can analyze as follows:

### Justification

The query states that with respect to any act which requires the consent of the curator, if the curator does not give consent in cases where the interest of the person under curatorship is unlikely to be prejudiced, the person under curatorship may make a claim to the family court for a permission in lieu of the consent of the curator. This scenario directly aligns with Base-Level Factor B4 and the conditions set forth by Abstract Factors A2 and A3.

Therefore, (query entails B4).

Considering the alignment with B4 and its support link to R1 through A2, it's clear that the query agrees with the root node R1, as both concern the scenario where permission from the family court can be sought when the curator does not consent, under the condition that the act does not prejudice the person under curatorship.

Thus, (query agree R1).

After re-justification, considering the direct relationship between the query and the provisions outlined in Article 13 regarding seeking family court intervention for acts requiring a curator's consent, the conclusion remains consistent with the initial analysis.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict established by the article. In this case:

- **R1**: Possessory rights may be acquired through an agent, and the original owner can demand the return of stolen property from a third party who has possession of it.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

These are key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion:

- **A1**: The concept of possessory rights being transferable or exercisable through agents.
- **A2**: The principle of recovery of stolen property, where the original owner has rights to demand its return.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

From Abstract Factor A1 and A2, we derive more specific conditions:

- **B1** (child of A1): If an item is leased by its owner to another party, the owner retains possessory rights over the item.
- **B2** (child of A2): If an item is stolen from someone who lawfully possesses it, the original owner can seek its return through legal action.

### 4. Establish Directed Links

- **Support Link**: B1 supports A1, because leasing an item does not relinquish all possessory rights.
- **Support Link**: B2 supports A2, as the principle of recovering stolen property is directly applicable in such scenarios.
- **Support Link**: A1 supports R1, since acquiring possessory rights through agents (including leasing) validates the original owner's claim to the item.
- **Support Link**: A2 supports R1, because it further establishes the owner's right to recover stolen property.

Given these definitions and links:

### Evaluating the Query

The query states: "A has leased and delivered movable X owned by A to B. If C steals X from B, A may demand C to return X by an action for recovery of possession."

- **(query entails B1)** because it involves a scenario where the owner (A) leases the item (X) to another party (B), which aligns with the base-level factor B1 about retaining possessory rights after leasing.
- **(query entails B2)** since C stealing X from B and A seeking its return through legal action directly relates to the principle of recovering stolen property outlined in B2.

### Agreement with Root Node

Given that both B1 and B2 are entailed by the query, and considering their support for A1 and A2 respectively, which in turn support R1:

- **(query agree R1)** because the scenario described aligns with the legal conclusion that possessory rights can be exercised through agents (in this case, leasing to B) and that the original owner has a right to recover stolen property.

Upon reevaluation, the justification holds consistent. The query's scenario directly involves principles covered by both base-level factors B1 and B2, which support the abstract factors A1 and A2. These, in turn, validate the root node R1's legal conclusion about possessory rights and recovery of stolen property, leading to the agreement between the query and R1. 

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article discusses the extinction of real rights when ownership and another real right on the same thing are acquired by the same person. The root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: Acquisition of ownership and another real right by the same person leads to the extinction of the other real right.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **A1**: The principle that acquiring both ownership and another real right over the same thing results in the extinction of the other real right.
- **A2**: Exceptions to this principle, such as when the thing or the other real right is the object of a third party's right.
- **A3**: The distinction between different types of real rights, including possessory rights.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From the abstract factors, we can derive base-level factors:
- **B1** (from A1): If an individual acquires ownership and a mortgage on the same property, the mortgage should be extinguished.
- **B2** (from A2): The exception applies when a third party holds a right over the property or the real right in question, preventing extinction.
- **B3** (from A3): Possessory rights are not subject to the provisions regarding the extinction of real rights upon acquisition of ownership.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The principle of extinction supports the root conclusion.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: Exceptions negate the general rule, leading to cases where extinction does not occur.
- **(A3 denies A1)**: The special consideration for possessory rights negates the support of A1 for R1 in cases involving possessory rights.

### Analysis of Query
Given query: "In case where B holds the mortgage ranked first and C holds the mortgage ranked second with respect to a building belonging to A, even if B purchases the building from A, the mortgage ranked first shall not be extinguished."

- **(query entails B2)**: The scenario described involves a third party's right (C's mortgage), which aligns with the exception outlined in B2.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query suggests that acquiring ownership does not lead to the extinction of the other real right (the first-ranked mortgage) due to the involvement of a third party's rights, thus disagreeing with the general conclusion stated by R1.

Justification:
The query presents a scenario where B acquires ownership of a building from A but holds a first-ranked mortgage on it, and C holds a second-ranked mortgage. According to the article, if the thing or the other real right (in this case, the mortgages) is the object of a third party's right, then the principle of extinction does not apply. This aligns with base-level factor B2, which considers exceptions due to third-party rights.

Upon re-justification, considering the involvement of third-party rights (C's second-ranked mortgage), it reinforces that the query indeed entails B2 and disagrees with R1 under the specific circumstances described, as the general rule of extinction is subject to exceptions based on the presence of third-party rights. 

Therefore:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 197 and Article 200 can be summarized as follows: A possessor who is forcibly dispossessed may demand the restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage by filing an action for recovery of possession, regardless of whether the initial possession was with the intention to own. Thus, the root node (R1) could be: "A possessor can demand the return of an item based on an action for the recovery of possession after being forcibly dispossessed."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The possession was forcibly taken away.
- A2: The possessor had the intention to own the item before dispossession.
- A3: The person taking possession does so with knowledge of the unlawful nature of their actions.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
From A1, we have:
- B1: The forceful dispossession occurred without the possessor's consent.
- B2: The forceful dispossession was a direct act against the possessor.

From A2, we have:
- B3: The possession before dispossession was with the intention to own.
- B4: The possession before dispossession was without the intention to own.

From A3, we directly consider it as an abstract factor affecting the support of the root conclusion, especially in relation to successors of the person who forcibly took possession.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- A1 supports R1 because being forcibly dispossessed is a direct reason for filing an action for recovery of possession.
- A2 does not directly deny or support R1 since the intention to own is not a requirement for filing an action for recovery of possession according to Article 200.
- A3 denies the support from A1 to R1 in cases where successors without knowledge of the unlawful taking are involved, as per Article 200(2).

### Justification
Given the query: "If the possession of an item is forcibly dispossessed by the possessor, even in cases where the possession before the dispossession was performed with the intention to own, and in cases without intention to own, the possessor can demand the return of the item based on action for the recovery of possession."

- The query entails B1 because it involves forceful dispossession.
- The query also aligns with B3 and B4 since it mentions scenarios both with and without the intention to own before dispossession.

Considering these base-level factors, the query agrees with R1. This is because both the query and R1 conclude that a possessor can demand the return of an item after being forcibly dispossessed, regardless of their initial intention regarding ownership.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B3)
- (query entails B4)
- (query agree R1)

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances of the legal provisions and the structure constructed, it's clear that the query directly relates to the conditions under which a possessor can demand restitution after forceful dispossession. The intention to own or not does not affect the ability to file an action for recovery of possession according to Article 200, supporting the agreement between the query and R1.

 To address the given problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 541 seeks to establish that if one party does not perform their obligation and the other party demands performance within a reasonable period without success, the demanding party may cancel the contract unless the non-performance is minor.

- **Root Node (R1):** A party may cancel a contract if the other party fails to perform their obligations after being given a reasonable time frame to do so, provided the non-performance is not minor.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Non-performance of contractual obligations by one party.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Demand for performance by the other party within a reasonable period.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The nature of non-performance being not minor.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)

From Abstract Factors, we can derive:

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Failure to deliver goods without defects as agreed upon (supports A1).
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Specification of a reasonable time frame for performance after initial failure (supports A2).
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The defect significantly impacts the use or value of the item (supports A3).

### 4. Establish Directed Links

- **Support Link:** B1 supports A1, indicating that failure to deliver without defects validates the reason for potential contract cancellation.
- **Support Link:** B2 supports A2, as specifying a reasonable time frame is crucial for demanding performance.
- **Support Link:** B3 supports A3, showing that significant impact due to defects justifies considering the non-performance as not minor.
- **Support Link:** A1 supports R1, as non-performance is a direct reason for cancellation.
- **Support Link:** A2 supports R1, because demanding performance within a reasonable time frame is necessary before cancellation.
- **Support Link:** A3 supports R1, since only non-minor non-performances justify cancellation.

### Query Analysis

Given the query about (A) selling a used bicycle with a latent defect to (B), and (B) not being able to achieve their purpose due to the defect:

- **(Query entails B1):** The situation involves delivering a defective product, which aligns with B1.
- **(Query entails B3):** The defect impacts (B)'s ability to use the bicycle as intended, supporting B3.

### Agreement with Root Node

Considering R1 and the query's scenario:

- **(Query agrees R1):** Since the non-performance (delivering a defective product) is significant enough to prevent (B) from using the bicycle for its intended purpose, and assuming (A) was given a reasonable time to correct this or replace the bicycle without doing so, (B) may indeed cancel the contract according to Article 541.

After careful consideration, the analysis holds that the query's scenario aligns with the conditions outlined in Articles 541 and 564 for cancelling a contract due to non-performance of obligations, particularly when the defect is significant enough to negate the purpose of the sale. 

**Final Answer:**
- (Query entails B1)
- (Query entails B3)
- (Query agrees R1)

The outcome of Article 398-8 seeks to establish how a revolving mortgage is secured when succession involving either a revolving mortgagee or an obligor commences before the principal is crystallized. Thus, the root node can be stated as:

- **R1**: The principal secured by a revolving mortgage is determined at the time of the commencement of succession unless there's an agreement between the heirs and the mortgagor to succeed the revolving mortgage.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:

- **A1**: The existence of an agreement between the heirs and the mortgagor after the commencement of succession.
- **A2**: The registration of agreements within six months of the commencement of succession.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

Base-level factors specifying conditions include:

- **B1** (child of A1): An agreement between the heirs and the revolving mortgagor to succeed the revolving mortgage after the commencement of succession.
    - **(B1 supports A1)**: B1 directly supports A1 because it specifies a condition under which the principal secured by the revolving mortgage can be adjusted after the commencement of succession.
- **B2** (child of A2): The registration of agreements within six months of the commencement of succession.
    - **(B2 supports A2)**: B2 directly supports A2 as it outlines a necessary step for the agreements to be recognized.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factor

- **(A1 supports R1)**: The existence of an agreement between the heirs and the mortgagor supports the root determination that the principal secured by a revolving mortgage can be adjusted based on post-commencement agreements.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Proper registration of these agreements also supports the root, as it ensures legal recognition of the adjustments to the principal.
  
Given the query: "If an inheritance of a revolving mortgagee commences before the principal is fixed, the principal secured by a Revolvoing Mortgage shall be fixed at the time of the commencement of the inheritance, unless there is the agreement between the heirs and the revolving mortgagor to succeed the Revolving Mortgage."

### Justification

- The query entails **B1** because both consider scenarios where an agreement between the heirs and the revolving mortgagor affects the determination of the principal secured by the revolving mortgage after the commencement of succession.
- The query agrees with **R1**. Both state that the principal is fixed at the time of inheritance commencement unless there's a specific agreement to adjust this based on post-commencement agreements between heirs and the mortgagor.

### Output

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by the outcome of the article. In this case, the article concludes that a juridical act performed by an adult ward is voidable unless it involves daily necessities or day-to-day life activities.

- **Root Node (R1):** A juridical act by an adult ward is voidable except for daily necessities or acts in day-to-day life.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are the key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion of the root node. 

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The act being a juridical one performed by an adult ward.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The nature of the act (daily necessities, day-to-day life activities, etc.).

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
We derive base-level factors that specify conditions under which the abstract factors operate.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The act involves the purchase of daily necessities.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The act is a gift contract for a building, not involving daily necessities or day-to-day life activities.
- **Support Link:** B1 supports A2 because purchasing daily necessities aligns with acts in day-to-day life that are exempt from being voidable.
- **Support Link:** B2 does not directly support any abstract factor without additional context but could relate to the general principle of a juridical act by an adult ward, thus indirectly relating to A1.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factor
Each abstract factor must either support or deny the root determination.

- **Support Link:** A1 supports R1 because being a juridical act by an adult ward is the primary condition for it to be voidable.
- **Support Link:** A2 denies R1 in cases where the act involves daily necessities or day-to-day life, indicating an exception to the voidability rule.

### Analysis of Query
The query states that an adult ward cannot rescind a gift contract for a building. This implies the act is not voidable under certain conditions (in this case, receiving a gift).

- **Query Entails B2:** The query involves a scenario where an adult ward receives a gift (a building), which aligns with Base-Level Factor B2.
  
Given that the query entails B2 and considering the directed links established:
- A1 supports R1, suggesting juridical acts by adult wards are generally voidable.
- However, the specific condition of receiving a gift (B2) does not directly support or deny any abstract factor without considering its nature as an exception to daily necessities/day-to-day activities.

Since B2 relates more closely with the scenario of a juridical act that is not about daily necessities but doesn't specify it's part of day-to-day life, we need to consider if receiving a gift (a building) would align with being voidable or not based on the exceptions provided.

- **Query Disagrees R1:** Given the query's context (receiving a gift of a building), and considering that such acts might be seen as outside the realm of daily necessities but still significant in the ward's life, it could suggest an interpretation where the act is not voidable. This would mean the query disagrees with the root node's general verdict of voidability for all juridical acts by adult wards except those explicitly exempted.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, considering the specifics of the query (an adult ward receiving a gift of a building) and the structure established:
- The act of receiving a gift does not fit neatly into daily necessities or typical day-to-day life activities as exemptions.
- However, the context provided by the query (focusing on the inability to rescind the contract) suggests an interpretation where such acts are treated differently than standard voidable contracts.

Given this, the conclusion that the query disagrees with R1 seems plausible because it highlights a scenario where the general rule of voidability might not apply due to the nature of the act (receiving a gift), which could be interpreted as falling under exceptions or specific considerations not directly addressed by the root node's conditions. 

### Final Output
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query disagrees R1)**

This output reflects that the query aligns with the scenario described in Base-Level Factor B2 and presents a disagreement with the general verdict outlined in Root Node R1 regarding the voidability of juridical acts by adult wards.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the article is to establish that if an offeree accepts an offer by adding any condition or making any other modification, it shall be deemed that the offeree has refused the original offer and made a new one.
- **Root Node (R1):** "Acceptance with modifications is considered a refusal of the original offer and a new offer."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors substantiating or undermining this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The offeree's acceptance includes additional conditions not originally stated in the offer.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The offeree's acceptance involves modifications to the original terms of the offer.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down the abstract factors into more specific scenarios:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The offeree adds a condition that was not part of the original offer.
    - **Support Link:** B1 supports A1
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The offeree modifies existing terms of the offer.
    - **Support Link:** B2 supports A2

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **Support Link:** A1 supports R1, because adding conditions not originally stated in the offer validates the conclusion that the original offer is refused and a new one is made.
- **Support Link:** A2 supports R1, as modifying the terms also leads to the same conclusion.

Given this structure and the query: "If the offeree has accepted the offer by adding any condition or has accepted it by making any other modification, it shall be deemed that the offeree has refused the offer and has made a new offer," we can analyze:

- The query essentially covers scenarios where the offeree either adds conditions (similar to B1) or makes modifications (akin to B2). Therefore, **(query entails B1)** and **(query entails B2)**.
- Both B1 and B2 support their respective abstract factors (A1 and A2), which in turn support the root node R1. This means that the query aligns with the conclusion established by R1, as it presents scenarios that lead to the same legal verdict: acceptance with modifications is considered a refusal of the original offer and a new offer.
- Hence, **(query agree R1)**.

Upon careful reconsideration, this analysis holds because the query directly addresses the conditions under which an offeree's response would be deemed not just an acceptance but a new offer due to added conditions or modifications. These are exactly the scenarios covered by B1 and B2, supporting A1 and A2, which in turn validate R1. Therefore, there is no disagreement with the root conclusion provided; rather, the query provides specific instances that align with it.

**Final Output:**
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, let's break it down into steps to form the ANGELIC structure and then analyze the query in relation to this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Given the context of competing statutory liens between an electronics store (for the sale of refrigerators) and employees (for unpaid salaries), the root node can be formulated as:
- R1: The electronics store's statutory lien with respect to the refrigerators shall prevail over the employees' statutory lien.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion. Based on the provided articles, we can identify the following abstract factors:
- A1: General Statutory Liens - Expenses for common benefit have priority.
- A2: Special Statutory Liens - Have priority over general statutory liens in specific scenarios (like sale of movables).
- A3: Employer-Employee Relationship - Salaries and claims arising from this relationship can establish a lien.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are more specific conditions or scenarios that fall under the abstract factors. For each abstract factor, we can identify:
- B1 (under A1): Expenses for common benefit take precedence over other general statutory liens.
- B2 (under A2): The sale of movables establishes a special statutory lien.
- B3 (under A3): Unpaid salaries create a lien against the employer's assets.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root node or other abstract factors. Given our scenario:
- A2 supports R1 because special statutory liens (like those for the sale of refrigerators) have priority over general statutory liens (like those for unpaid salaries).
- A3 could potentially deny R1 if it were not for the prioritization stated in Article 329, but since A2 specifically addresses scenarios like the sale of movables, A3's impact is negated by A2.
- B2 supports A2, as it specifies a scenario (sale of movables) where a special statutory lien applies.

### ANGELIC Structure:
- R1: The electronics store's statutory lien prevails over the employees'.
- A1: General Statutory Liens priority
- A2: Special Statutory Liens priority
  - B2: Sale of movables establishes a special lien, supports A2
- A3: Employer-Employee Relationship liens
- Links:
  - (A2 supports R1)
  - (B2 supports A2)

### Query Analysis
The query states that the electronics store's statutory lien with respect to the refrigerators shall prevail over the employees' statutory lien. This scenario directly involves the sale of movables (refrigerators), which establishes a special statutory lien according to Article 311.

- (query entails B2) because both consider the scenario of selling movables.
- Since B2 supports A2, and A2 supports R1, we can conclude that the query agrees with R1 in the context provided by the articles.
- Therefore, (query agree R1).

After rejustification, considering the specific prioritization rules outlined in Article 329 and how special statutory liens take precedence over general ones, the conclusion remains consistent. The electronics store's lien for the sale of refrigerators is a special statutory lien that would indeed have priority over the employees' general statutory lien for unpaid salaries, according to the provided legal framework.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that with respect to gifts with burden, beyond what is provided for in this Section, the provisions regarding bilateral contracts apply mutatis mutandis. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: Provisions regarding bilateral contracts apply mutatis mutandis to gifts with burden.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
- A1: Nature of gifts with burden allowing for mutual obligations.
- A2: Provisions in the section specifically addressing gifts with burden.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion by considering whether gifts with burden inherently allow for bilateral contract provisions to apply and if the specific provisions in the section are consistent with this application.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factor A1, we can derive:
- B1: Gifts with burden involve mutual obligations that can be governed by bilateral contract provisions.
- B2: The nature of gifts with burden is inconsistent with the principles of bilateral contracts.

From Abstract Factor A2, we have:
- B3: Specific provisions in the section explicitly state the applicability of bilateral contract provisions to gifts with burden.
- B4: The section's provisions do not address the applicability of bilateral contracts to gifts with burden.

Each base-level factor has a support link to its abstract parent. For example:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 denies A1)
- (B3 supports A2)
- (B4 denies A2)

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factor
Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination:
- (A1 supports R1): The nature of gifts with burden supports the application of bilateral contract provisions.
- (A2 supports R1): Specific provisions in the section support the application of bilateral contract provisions to gifts with burden.

Given the query: "With respect to gifts, even if they are with burden, the provisions regarding bilateral contracts shall not apply mutatis mutandis," we can analyze its relationship with the constructed ANGELIC structure.

### Justification
The query directly contradicts the root node R1 by stating that provisions regarding bilateral contracts shall not apply to gifts with burden. This indicates a disagreement with the root's verdict. 

- The query entails B2 (query entails B2), as both consider scenarios where gifts with burden may not align with bilateral contract principles.
- Given this entailment and the direct contradiction of the root node's statement, we can conclude that the query disagrees with R1 (query disagree R1).

Upon rejustification, considering the explicit language of the query and its implications on the applicability of bilateral contract provisions to gifts with burden, it becomes clear that the query fundamentally challenges the premise established by R1. Thus, the conclusion that the query disagrees with R1 remains consistent upon further reflection.

**Output:**
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 514(2) is that "The obligor after the novation by substitution of obligor does not acquire a right to reimbursement from the obligor prior to the novation." Thus, our root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The debtor after a novation by substitution of debtor does not acquire the right of reimbursement against the debtor before the novation.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion in R1 include:
- **A1**: The effect of novation on obligations and rights.
- **A2**: The contractual agreement between parties in a novation by substitution of obligor.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion based on how novation affects obligations and the specifics of the contractual agreements made during such processes.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down A1 and A2 into more specific base-level factors:
- From **A1** (The effect of novation on obligations and rights):
  - **B1**: Novation extinguishes the original obligation, replacing it with a new one.
  - **B2**: The rights and liabilities of parties are altered according to the terms of the novation agreement.
- From **A2** (The contractual agreement between parties in a novation by substitution of obligor):
  - **B3**: The new obligor assumes all obligations under the contract, as agreed upon during novation.
  - **B4**: The original obligor is released from their obligations upon completion of the novation process.

Each base-level factor has a support link to its respective abstract parent:
- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A1**
- **B3 supports A2**
- **B4 supports A2**

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination. Here, both abstract factors support the root:
- **A1 supports R1**: The effect of novation on obligations and rights directly influences whether the new obligor can claim reimbursement from the original obligor.
- **A2 supports R1**: The specifics of the contractual agreement during novation by substitution of obligor also determine the rights and liabilities, including any potential for reimbursement.

### Justification
Given the query "The debtor after a novation by substitution of debtor does not acquire the right of reimbursement against the debtor before the novation," we can see that:
- **(query entails B1)**: The query aligns with the scenario where novation extinguishes the original obligation, replacing it with a new one, which includes the understanding that the new obligor does not have a claim against the previous obligor.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query directly agrees with the root node's conclusion that the debtor after a novation by substitution of debtor does not acquire the right of reimbursement against the debtor before the novation.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of how novation affects obligations and contractual agreements during such processes, it remains clear that both the base-level factor B1 and the root node R1 are directly relevant to the query's scenario. The essence of the query aligns with the principles outlined in the provided legal provisions, especially concerning the effects of novation on rights to reimbursement between original and new obligors. Thus, the initial justification stands as accurate upon further review.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this framework, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should establish a clear legal conclusion or verdict based on the articles provided. From Article 542, we can derive a root node related to the cancellation of a contract due to non-performance or defects.

- **R1:** A buyer can cancel a contract if the subject of the sale has a latent defect that prevents achieving the purpose of the contract.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These factors substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion in R1.

- **A1:** The existence of a latent defect in the subject of the sale.
- **A2:** The buyer's inability to achieve the purpose of the contract due to the defect.
- **A3:** The seller's obligation to ensure the subject of the sale is free from defects that would prevent its intended use.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
These are derived from Abstract Factors and specify conditions.

- **B1 (from A1):** The latent defect significantly impairs the functionality or value of the subject of the sale.
- **B2 (from A2):** The buyer has explicitly stated the purpose of the contract, and the defect directly hinders achieving this purpose.
- **B3 (from A3):** The seller was aware or should have been aware of the latent defect before the sale.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
Each abstract factor supports or denies the root determination or another abstract factor.

- **(A1 supports R1):** The presence of a latent defect directly supports the buyer's right to cancel the contract.
- **(A2 supports R1):** If the defect prevents achieving the contract's purpose, it supports cancellation.
- **(A3 supports R1):** The seller's obligation to provide a defect-free product supports the buyer's right to cancel if this obligation is not met.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "In cases where the subject of a sale has a latent defect, if the buyer cannot achieve the purpose of the contract due to the existence of the defect, the buyer can cancel the contract."

- **(Query entails B1 and B2):** The query specifically mentions a scenario where a latent defect prevents the buyer from achieving the contract's purpose, which aligns with the conditions described in B1 and B2.
- **(Query agrees R1):** The query's conclusion that the buyer can cancel the contract under these circumstances directly aligns with the verdict established in R1.

Upon rejustification, considering the detailed analysis above:

- The query indeed entails base-level factors **B1** and **B2**, as it describes a scenario where a latent defect impacts the functionality or value of the sale subject and hinders achieving the contract's purpose.
- The query also agrees with the root node **R1**, as both conclude that the buyer has the right to cancel the contract under such circumstances.

Therefore, the output is:
- (Query entails B1)
- (Query entails B2)
- (Query agrees R1)

57 correct 27 wrongs 84 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 169 is that the period of prescription for a right determined by a final and binding judgment or anything with the same effect is 10 years. Thus, the root node can be formulated as:
- **R1:** The period of prescription for claims determined by a final and binding judgment is 10 years.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** Claims determined by a final and binding judgment.
- **A2:** Provisions for periods of prescription shorter than 10 years.
- **A3:** Claims not yet due and payable at the time of determination.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
From Abstract Factor A1, we can derive:
- **B1:** Claims from commercial transactions determined by a final and binding judgment or civil conciliation for installment payments.
  
From Abstract Factor A2, we have:
- **B2:** Specific legal provisions that might shorten the prescription period.

And from Abstract Factor A3:
- **B3:** Claims not yet due at the time of being determined by a judgment or similar effect.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **A1 supports R1** because claims determined by a final and binding judgment indeed fall under the 10-year prescription period.
- **A2 denies R1** in cases where shorter prescription periods are legally provided, potentially altering the outcome.
- **A3 denies A1** since claims not yet due and payable do not immediately start their prescription period upon determination.

### Analysis of Query
Given the query about a delay in performance of a claim due to a commercial transaction with a civil conciliation for installment payments:
- The query entails **B1** because it involves a scenario similar to claims from commercial transactions determined by a form of judgment or agreement (civil conciliation) that specifies installment payments.
  
Considering the root node R1, which states that the period of prescription for such claims is 10 years:
- The query agrees with **R1**, as both the query and R1 conclude that the prescription period for relevant claims should be 10 years in similar scenarios involving commercial transactions and determinations by judgments or agreements like civil conciliations.

### Justification
Upon analyzing the structure and comparing it with the given query, we find:
- The query directly relates to **B1** because it deals with a delay in performance due to a commercial transaction and involves a form of determination (civil conciliation) that leads to installment payments.
- Both the query and **R1** are concerned with establishing the period of prescription for claims determined by judgments or similar effects, concluding in favor of a 10-year period.

Thus, after careful consideration:
- The output is: (query entails B1), (query agree R1).

This conclusion aligns with the ANGELIC structure's representation of legal relationships and determinations regarding periods of prescription for claims under specific conditions.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break it down into steps to construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the query against this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 545, the root node can be identified as:
- R1: The exercise of the right to cancel a contract does not preclude claims for compensation for loss or damage, and each party must restore the other to their original state.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From Article 545, we can derive:
- A1: The obligation to restore each party to their original state upon cancellation.
- A2: The requirement for interest to accrue on monies to be refunded from the time of receipt.
- A3: The necessity to return fruits that have accrued on a thing other than money from the time of its receipt.
- A4: The principle that the right to cancel does not preclude claims for compensation.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- B1 (supports A1): If a contract is cancelled, each party must return what they received.
- B2 (supports A2): Interest accrues on refunded monies from the time of their receipt.
- B3 (supports A3): Fruits or profits from non-monetary items must be returned upon cancellation.
- B4 (supports A4): Compensation claims are valid despite contract cancellation.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- Support links:
  - (B1 supports A1)
  - (B2 supports A2)
  - (B3 supports A3)
  - (B4 supports A4)
  - (A1 supports R1)
  - (A2 supports R1)
  - (A3 supports R1)
  - (A4 supports R1)
- No deny links are directly applicable from the given provisions, as all conditions support the root conclusion.

### Analyzing the Query
The query discusses a scenario where a sales contract is cancelled due to the seller's default. The buyer has paid a portion of the purchase price, and upon cancellation, the seller must return this amount but without adding interest from the time of receipt.

### Justification
- The query entails B1 because it involves returning what was received (the portion of the purchase price).
- However, the query seems to disagree with A2 (and by extension R1) regarding the accrual of interest on refunded monies. According to Article 545(2), interest must accrue from the time of receipt, but the query suggests there's no need to add interest.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

This conclusion is based on the understanding that while the query agrees with the principle of restoring parties to their original state (B1), it appears to contradict the provision regarding the accrual of interest on refunded monies, which is a part of the broader conclusion represented by R1.

 To address the given problem, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the article seeks to establish or refute. In this case, the article discusses the rights and limitations of a pledgee in collecting a pledged claim, specifically when the subject matter of the pledge is a monetary claim.

**Root Node (R1):** A pledgee may collect the entire amount of a monetary claim that is the subject matter of a pledge, notwithstanding the amount of the pledgee's own claim.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion established by the root node.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The nature of the pledged claim (whether it is monetary or not) affects the pledgee's rights.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The amount of the pledgee's own claim can limit the extent to which the pledgee may collect on a pledged monetary claim.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are more specific conditions that either substantiate or undermine the abstract factors.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** If the subject matter of the pledged claim is monies, the pledgee may collect the same to the extent of the portion that corresponds to the amount of the pledgee's own claim. (Supports A2)
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The due date of the pledged claim and the claim of the pledgee can affect how the pledgee collects on the pledge. (Supports A1)

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Knowing whether the claim is monetary or not directly influences the pledgee's ability to collect, thus supporting the root conclusion.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: The limitation based on the amount of the pledgee's own claim contradicts the absolute collection right stated in R1.

### Angelic Structure Formation
Given the criteria:
- **Existence of a Root Node (R1)**: Established as the pledgee's ability to collect on a monetary claim.
- **Single Directed Linkage**: Each factor has one link.
- **Representation of Context and Relationships**: Clearly defined nodes and links.
- **Node Naming Convention**: Followed as per instructions.
- **Link Representation Format**: Used support and deny links as instructed.

### Query Analysis
**Query:** If a monetary claim is the subject matter of a pledged claim, the pledgee may collect the entire amount of such monetary claim notwithstanding the amount of the pledgee's own claim.

The query directly contradicts the specific limitation mentioned in Article 366(2), which states that if monies are the subject matter of a pledged claim, the pledgee may collect the same to the extent of the portion that corresponds to the amount of the pledgee's own claim. This means the query does not align with **Base-Level Factor (B1)**, as B1 specifies collection is limited to the extent corresponding to the pledgee's own claim.

However, the query seems to align more closely with a scenario where the pledgee has unconditional rights to collect on a monetary claim, which would be in disagreement with the detailed stipulations provided by the article, particularly Article 366(2).

### Justification
- **(Query disagrees R1)**: The query suggests an unconditional right to collect the entire amount of a monetary claim, which contradicts the conditional collection rights outlined in the article.
- **(Query does not entail B1)**: Because the query ignores the limitation on collection based on the pledgee's own claim amount.

Given this analysis, it appears there was an oversight in directly linking the query to base-level factors without adequately considering the specifics of Article 366. The critical aspect is how the query interacts with the root node (R1) and its alignment or disagreement with the legal conclusion established by the article. 

Upon reevaluation:
- The query indeed presents a scenario that **disagrees** with the nuanced collection rights provided in the article, specifically with how Article 366(2) limits collection to the portion corresponding to the pledgee's own claim.
- Therefore, the justification that **(query disagrees R1)** stands as the most accurate reflection of the query's relationship to the root node's legal conclusion.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a manifestation of intention against another party is not valid if that other party had no mental capacity or was a minor or an adult ward at the time of receiving it, unless certain conditions are met.

- **Root Node (R1):** A manifestation of intention against a person without mental capacity or who is a minor or an adult ward does not take effect until specific conditions are met.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- The recipient's lack of mental capacity.
- The recipient being a minor.
- The recipient being an adult ward.
- The condition that the manifestation takes effect after the legal representative learns of it or after the recipient gains capacity.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Lack of mental capacity at the time of receiving the manifestation.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Being a minor at the time of receiving the manifestation.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Being an adult ward at the time of receiving the manifestation.
- **Abstract Factor (A4):** Conditions under which the manifestation takes effect despite initial incapacity.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Breaking down Abstract Factors into more specific conditions:
- From A1, we have **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The recipient had no mental capacity due to a medical condition.
- From A2, **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The recipient was under the age of majority.
- From A3, **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The recipient was legally declared an adult ward.
- From A4, we have **Base-Level Factor (B4):** The legal representative of the recipient learned of the manifestation.
  - And **Base-Level Factor (B5):** The recipient's mental capacity was restored after receiving the manifestation.

Each Base-Level Factor supports its respective Abstract Factor:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (B3 supports A3)
- (B4 supports A4)
- (B5 supports A4)

### 4. Establish Directed Links of Abstract Factors
Abstract factors either support or deny the root determination:
- **Support Link:** (A1 supports R1), because lack of mental capacity is a reason for the manifestation not to take effect initially.
- **Support Link:** (A2 supports R1), as being a minor also invalidates the immediate effect of the manifestation.
- **Support Link:** (A3 supports R1), since being an adult ward similarly affects the validity of the manifestation at the time received.
- **Support Link:** (A4 supports R1), because it specifies conditions under which the manifestation does take effect, aligning with the root's conditionality.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "In the case where (A) is an adult ward at the time when (A) receives a manifestation of intention of cancellation of a contract, the cancellation of the contract shall not take effect until (A)'s guardian of adult, (C), has acquired the knowledge of (B)'s manifestation of intention of cancellation of the contract."

- **Entailment:** The query entails Base-Level Factor B3, because both consider a scenario where the recipient is an adult ward.
  - (query entails B3)
  
- **Agreement with Root:** The query agrees with Root Node R1. Both state that under certain conditions (like being an adult ward), a manifestation of intention does not immediately take effect but requires additional conditions to be met, such as the guardian's knowledge.
  - (query agree R1)

Upon careful reconsideration, the analysis remains consistent: the query specifically addresses a situation covered by the base-level factor concerning adult wards and aligns with the root node's overall legal conclusion regarding the conditions under which a manifestation of intention becomes effective. 

Thus, the output is:
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process into steps based on the provided legal provisions and the ANGELIC structure formation criteria.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 203, the root node can be identified as:
- R1: Possessory rights are extinguished under certain conditions (renunciation of intention to possess or loss of possession, with an exception for filing an action for recovery of possession).

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that either support or undermine the root conclusion. For Article 203 and the given query:
- A1: Renunciation of the intention to possess.
- A2: Loss of possession.
- A3: Filing an action for recovery of possession as an exception to extinction.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are more specific conditions derived from abstract factors. For each abstract factor:
- B1 (from A1): The possessor explicitly states they no longer wish to possess the item.
- B2 (from A2): Physical control over the possessed thing is lost due to theft or other means.
- B3 (from A3): An action for recovery of possession is filed before the loss of possession becomes final.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root node or other abstract factors. Given the context:
- A1 supports R1 (Renunciation leads to extinction of possessory rights).
- A2 supports R1 (Loss of possession leads to extinction, unless an exception applies).
- A3 denies R1 (Filing for recovery of possession prevents extinction).

### Application to Query
The query states: "B exercises a right of retention against movable X owned by A. If C steals X from B, B may not demand C to return X by an action for recovery of possession."

Given this scenario:
- The query entails B2 (loss of possession due to theft).
- Since B was exercising a right of retention and not ownership, and the item was stolen, the scenario involves loss of physical control, aligning with B2.

### Agreement with Root Node
Considering R1 (possessory rights are extinguished under certain conditions), the query seems to disagree because it suggests a situation where possessory rights might be considered extinct due to theft (loss of possession) without the possibility of recovery through an action for possession. However, this interpretation may hinge on the specific legal context and definitions of "right of retention" versus "possession."

Upon reevaluation:
- The query's scenario involves a right of retention, which is distinct from possessory rights as described in Article 203.
- The critical point is whether B's loss of X due to theft (C's action) directly aligns with the conditions under which possessory rights are extinguished according to Article 203.

Reconsidering the directed links and base-level factors:
- If B's situation aligns closely with a scenario where possession is lost, but through no fault or renunciation by B (such as theft), the filing of an action for recovery might still be relevant.
- The query suggests B may not demand return via an action for recovery of possession, which could imply disagreement with R1 under specific circumstances (theft leading to loss of possession without clear recourse).

However, this interpretation requires careful consideration of legal nuances and might depend on the jurisdiction's laws regarding rights of retention versus possessory rights.

### Conclusion
Given the steps and considerations:
- The query entails B2.
- Upon initial review, it seems the query could disagree with R1 due to the specific scenario involving theft and a right of retention. However, a detailed legal analysis considering the jurisdiction's stance on such matters is necessary for a definitive conclusion.

Output format based on the initial steps:
- (query entails B2).
- The agreement or disagreement with R1 requires further nuanced legal interpretation but could be framed as:
  - (query disagree R1) if focusing strictly on the loss of possession without considering the specific right of retention and its implications.
  - This conclusion may need adjustment based on a deeper legal analysis of rights of retention versus possessory rights in the context provided.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome or legal conclusion we're focusing on relates to how various scenarios (like novation, set-off, merger) affect joint and several obligations among obligors and an obligee. However, given the specific query about the commencement of a new period of extinctive prescription after a judgment has become final and binding, our root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** A new period of extinctive prescription commences to run at the time when a judgment concerning demand for performance of an obligation becomes final and binding.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The effect of judgments on the commencement of extinctive prescription periods.
- **A2:** The implications of joint and several obligations on the rights and liabilities of obligors and obligees, especially in scenarios like novation, set-off, and merger.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)
Breaking down **A1** and **A2** into more specific conditions:
- From **A1:**
  - **B1:** A final judgment directly impacts the extinctive prescription period.
  - **B2:** The absence of a manifest intention by the obligee or an obligor to alter the effect of a judgment on the extinctive prescription period means the standard rules apply.
- From **A2:**
  - **B3:** Joint and several obligations are affected differently in scenarios of novation, set-off, and merger.
  - **B4:** The rights and liabilities among joint obligors can be altered based on actions taken by one obligor or the obligee.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny) of Abstract Factors
- **(A1 supports R1):** The effect of judgments on extinctive prescription periods directly supports the conclusion that a new period commences after a judgment becomes final.
- **(A2 denies A1):** The complexities and variations in joint and several obligations can negate the straightforward application of judgment effects on extinctive prescription, suggesting that not all scenarios lead to a simple commencement of a new prescription period.

### Justification
Given the query about the commencement of a new period of extinctive prescription after a judgment has become final and binding, without specific intentions manifested by the obligee or an obligor:
- **(query entails B1):** The scenario described directly aligns with the condition that a final judgment impacts the extinctive prescription period.
- **(query agrees R1):** The query's scenario supports the root conclusion that a new period of extinctive prescription commences after a judgment becomes final and binding, assuming standard rules apply without any manifested intentions to alter this effect.

Upon re-justification, considering the specifics of joint and several obligations and their potential impacts on legal outcomes like extinctive prescription periods:
- The query still aligns closely with **B1** because it involves a straightforward scenario where a judgment's finality is the trigger for a new prescription period.
- The agreement with **R1** holds under the assumption that no complicating factors (like novation, set-off, or merger) are introduced to alter the standard application of extinctive prescription rules following a final judgment. 

Thus, without additional complexities or intentions expressed by the parties involved, the query aligns with the base-level factor considering the effect of judgments on extinctive prescription and agrees with the root conclusion regarding the commencement of a new prescription period after a judgment becomes final and binding.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should determine the outcome or legal conclusion established by the article. Given Article 613, the focus is on the rights and obligations between lessors, lessees, and sublessees in lease agreements. A possible root node could be:
- **R1**: The lessor has the right to demand the return of the leased thing from the sublessee upon the expiration of the lease term with the lessee.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From Article 613:
- **A1**: The lawful subleasing of a leased thing by the lessee to a sublessee.
- **A2**: The lessor's rights against the lessee are not precluded by the sublease agreement.
- **A3**: The cancellation of the lease between the lessor and lessee due to non-performance by the lessee affects the sublessee.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors
Breaking down abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- From **A1**:
  - **B1**: The lessee obtained consent from the lessor to sublease the movable.
  - **B2**: The sublease agreement is lawful and within the scope of the original lease.
- From **A2**:
  - **B3**: The lessor's rights to demand rent or return of the property are maintained despite the sublease.
- From **A3**:
  - **B4**: Non-performance by the lessee leads to cancellation, which affects the sublessee's rights.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- **Support Link**: (B1 supports A1), indicating that obtaining consent is a condition for lawful subleasing.
- **Deny/Attack Link**: (A3 denies R1) in scenarios where non-performance leads to cancellation, potentially altering the lessor's rights against the sublessee.

### Query Evaluation
Given the query: "In cases where the lessee of a movable has obtained consent from the lessor who is the owner to sublease the movable to a sub-lessee, when the term of the lease between the lessee and the lessor finishes, and the lease is not renewed, the lessor can demand the sub-lessee to return the subject based on ownership."

- The query entails **B1** because it involves a scenario where consent was obtained for subleasing.
- Considering the root node **R1**, the query essentially agrees with **R1** in scenarios where the lease term expires and is not renewed, as it posits that the lessor can demand the return of the movable from the sublessee.

### Justification
The query directly relates to the conditions outlined in **B1** and supports the conclusion in **R1**, which focuses on the lessor's right to demand the return of the leased thing upon expiration of the lease term. The scenario presented aligns with the legal principles allowing a lessor to reclaim their property from a sublessee after the original lease has ended, provided there was lawful consent for the sublease.

### Re-Justification
Upon re-evaluation, considering the specific conditions and the directed links between abstract and base-level factors:
- The presence of **B1** (consent obtained) supports the scenario where the lessor can demand return.
- There's no direct denial from any abstract factor to **R1** in this specific query context.

Thus, the conclusions are reaffirmed: 
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

This structured approach clarifies how the query aligns with the legal framework established by Article 613, supporting the lessor's right to reclaim their property under specified conditions.

62 correct 29 wrongs 91 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by identifying the primary legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Based on Article 397 and Article 162, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: A mortgage can be extinguished through acquisitive prescription under certain conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that either support or undermine the root conclusion. From the articles provided:
- A1: Possession of mortgaged immovables in complete conformity with the requirements for acquisitive prescription.
- A2: The duration and nature of possession (peaceful, open, with intention to own) as per Article 162.

### 3. Create Base-Level Factors (B)
Base-level factors are more specific scenarios or conditions derived from abstract factors:
- B1 (child of A1): Possession by a person who is neither an obligor nor a mortgagor for the required period.
- B2 (child of A2): Possession for 20 years peacefully and openly with the intention to own, as per Article 162(1).
- B3 (child of A2): Possession for 10 years in good faith and without negligence at the start, as per Article 162(2).

### 4. Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how abstract factors support or deny the root conclusion:
- (A1 supports R1): Because if a person possesses the mortgaged immovables according to prescription requirements, it leads to the extinction of the mortgage.
- (A2 supports R1): Since the conditions outlined in Article 162, when met, can lead to the acquisition of ownership and potentially affect the mortgage status.

Given these steps, we analyze the query: "If twenty years has elapsed from the time when it becomes possible to execute the mortgage, a mortgagor may assert the extinction of the mortgage by prescription."

### Justification
- The query entails B2 because both consider a scenario where a significant period (20 years) of possession is crucial for determining the acquisition of ownership or the extinction of a mortgage.
- Considering R1 and the information provided in Article 162, particularly the part about possession for 20 years leading to ownership acquisition, it suggests that such conditions could indeed support the extinction of a mortgage through prescription. Therefore, (query agree R1).

After rejustification, considering the specifics of the query and how they align with the base-level factors and the root conclusion:
- The focus on a 20-year period directly correlates with B2.
- The scenario presented aligns with the conditions under which a mortgage could be considered extinguished by prescription, as per R1.

Thus, the final analysis confirms that:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

63 correct 29 wrongs 92 out of 100 tested
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process into steps as outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node (R) is determined by answering what legal conclusion or verdict the articles seek to establish. Based on Article 634 and the query provided, the root node can be identified as follows:
- R1: The contractor may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the contract for work terminates during performance due to reasons not attributable to the contractor.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion are:
- A1: Termination of the contract due to grounds not attributable to the contractor.
- A2: The contractor's right to remuneration for completed work.
- A3: Conditions under which a party can refuse counter-performance.

### Step 3: Create Base-Level Factors (B) from Abstract Factors (A)

Breaking down abstract factors into base-level factors:
- B1 (child of A1): Termination due to unforeseen circumstances not caused by the contractor.
- B2 (child of A2): The contractor has completed a portion of the work that benefits the party ordering the work.
- B3 (child of A3): Refusal of counter-performance when obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links

Directed links between abstract factors and the root node:
- (A1 supports R1) because termination due to non-attributable reasons allows for remuneration.
- (A2 supports R1) since it establishes the right to payment for completed work.
- (A3 denies A1) in scenarios where refusal of counter-performance is considered, implying a possible negation of support for R1 under specific conditions.

### Justification

Given the query "If the contract for work terminates during performance due to reasons not attributable to the contractor, he/she may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed," we can see that:
- (query entails B1) because both consider scenarios where termination is due to non-attributable reasons.
- (query agree R1) since both conclude that the contractor may demand proportional remuneration under such conditions.

Upon re-justification, considering the provided articles and the constructed angelic structure, it's clear that the query directly aligns with the base-level factor B1 and supports the root node R1 without any direct denial from other abstract factors in this specific context. Therefore, the conclusion remains consistent.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)
