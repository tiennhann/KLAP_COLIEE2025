article: (Rights of Common with Nature of Co-Ownership)
Article 263 Rights of common that have the nature of co-ownership are governed by local customs and are otherwise subject to the application of the provisions of this Section.
(Management of Property in Co-Ownership)
Article 252(1) Matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership (including the appointment and dismissal of a manager of the property in co-ownership prescribed in paragraph (1) of the following Article, and excluding those that make any changes prescribed in paragraph (1) of the preceding Article to the property in co-ownership; the same applies in the following paragraph) are decided by a majority according to the value of the ownership shares of the co-owners. The same applies when there are co-owners who use the property in co-ownership.
(2) In any of the following cases, the court may, upon the request of a co-owner other than another co-owner listed in the respective items, render a judicial decision to the effect that matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership may be decided by a majority according to the value of the ownership shares of the co-owners other than the other co-owner in question :
(i) when a co-owner is unable to ascertain the identity of another co-owner or his/her whereabouts;
(ii) when a co-owner has given notice to another co-owner requesting him/her to clarify whether he/she is in favor of or against the idea of deciding on matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership within a reasonable period of time, and the other co-owner in question does not clarify whether he/she is in favor of or against within that period of time.
(3) If the decision under the preceding two paragraphs should have a special effect on any co-owner who uses the property in co-ownership based on a decision among co-owners, his/her consent must be obtained.
(4) Pursuant to the provisions of the preceding three paragraphs, co-owners may establish on the co-owned property the leases or other rights to use or earn profit listed in the following items (hereinafter referred to as "right of lease, etc." in this paragraph) that do not exceed the period of time specified in the relevant item:
(i) right of lease, etc. of forest for the purpose of planting or felling trees: 10 years;
(ii) right of lease, etc. for land other than the leases set forth in the preceding item: 5 years;
(iii) right of lease, etc. of a building: 3 years;
(iv) right of lease, etc. of movables: 6 months.
(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, each co-owner may perform acts of preservation.
query: Unless custom dictates otherwise, the exercise of the right to demand the elimination of obstructions against a person who obstructs the exercise of the right of common shall be made by all the members of the organization of holders of the right of common.

Number of factors : 13

Verdict: None (as the provided text consists of articles and provisions, rather than a specific case or verdict)
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 13 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

1. (1, 3 | Y)
Justification: The defendant is a co-owner of a property with rights of common that have the nature of co-ownership, governed by local customs (Factor 1). Since matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership are decided by a majority according to the value of the ownership shares of the co-owners (Factor 3), and the defendant is part of this decision-making process, they are legally obligated to follow the majority's decision.

2. (2, 5 | N)
Justification: The provisions of this Section apply to rights of common that have the nature of co-ownership, except where local customs govern (Factor 2). However, changes to the property in co-ownership that require a different decision-making process are excluded from the majority decision rule (Factor 5). Since the defendant is not part of the decision-making process for these excluded changes, they are not legally obligated.

3. (4, 11 | Y)
Justification: The appointment and dismissal of a manager of the property in co-ownership are subject to the decision-making process for matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership (Factor 4). Additionally, co-owners may establish leases or other rights to use or earn profit on the co-owned property, subject to certain time limits (Factor 11). As the defendant is part of this decision-making process and has agreed to establish a lease, they are legally obligated to honor the terms of the lease.

4. (6, 10 | Y)
Justification: Co-owners who use the property in co-ownership are subject to the same decision-making process as other co-owners (Factor 6). Furthermore, the consent of a co-owner who uses the property in co-ownership must be obtained if a decision regarding management would have a special effect on them (Factor 10). Since the defendant is a co-owner who uses the property and has given their consent to a decision that affects them, they are legally obligated to abide by that decision.

5. (7, 12 | Y)
Justification: The court may render a judicial decision to allow matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership to be decided by a majority according to the value of the ownership shares of the co-owners, excluding a specific co-owner, in certain circumstances (Factor 7). Additionally, the time limits for establishing leases or other rights to use or earn profit on the co-owned property are specified (Factor 12). If the defendant is part of the majority that has made a decision regarding a lease within these time limits, they are legally obligated to honor the terms of the lease.

6. (8, 13 | N)
Justification: A co-owner may request the court to render a judicial decision under paragraph 2 if another co-owner's identity or whereabouts are unknown (Factor 8). However, each co-owner may perform acts of preservation, notwithstanding other provisions (Factor 13). Since the defendant is performing an act of preservation and not participating in the decision-making process regarding the unknown co-owner, they are not legally obligated.

7. (3, 9 | Y)
Justification: Matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership are decided by a majority according to the value of the ownership shares of the co-owners (Factor 3). A co-owner may request the court to render a judicial decision under paragraph 2 if another co-owner fails to respond to a request for clarification on their position within a reasonable period (Factor 9). If the defendant is part of the majority that has made a decision regarding management and has requested the court's intervention due to another co-owner's lack of response, they are legally obligated to follow the court's decision.

8. (1, 6 | Y)
Justification: The defendant is a co-owner of a property with rights of common that have the nature of co-ownership, governed by local customs (Factor 1). As a co-owner who uses the property in co-ownership, they are subject to the same decision-making process as other co-owners (Factor 6). Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated to participate in and follow the decisions made by the co-owners.

9. (5, 11 | N)
Justification: Changes to the property in co-ownership that require a different decision-making process are excluded from the majority decision rule (Factor 5). Although co-owners may establish leases or other rights to use or earn profit on the co-owned property, subject to certain time limits (Factor 11), the defendant is not part of the decision-making process for these excluded changes and has not agreed to establish a lease. Hence, they are not legally obligated.

10. (2, 8 | N)
Justification: The provisions of this Section apply to rights of common that have the nature of co-ownership, except where local customs govern (Factor 2). A co-owner may request the court to render a judicial decision under paragraph 2 if another co-owner's identity or whereabouts are unknown (Factor 8). Since the defendant is not part of the decision-making process regarding the unknown co-owner and the provisions do not directly apply, they are not legally obligated.

11. (4, 7 | Y)
Justification: The appointment and dismissal of a manager of the property in co-ownership are subject to the decision-making process for matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership (Factor 4). The court may render a judicial decision to allow matters regarding the management of property in co-ownership to be decided by a majority according to the value of the ownership shares of the co-owners, excluding a specific co-owner, in certain circumstances (Factor 7). As the defendant is part of this decision-making process and has agreed to the court's intervention, they are legally obligated to follow the court's decision.

12. (9, 13 | N)
Justification: A co-owner may request the court to render a judicial decision under paragraph 2 if another co-owner fails to respond to a request for clarification on their position within a reasonable period (Factor 9). However, each co-owner may perform acts of preservation, notwithstanding other provisions (Factor 13). Since the defendant is performing an act of preservation and not participating in the decision-making process regarding the unresponsive co-owner, they are not legally obligated.

13. (10, 12 | Y)
Justification: The consent of a co-owner who uses the property in co-ownership must be obtained if a decision regarding management would have a special effect on them (Factor 10). Additionally, the time limits for establishing leases or other rights to use or earn profit on the co-owned property are specified (Factor 12). If the defendant has given their consent to a decision that affects them and has agreed to establish a lease within these time limits, they are legally obligated to honor the terms of the lease.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 593, I have broken down the text into phrases representing key factors used to determine the effectiveness of a loan for use. Here are the factors:

1. One of the parties promises to deliver a certain thing.
2. The other party promises to return the thing.
3. The contract is terminated after the other party has used the borrowed thing.
4. The other party uses the borrowed thing gratuitously (without paying).
5. The other party makes profit from using the borrowed thing.

<Number of factors : 5>

Verdict: A loan for use becomes effective if the above conditions are met.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 593, I have generated five unique legal case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only one party promises to deliver a certain thing, but there is no promise to return, no use, and no profit made from the borrowed thing. Since the key elements of a loan for use contract (promise to return, use, and termination) are missing, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Here, one party promises to return the thing, and the contract is terminated after the other party has used the borrowed thing. However, there is no promise to deliver a certain thing initially, and no gratuitous use or profit made from the borrowed thing. Without these essential factors, the defendant cannot be considered legally obligated.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: In this case, one party promises to deliver a certain thing, and the other party uses the borrowed thing gratuitously (without paying). However, there is no promise to return the thing, and the contract has not been terminated. The lack of these critical factors means the defendant is not legally obligated.

(2, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, one party promises to return the thing, the other party uses the borrowed thing gratuitously (without paying), and makes a profit from using it. Although there is no initial promise to deliver a certain thing, the presence of these three factors suggests that a loan for use contract has been implicitly formed. The defendant's actions (using the thing gratuitously and making a profit) demonstrate an acceptance of the terms, making them legally obligated.

(1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Here, one party promises to deliver a certain thing, the other party promises to return the thing, and the contract is terminated after the other party has used the borrowed thing. Although there is no mention of gratuitous use or profit made from the borrowed thing, the presence of these three factors indicates that a loan for use contract has been formed. The defendant's promise to return the thing and the termination of the contract imply an acceptance of the terms, making them legally obligated.

Each case yields a clear verdict based on the specific combination of factors present.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 **Task 1:**
The query states that "No contract of loan for use shall be effective unless it is made in writing." Based on Article 593, there is no mention of a written requirement for the contract to be effective. The article outlines specific conditions related to the delivery, return, and use of the borrowed thing but does not specify that these agreements must be in writing to be valid. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 593, the query is **False**.

**Task 2:**
Assessing whether the query expresses each factor:

1. One of the parties promises to deliver a certain thing.
   - The query does not express this factor as it discusses the form (written) of the contract rather than the actions or promises of delivery.

2. The other party promises to return the thing.
   - Similarly, the query does not address the promise of return, focusing instead on the contractual form.

3. The contract is terminated after the other party has used the borrowed thing.
   - This factor is also not addressed by the query, which focuses on the prerequisites for a contract's effectiveness rather than its termination conditions.

4. The other party uses the borrowed thing gratuitously (without paying).
   - The query does not mention usage or payment terms, thus it does not express this factor.

5. The other party makes profit from using the borrowed thing.
   - Like the previous factors, the query's focus on written contracts means it does not consider profitability from use.

Given these assessments, none of the factors are directly addressed by the query in a manner that aligns with their specific conditions. Therefore:
- (query entails 1) is False
- (query entails 2) is False
- (query entails 3) is False
- (query entails 4) is False
- (query entails 5) is False

These justifications align with the initial determination that the query's requirement for a written contract does not match the conditions outlined in Article 593.

**Task 3:**
The query "No contract of loan for use shall be effective unless it is made in writing" does imply an obligation on the parties to ensure their contracts are in writing if they wish for those contracts to be considered effective. However, this does not directly obligate a defendant in a legal sense without further context (such as a specific case where a contract's validity is being disputed). Since the query itself sets out a general condition rather than addressing a specific obligation or action of a defendant, it does not inherently determine the defendant's obligations in a manner that can be clearly represented as pledged(1) or pledged(0) without additional context. However, following the required format and considering the nature of the task:
- Since the query imposes a general condition on contracts rather than specifying an obligation directly on a defendant in a legal dispute, the most fitting response based on the provided instructions would be **pledged(0)**, indicating that the query does not specifically determine the defendant's obligations.

Justification: Although the defendant possesses the thing in good faith and openly, there is no indication of peaceful possession or intention to own, which are necessary factors to determine obligation.

(3, 5 | Y)
Justification: The defendant's peaceful possession and evidence of possession at two different points in time suggest a continuous and lawful possession, implying an obligation to respect the rights associated with the possession.

(6 | Y)
Justification: As the possessor is presumed to lawfully have the rights that a possessor exercises with respect to the thing under possession, the defendant is obligated to respect and exercise these rights responsibly.

(7, 9 | N)
Justification: Although the defendant commences the possession of movables peacefully and openly by a transactional act and without negligence, there is no indication of good faith, which is a necessary factor to determine obligation.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down each task in relation to the provided articles and query.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

Given the query: "A allowed B to retain movable X. B donated X to E and E was delivered actually believing that it belongs to B without negligence. In cases X is a jewel, E may acquire ownership of X immediately."

From Article 192, we see that a person who commences possession of movables peacefully and openly by a transactional act acquires the rights exercised with respect to the movables immediately if they possess it in good faith and without negligence. The query scenario involves B donating X (a jewel) to E, with E believing in good faith that X belongs to B and receiving it without negligence. This aligns with Article 192's conditions for immediate acquisition of rights.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the articles provided, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

Let's examine each factor in relation to the query:

1. A possessor is presumed to possess a thing with the intention to own.
   - (query entails 1) The query implies E intends to own X after receiving it from B.

2. The possession must be in good faith.
   - (query entails 2) E believes in good faith that X belongs to B, thus possessing it in good faith.

3. The possession must be peaceful.
   - (query entails 3) Although not explicitly stated, the context implies a peaceful transaction.

4. The possession must be open.
   - (query entails 4) The donation and delivery of X from B to E is an open act, given the nature of the transaction described.

5. If there is evidence of possession at two different points in time, it is presumed that possession continued during that interval.
   - This factor does not directly apply to the immediate acquisition scenario described but could be relevant in a broader context of proving continuous possession.

6. The possessor is presumed to lawfully have the rights that a possessor exercises with respect to the thing under possession.
   - (query entails 6) B, as the initial possessor, is presumed to have lawful rights over X, which are then transferred to E.

7. A person commences the possession of movables peacefully and openly by a transactional act.
   - (query entails 7) The donation from B to E is a transactional act that commences E's possession of X.

8. The possession of movables must be in good faith.
   - (query entails 8) Already addressed, as E possesses X in good faith.

9. The possession of movables must be without negligence.
   - (query entails 9) The query specifies that E receives X "without negligence."

10. The acquisition of rights to movables is immediate if the conditions are met.
    - (query entails 10) The query concludes with E possibly acquiring ownership immediately, aligning with Article 192.

These justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the context and outcome of Tasks 1 and 2, there's no direct mention or implication that a defendant is obligated to any specific action as a result of the scenario described in the query. The focus is on the conditions under which E may acquire ownership of X immediately.

Therefore, **pledged(0)**, indicating the query does not determine a defendant obligated.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. If a possessor returns a thing in the possession thereof, the possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for the costs the possessor has paid for its preservation and other necessary expenses.
2. The possessor has acquired fruits, ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor.
3. The possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for either the costs the possessor has paid or the amount of the increased value, whichever the person recovering the thing chooses, but only if there is a current increase in value.
4. With regard to a possessor in bad faith, the court may, at the request of the person recovering the thing, grant a reasonable period of time for the same.
5. A third party acquirer of a mortgaged immovables has incurred necessary or beneficial expenses with respect to the mortgaged immovables.
6. The third party may obtain reimbursement of the same out of the proceeds of the mortgaged immovables prior to other obligees, in accordance with the distinctions in Article 196.

Number of factors : 6

Verdict: The person recovering the thing is required to reimburse the possessor for certain expenses, and a third party acquirer may obtain reimbursement out of the proceeds of the mortgaged immovables.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 196 and Article 391, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors has occurred and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | Y)
In this case, factor 1 occurs: "If a possessor returns a thing in the possession thereof, the possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for the costs the possessor has paid for its preservation and other necessary expenses." Since the possessor has returned the thing and incurred costs for its preservation, the defendant (the person recovering the thing) is legally obligated to reimburse these expenses.

2. (2 | N)
Here, only factor 2 is present: "The possessor has acquired fruits, ordinary and necessary expenses are borne by the possessor." Since the possessor bears the ordinary and necessary expenses themselves when they acquire fruits, there's no obligation on the defendant in this scenario to reimburse any expenses.

3. (3 | Y)
In this case, factor 3 occurs: "The possessor may have the person recovering the thing reimburse the possessor for either the costs the possessor has paid or the amount of the increased value, whichever the person recovering the thing chooses, but only if there is a current increase in value." Given that there's an increase in value and the possessor has incurred expenses to improve the thing, the defendant is obligated to reimburse either the costs paid or the increased value, as chosen by them.

4. (4 | Y)
Factor 4 is considered: "With regard to a possessor in bad faith, the court may, at the request of the person recovering the thing, grant a reasonable period of time for the same." This scenario involves a possessor in bad faith, and the court's discretion to grant additional time implies that the defendant could still be obligated to reimburse expenses or face legal consequences after this period, depending on the court's decision.

5. (1, 5 | Y)
Factors 1 and 5 are present: The possessor returns a thing and incurs costs for its preservation (factor 1), and a third party acquirer of mortgaged immovables has incurred necessary or beneficial expenses (factor 5). Given that both the original possessor and a third-party acquirer have incurred legitimate expenses, the defendant would be obligated to reimburse these expenses, with the specifics potentially determined by the court, especially considering the priority of reimbursement out of the proceeds of the mortgaged immovables.

6. (2, 3, 6 | Y)
This scenario involves factors 2, 3, and 6: The possessor has acquired fruits (factor 2), the possessor may seek reimbursement for improvements or increased value (factor 3), and a third party may obtain reimbursement out of the proceeds of mortgaged immovables (factor 6). Although the possessor bears ordinary expenses when acquiring fruits, the presence of factor 3 indicates potential for reimbursement due to improvements or increased value. Moreover, factor 6 introduces a third-party acquirer's right to reimbursement from the mortgaged immovables' proceeds. The combination suggests that while the defendant might not be obligated for the possessor's ordinary expenses related to acquiring fruits, they could still face obligations regarding reimbursements for improvements or increased value and potentially towards the third-party acquirer, thus justifying a 'Y' determination based on the complexities of shared responsibilities and potential court-ordered reimbursements.

Number of factors : 5

Verdict: None (as there are no verdict sentences in the provided article, only factors that determine the outcome of cases applying the article)
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate five legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, only factor 1 occurs, where one of the parties exercises the right to cancel, and each party assumes an obligation to restore the other party to that other party's original state. Since the defendant is a party to the agreement, they are legally obligated to restore the other party to their original state.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors 2 and 3 occur, where the restoration of the other party to their original state may not prejudice the rights of a third party, and interest must accrue from the time of the receipt of monies to be refunded. The defendant is obligated to refund the monies with accrued interest while ensuring that the rights of a third party are not prejudiced.

(4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, only factor 4 occurs, where a thing other than money is to be returned, and fruits that have accrued on or after the time of the receipt of the thing must also be returned. The defendant is legally obligated to return the thing along with its accrued fruits.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors 1 and 5 occur, where one of the parties exercises the right to cancel, and each party assumes an obligation to restore the other party to that other party's original state, and the exercise of the right to cancel does not preclude claims for compensation for loss or damage. The defendant is obligated to restore the other party to their original state and may also be liable for compensation for any loss or damage.

(2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors 2, 3, and 4 occur, where the restoration of the other party to their original state may not prejudice the rights of a third party, interest must accrue from the time of the receipt of monies to be refunded, and fruits that have accrued on or after the time of the receipt of a thing must also be returned. The defendant is obligated to refund monies with accrued interest, return things along with their accrued fruits, and ensure that the rights of a third party are not prejudiced.

Note: In all cases, the defendant is legally obligated (Y) because each scenario involves factors that imply a responsibility or duty on the part of the defendant.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that in cases where a contract for sale of movables was concluded and a portion of the purchase money was paid, but then the contract was cancelled due to default, upon refunding the portion of the purchase money received, the seller does not have to pay interest from the time of the receipt of that money. However, according to Article 545(2), "In the case referred to in the main clause of the preceding paragraph, if any monies are to be refunded, interest must accrue from the time of the receipt of those monies." This directly contradicts the query's assertion. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 545, the query is False.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **If one of the parties exercises the right to cancel, each party assumes an obligation to restore the other party to that other party's original state.**
   - The query entails this factor because it discusses a situation where a contract is cancelled, implying the restoration of parties to their original state. (query entails 1)

2. **The restoration of the other party to their original state may not prejudice the rights of a third party.**
   - The query does not directly address the issue of third-party rights in its scenario. Therefore, it does not explicitly entail this factor based on the information given. 

3. **In cases where monies are to be refunded, interest must accrue from the time of the receipt of those monies.**
   - The query contradicts this factor by stating that the seller does not have to pay interest upon refunding the purchase money, which directly opposes what Article 545(2) states. Therefore, it does not entail this factor in a manner consistent with the article.

4. **If a thing other than money is to be returned, fruits that have accrued on or after the time of the receipt of the thing must also be returned.**
   - The query focuses on the refund of monies and does not address the return of things other than money or their fruits. Therefore, it does not entail this factor.

5. **The exercise of the right to cancel does not preclude claims for compensation for loss or damage.**
   - The query does not mention anything about claims for compensation for loss or damage, so it does not entail this factor based on the information provided.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 that the query is False because the query contradicts Article 545(2) regarding interest accrual on refunded monies.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query suggests a scenario where the contract for sale was cancelled due to default, and it discusses the refund of purchase money without the seller having to pay interest. However, according to Article 545, when one party exercises the right to cancel, each party must restore the other to their original state, which includes refunding monies with accrued interest if applicable. The query's scenario implies obligations (refund of money) but misinterprets the obligation regarding interest payment. Thus, the defendant (seller, in this context) is indeed obligated to certain actions upon contract cancellation, such as refunding the purchase money with interest, contrary to what the query suggests.

Given the misunderstanding about interest, the query still acknowledges a form of obligation (pledged), even if incorrectly described. Therefore, pledged(1).

**Output:**

- Query entails 1
- Not pledged for factors 2, 3 (contradicts), 4, and 5
- pledged(1)

 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

6. The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandate is terminated during the course of performance.

Number of factors : 6

Verdict: The mandatary's right to claim remuneration depends on the presence of special agreements, completion of mandated business, and specific circumstances such as termination or inability to perform.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 648, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 is present, indicating that there are no special agreements between the mandatary and the mandator. According to the article, in the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator. Therefore, the defendant (mandatary) is not obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2 and 3 are present, indicating that the mandatary is to receive remuneration only if specified in an agreement and may not claim remuneration until after having performed the mandated business. However, since factor 1 (absence of special agreements) is implicitly included due to factor 2, and there's no completion or partial performance mentioned, the defendant (mandatary) cannot claim remuneration and thus is not obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 4 is present, indicating that the remuneration is specified with reference to a period. Although the article mentions applying Article 624, paragraph (2) mutatis mutandis, it implies a basis for remuneration calculation exists, suggesting an agreement or provision for payment. Therefore, under this condition, assuming the periods have passed or conditions met as per Article 624, paragraph (2), the defendant could be considered obligated to provide remuneration.

(5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factor 5 is present, indicating that the mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if they are no longer able to perform due to grounds not attributable to the mandator. This directly supports the defendant's obligation to pay remuneration for the work completed.

(2, 4, 6 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2, 4, and 6 are present, indicating a specified remuneration agreement (factor 2), remuneration based on periods with reference to Article 624, paragraph (2) (factor 4), and the mandate being terminated during performance (factor 6). Given these conditions, especially with factor 6 allowing for proportional payment upon termination, the defendant is obligated to provide remuneration according to the proportions of work completed.

(1, 3, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1, 3, and 5 are present. Although factor 1 suggests no special agreements, factors 3 and 5 introduce conditions (completion of mandated business and inability to perform due to non-attributable grounds) that lead to an entitlement to remuneration proportionate to the performance already completed. The presence of factor 5 specifically overrides the general rule in factor 1 by providing a basis for claiming remuneration, thus making the defendant obligated under these combined conditions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False

The query states that even with an agreement for remuneration between a mandator and a mandatary, if the mandatary cancels the contract during performance, they cannot demand payment of remuneration. However, according to Article 648(3)(ii), if the mandate is terminated during the course of performance, the mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed. This suggests that the query is False because it contradicts the provision allowing for proportional remuneration upon termination.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **In the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator.**  
   The query does not directly address this scenario since it mentions consent (implying an agreement) has been reached for payment.

2. **The mandatary is to receive remuneration only if specified in an agreement.**  
   The query implies there's an agreement, so it indirectly considers this factor but doesn't directly express the conditionality of remuneration on such agreements.

3. **The mandatary may not claim remuneration until after having performed the mandated business.**  
   This is not directly relevant to the scenario described in the query, which focuses on cancellation during performance.

4. **If the remuneration is specified with reference to period, the provisions of Article 624, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis.**  
   The query does not mention anything about periodic remuneration or reference to other articles, so it doesn't express this factor.

5. **The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandatary is no longer able to perform the mandated business due to any grounds not attributable to the mandator.**  
   The query doesn't specifically address inability to perform due to external reasons, so it does not express this factor.

6. **The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandate is terminated during the course of performance.**  
   (query entails 6) - This is directly relevant as the query discusses termination but incorrectly states that no remuneration can be demanded, contradicting this factor.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the query's scenario and its contradiction with Article 648(3)(ii), it suggests the mandatary could still have a claim for proportional remuneration upon termination. However, based on the direct wording of the query which states the mandatary "cannot demand payment of remuneration," it seems to imply no obligation on the part of the defendant (mandator) to pay remuneration under the described conditions. Thus, according to the logic presented in the query itself (but not aligning with the legal article's stipulations), the answer would be **pledged(0)**, indicating the query does not determine the defendant obligated to pay remuneration in the scenario it describes.

However, considering the correct interpretation of Article 648 and the factors involved, the assessment from Task 1 that the query is False highlights a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the legal principle regarding termination and remuneration. The actual legal stance supports the mandatary's right to proportional remuneration upon termination during performance, which would typically imply an obligation on the part of the mandator under such conditions, contradicting the **pledged(0)** conclusion based solely on the query's statement.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article or provision, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases, ensuring that each represents a factor used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article.

Here are the factors:

1. The provisions of Article 551 apply mutatis mutandis to loans for use.
2. The donor is presumed to have promised to deliver or transfer the thing or right that is the subject matter of the gift, while maintaining its condition as of the time when it is specified as the subject matter of the gift.
3. With respect to gifts with burden, the donor provides the same warranty as that of a seller, to the extent of that burden.

Number of factors : 3

Note: There are no verdict sentences in the provided text. If there were, I would format them as "Verdict: <sentence>". However, since the text only provides factors and explanations, there is no verdict sentence to report.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate three legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 applies, which states that the provisions of Article 551 apply mutatis mutandis to loans for use. This implies that the donor's obligations under a loan for use are similar to those under a gift, as outlined in Article 551. Therefore, if the defendant is a donor who has made a loan for use, they would be legally obligated to fulfill their duties under the loan.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 2 applies, which states that the donor is presumed to have promised to deliver or transfer the thing or right that is the subject matter of the gift. However, this presumption does not necessarily imply an obligation on the part of the defendant, as it merely sets out a default expectation. Without additional factors indicating a specific burden or warranty, the defendant would not be considered legally obligated.

(1, 3 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 and 3 apply. Factor 1 establishes that the provisions of Article 551 apply to loans for use, while factor 3 states that with respect to gifts with burden, the donor provides the same warranty as that of a seller. If the defendant has made a loan for use with a burden (e.g., a requirement to maintain or return the item in a certain condition), they would be obligated to provide a warranty similar to that of a seller, and therefore would be legally obligated.

Note: I have ensured that no two cases use the same combination of factors, as required.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that in the case where the lender knew about any latent defect in the subject matter of a loan for use, he/she is released from the warranty against defects if he/she disclosed its existence to the borrower. 

Given Article 596 and Article 551, we understand that the provisions related to gifts also apply to loans for use (mutatis mutandis), and with respect to gifts (or in this context, loans) with burden, the donor (or lender) provides a warranty similar to that of a seller, up to the extent of that burden. However, there's no direct mention of what happens if the lender discloses known defects.

In typical legal frameworks, disclosure of known defects can indeed release the seller or lender from certain liabilities related to those defects, as it allows the borrower to make an informed decision. Thus, based on general principles and without a specific article directly addressing this scenario, one might logically infer that disclosing latent defects could release the lender from warranty obligations related to those defects.

Therefore, without explicit contradiction in the provided articles, we can reason that the query is likely True under general legal principles, assuming disclosure of known defects typically mitigates liability.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The provisions of Article 551 apply mutatis mutandis to loans for use.**
   - (query entails 1) The query indirectly considers this by discussing loans for use in the context of warranties, implying an application similar to gifts as per Article 551.

2. **The donor is presumed to have promised to deliver or transfer the thing or right that is the subject matter of the gift, while maintaining its condition as of the time when it is specified as the subject matter of the gift.**
   - (query entails 2) The query considers a scenario where the lender's knowledge and action (disclosure of defects) impact the condition or understanding of the loan, aligning with the concept of maintaining the condition at the time of specification.

3. **With respect to gifts with burden, the donor provides the same warranty as that of a seller, to the extent of that burden.**
   - (query entails 3) The query directly addresses the concept of warranty in loans for use by discussing the release from warranty obligations upon disclosure of defects, which parallels the warranty provided by a seller.

Justifications align with the logical reasoning in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is True based on general legal principles and the factors outlined.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context, if the lender discloses known defects, they are released from warranty obligations related to those defects. This implies a specific condition under which the lender's obligations are altered, rather than universally obligating or not obligating the defendant (lender in this case).

However, since the query discusses conditions under which the lender is "released" from obligations, it suggests that without such disclosure, the lender might be obligated to provide warranty against defects. Thus, the query does imply a scenario where the defendant could be considered obligated under certain circumstances (lack of disclosure), but specifically addresses a condition leading to release from obligation.

Therefore, considering the specific scenario of disclosure leading to release from obligations:
- **pledged(0)** if we focus strictly on the outcome of disclosure.
- But acknowledging that without disclosure, there might be an obligation, the query indirectly touches upon potential obligations based on the actions (or lack thereof) of the lender. 

Given the direct question context, though, the focus is on the release from obligation due to disclosure:
**pledged(0)**

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. The seller makes a special agreement to the effect that the seller does not warrant in the case prescribed in the main clause of Article 562, paragraph (1) or Article 565.
2. The seller knew but did not disclose a fact.
3. The seller personally created a right for a third party.
4. The seller assigned a right to a third party.

These factors are crucial in determining the verdict in cases where the article is applied. 

<Number of factors : 4>

Verdict: The seller may not be released from that responsibility with respect to any fact that the seller knew but did not disclose, and with respect to any right that the seller personally created for or assigned to a third party.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 4 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the seller makes a special agreement to the effect that the seller does not warrant in the case prescribed in the main clause of Article 562, paragraph (1) or Article 565. However, according to the article, even with such an agreement, the seller may still be responsible if they knew but did not disclose a fact, personally created a right for a third party, or assigned a right to a third party. Since factor 1 is present, and it is possible that one of the other factors could also be present (even though we're not assuming any others are), the seller's attempt to waive responsibility may not be effective, and they may still be obligated.

(2 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the seller knew but did not disclose a fact. According to the article, if the seller knew but did not disclose a fact, they may not be released from that responsibility, even if they made a special agreement to waive warranty. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(3 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the seller personally created a right for a third party. The article states that the seller may not be released from responsibility with respect to any right that the seller personally created for or assigned to a third party. Since factor 3 is present, the defendant is obligated.

(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the seller knew but did not disclose a fact (factor 2), and the seller assigned a right to a third party (factor 4). The article clearly states that the seller may not be released from responsibility in either of these situations. With both factors present, it is clear that the defendant is obligated.

Note: I've made sure that no two cases use the same combination of factors and provided a justification for each case based on the occurrence of the factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determining the Query's Truth Value Based on Logical Reasoning

The query posits that if there is a special agreement in a contract of sale stating the seller will not provide warranties against defects, and the seller knew but did not disclose a latent defect in the subject matter of the sale, then he/she may not be released from the warranties against defects. This aligns with the principle outlined in Article 572, which states that even with such an agreement, the seller cannot escape responsibility for facts they knew but did not disclose or rights they personally created or assigned to a third party.

Based on this reasoning, the query is **True** because it accurately reflects the legal principle stated in Article 572 regarding the seller's responsibilities despite any special agreements to the contrary.

### Task 2: Assessing Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The seller makes a special agreement to the effect that the seller does not warrant in the case prescribed in the main clause of Article 562, paragraph (1) or Article 565.**
   - The query mentions "a special agreement... to the effect that the seller will not provide the warranties against defects," which directly aligns with this factor.
   - **Query entails factor 1.**

2. **The seller knew but did not disclose a fact.**
   - The query states "if the seller knew but did not disclose that there is any latent defect in the subject matter of a sale," which matches this condition.
   - **Query entails factor 2.**

3. **The seller personally created a right for a third party.**
   - This factor is not mentioned or implied in the query, as it focuses on non-disclosure of defects rather than creation of rights for third parties.
   - The query does not entail factor 3.

4. **The seller assigned a right to a third party.**
   - Similar to factor 3, this aspect is not covered by the query, which concentrates on the issue of latent defects and warranties against them.
   - The query does not entail factor 4.

My justifications for factors 1 and 2 align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query's truth value is indeed **True** based on the logical reasoning provided in Article 572.

### Task 3: Determining Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given that the query outlines a scenario where the seller cannot be released from warranties against defects due to non-disclosure of a latent defect, it implies that the defendant (seller) is obligated to uphold those warranties despite any special agreement to the contrary.

Therefore, **pledged(1)**, indicating that the query determines the defendant (seller) is indeed obligated.

 To break down Article 379 into its constituent factors for determining verdicts in relevant cases:

1. A third party acquirer of a mortgaged immovables is mentioned.
2. The third party acquirer has the right to make a claim.
3. The claim is specifically for the extinguishment of a mortgage.
4. The process for making this claim is prescribed in Article 383.

Given these factors, we can determine that there are a total of 4 key points that influence how Article 379 is applied.

<Number of factors : 4>

Verdict: A third party acquirer of a mortgaged immovables may make a claim for the extinguishment of a mortgage as prescribed in Article 383.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the factors of Article 379, we will create combinations of these factors to determine the legal obligation of the defendant in each scenario. The factors are:

1. A third party acquirer of a mortgaged immovables is mentioned.
2. The third party acquirer has the right to make a claim.
3. The claim is specifically for the extinguishment of a mortgage.
4. The process for making this claim is prescribed in Article 383.

Given there are 4 factors, we will generate 4 unique case scenarios where each scenario involves a different combination of these factors, ensuring no two cases use the same combination.

### Case Scenario 1: (1, 2 | Y)
In this scenario, a third party acquirer of a mortgaged immovable exists (Factor 1), and this acquirer has the right to make a claim (Factor 2). Although the specifics of the claim and the process for making it are not mentioned, the presence of a third-party acquirer with the right to make a claim suggests an intent to utilize legal processes related to mortgaged properties. Given these factors, the defendant is likely obligated to recognize the acquirer's rights and prepare to address potential claims.

### Case Scenario 2: (3, 4 | Y)
Here, the claim is specifically for the extinguishment of a mortgage (Factor 3), and the process for making this claim is prescribed in Article 383 (Factor 4). This scenario directly involves the legal mechanism for addressing mortgage extinguishments, implying that the defendant is involved in a formal legal process. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to follow the legal procedures outlined for such claims.

### Case Scenario 3: (1, 3 | N)
In this case, there is a third party acquirer of a mortgaged immovable (Factor 1), and the claim is for the extinguishment of a mortgage (Factor 3). However, without the explicit right to make a claim or reference to a prescribed legal process, it's unclear if the defendant has a legal obligation to act on this claim. The absence of clear legal standing or process means the defendant may not be obligated in the same way as scenarios with more defined legal parameters.

### Case Scenario 4: (2, 4 | Y)
This scenario involves the third party acquirer having the right to make a claim (Factor 2) and the process for making this claim being prescribed in Article 383 (Factor 4). The combination of a recognized legal right to claim and a defined legal process indicates that the defendant is legally obligated to acknowledge and participate in the claim process as outlined by law.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation.

 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given Article 379 and the factors broken down from it, we understand that a third party acquirer of mortgaged immovables has the right to make a claim for the extinguishment of a mortgage. The query states, "Holders of superficies created upon mortgaged real estates may not make a claim for the extinction of the mortgage." Since Article 379 specifically mentions "a third party acquirer of a mortgaged immovables" and does not explicitly include holders of superficies within this category, we can infer that the query is True. This is because the article does not provide direct evidence to support the claim of holders of superficies having the right to extinguish a mortgage.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning for all factors.

1. **A third party acquirer of a mortgaged immovables is mentioned.**
   - (query does not entail 1) The query talks about holders of superficies, which are not explicitly mentioned as third-party acquirers in Article 379.

2. **The third party acquirer has the right to make a claim.**
   - (query does not entail 2) The query states that holders of superficies may not make a claim, which directly contradicts the premise of this factor.

3. **The claim is specifically for the extinguishment of a mortgage.**
   - (query entails 3) The query mentions "the extinction of the mortgage," aligning with the concept of making a claim for the extinguishment of a mortgage as stated in Article 379.

4. **The process for making this claim is prescribed in Article 383.**
   - (query does not entail 4) There's no mention or implication regarding the process for holders of superficies to make any claims according to Article 383, as they are not considered within the scope of those who can make such claims based on Article 379.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 that the query is True because it accurately reflects a scenario (holders of superficies not being able to claim for mortgage extinction) not contradicted by Article 379 and its factors.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context, the query "Holders of superficies created upon mortgaged real estates may not make a claim for the extinction of the mortgage" does not directly imply an obligation on any party (defendant) to perform or refrain from performing a specific action. Instead, it states a limitation on who can make certain claims regarding mortgages. Therefore, it does not determine a defendant as obligated in the sense of having a duty or responsibility that could lead to legal consequences for non-compliance.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The duration of a farming right is 20 years or more and 50 years or less, which implies a minimum commitment. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated to respect this duration.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Although an act of establishment may provide for a period longer than 50 years, the law limits it to 50 years. Additionally, the establishment of a farming right may be renewed. However, these factors combined do not necessarily imply an obligation, as renewal is optional and the duration limit applies regardless.

(4 | Y)
Justification: The duration of a renewed farming right may not exceed 50 years from the time of renewal. This implies that if the defendant renews the farming right, they are obligated to respect this new duration limit.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: The duration of a farming right is 20 years or more and 50 years or less, and if an act of establishment does not provide for the duration, a default duration applies. This combination implies that the defendant is obligated to respect either the specified or default duration.

(6 | Y)
Justification: The default duration of a farming right is 30 years unless there are other customs to the contrary. In the absence of other customs, the defendant is obligated to respect this default duration.

(2, 6 | N)
Justification: Although an act of establishment may provide for a period longer than 50 years (limited to 50 years), and the default duration is 30 years, these factors combined do not necessarily imply an obligation. The law limits the duration to 50 years regardless of the act's provision, and the default duration applies only in the absence of other specifications.

(3, 7 | Y)
Justification: The establishment of a farming right may be renewed, and other customs may override the default duration of 30 years. If the defendant renews the farming right under a custom that overrides the default duration, they are obligated to respect the terms of that custom and the renewal.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors, yielding a clear verdict regarding the defendant's obligation.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the article and the query "A farming right may not be established gratuitously," we must analyze if the article provides any information that directly or indirectly supports or refutes this statement. The article discusses the duration of farming rights, renewal possibilities, and default durations but does not explicitly mention whether a farming right can be established gratuitously (without payment or compensation). Therefore, based solely on the provided text, we cannot conclude that the query is true or false with absolute certainty because the article does not address the issue of gratuity in establishing farming rights.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The duration of a farming right is 20 years or more and 50 years or less.**  
   - The query does not express this factor because it discusses the possibility of establishment without compensation, not the duration.

2. **An act of establishment may provide for a period longer than 50 years, but the duration is still limited to 50 years.**  
   - The query does not express this factor as it pertains to duration limitations, not the method or terms of establishment like gratuity.

3. **The establishment of a farming right may be renewed.**  
   - The query does not express this factor since renewal possibilities are unrelated to whether an establishment can be gratuitous.

4. **The duration of a renewed farming right may not exceed 50 years from the time of renewal.**  
   - Similar to factor 3, the query does not address renewal durations but rather the conditions under which a farming right might be established.

5. **If an act of establishment does not provide for the duration of the farming right, a default duration applies.**  
   - The query is unrelated to this factor as it concerns default durations in the absence of specified terms, not the nature of the establishment (gratuitous or not).

6. **The default duration of a farming right is 30 years unless there are other customs to the contrary.**  
   - This factor is about default durations and does not pertain to whether an establishment can be done without compensation.

7. **Other customs may override the default duration of 30 years.**  
   - The query does not express this factor since it deals with potential variations in duration due to local customs, which is separate from the concept of gratuitous establishment.

Given these assessments, none of the factors directly relate to the query about whether a farming right may be established gratuitously. Therefore, the justifications align with the initial assessment that the article does not provide sufficient information to determine the truth value of the query based on the factors listed.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query "A farming right may not be established gratuitously" implies a condition or restriction on how a farming right can be established but does not directly state an obligation for a defendant in a legal context. However, if interpreted as a rule that no one can establish a farming right without compensation, it could imply that someone attempting to do so (potentially a defendant) would be obligated to provide compensation. Yet, this interpretation stretches beyond the direct meaning of the query and the information provided by the article.

Therefore, based on the tasks and the format requested:

- The query does not directly entail any of the factors as described.
- Given the lack of direct relevance to obligations in the query as phrased and the information provided, the determination of obligation is nuanced but leans towards **pledged(0)** because the query itself does not explicitly state an obligation for a defendant. 

Thus, in terms of output:
- (query entails none of the factors 1 through 7)
- pledged(0)

 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the factors:

1. In the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator.
2. The mandatary is to receive remuneration only after having performed the mandated business.
3. If the remuneration is specified with reference to period, the provisions of Article 624, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis.
4. The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandatary is no longer able to perform the mandated business due to any grounds not attributable to the mandator.
5. The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandate is terminated during the course of performance.

Number of factors : 5

Verdict: The mandatary's right to claim remuneration depends on the presence of special agreements, the completion of the mandated business, and the application of specific provisions or circumstances.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 1 is present, which states that in the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator. Since there are no special agreements, the defendant (mandatary) is not obligated to receive remuneration.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 2 is present, which states that the mandatary is to receive remuneration only after having performed the mandated business. If the business has not been completed, the defendant (mandatary) is not yet obligated to receive remuneration.

(3 | Y)
Justification: In this case, only factor 3 is present, which states that if the remuneration is specified with reference to period, the provisions of Article 624, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis. This implies that the defendant (mandatary) is entitled to receive remuneration according to the specified period, and therefore is obligated.

(4, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors 4 and 5 are present, which state that the mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandatary is no longer able to perform the mandated business due to any grounds not attributable to the mandator, or if the mandate is terminated during the course of performance. Since both conditions are met, the defendant (mandatary) is obligated to receive proportional remuneration.

(1, 2, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, factors 1, 2, and 3 are present. Although factor 3 suggests that the defendant (mandatary) may be entitled to remuneration according to the specified period, factor 1 states that there are no special agreements, and factor 2 requires completion of the mandated business before receiving remuneration. Since these conditions are not met, the defendant (mandatary) is not obligated to receive remuneration.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a mandate contract is a gratuitous contract in principle, but if there is a special provision, the mandatary may demand remuneration from the mandator. According to Article 648(1), "In the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator." This implies that by default (or in principle), mandate contracts are indeed gratuitous, meaning no payment is expected for the services rendered. However, it also allows for exceptions based on special agreements, which aligns with the query's statement about demanding remuneration if there's a special provision.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided by Article 648, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **In the absence of any special agreements, the mandatary may not claim remuneration from the mandator.**
   - (query entails 1) The query directly addresses this by stating that a mandate contract is gratuitous in principle, implying no remuneration without special provisions.

2. **The mandatary is to receive remuneration only after having performed the mandated business.**
   - This factor is not directly addressed by the query. The query focuses on the existence of special agreements rather than the timing of remuneration.

3. **If the remuneration is specified with reference to period, the provisions of Article 624, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis.**
   - This factor is not mentioned in the query. It discusses a specific scenario related to periodic remuneration and its conditions, which the query does not cover.

4. **The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandatary is no longer able to perform the mandated business due to any grounds not attributable to the mandator.**
   - The query does not address this scenario directly. It only mentions the possibility of demanding remuneration with a special provision, without specifying conditions like inability to perform.

5. **The mandatary may demand remuneration in proportion to the performance already completed if the mandate is terminated during the course of performance.**
   - Similar to factor 4, this scenario is not directly addressed by the query. The query's focus remains on the principle of gratuitousness and exceptions via special agreements.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 in that they validate the core statement made by the query about mandate contracts being gratuitous unless there are special provisions for remuneration, but do not encompass all nuances and conditions outlined in Article 648.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context of the tasks, it seems the question revolves around whether the mandatary (potentially considered as the defendant in a dispute over remuneration) is obligated to receive or can demand remuneration under certain conditions. The query itself suggests that without special provisions, there's no obligation for the mandator to pay remuneration, aligning with the idea of a gratuitous contract.

However, interpreting this task in the context provided and focusing strictly on whether the query implies an obligation (pledged) for remuneration based on special agreements:

- **Pledged(1)** if the query implies there's an obligation under certain conditions.
- **Pledged(0)** if it suggests no such obligation exists.

Given that the query indicates a possibility of demanding remuneration with a special provision, but doesn't inherently imply an automatic obligation for payment in all cases (since it starts from the premise of gratuitousness), the interpretation could lean towards **pledged(0)**. This is because the query's primary stance is on the principle of mandate contracts being gratuitous unless otherwise agreed upon, rather than imposing an obligation for remuneration.

Therefore, based on the given instructions and interpretations:
- Task 1: The query is **True**.
- Task 2: Specific entailed factors have been identified with justifications provided.
- Task 3: **pledged(0)**.

(1) If a guarantor gives guarantee as requested by the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation without giving prior notice to the principal obligor, the principal obligor may assert against the guarantor any defense that could have been asserted against the obligee. In such a case, if the principal obligor asserts a set-off against the guarantor, the guarantor may request the obligee to perform the obligation which should have been extinguished due to the set-off.
(2) If a guarantor gives guarantee as requested by the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation in good faith because of the principal obligor's failure to notify the guarantor of the principal obligor's performance of an act for extinguishment of obligation, the guarantor may deem that the guarantor's own act for extinguishment of obligation is valid.
(3) If the principal obligor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation after the guarantor has performed an act for extinguishment of obligation, the principal obligor may deem that the guarantor's own act for extinguishment of obligation is valid, not only if the guarantor has given guarantee against the will of the principal obligor but also if the principal obligor has performed an act for extinguishment of obligation in good faith because of the guarantor's failure to notify the principal obligor of the guarantor's performance of act for extinguishment of obligation.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 11 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The guarantor gives guarantee as requested by the principal obligor, which implies that the guarantor has taken on a level of responsibility for the obligation. Therefore, the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation without giving prior notice to the principal obligor, and the principal obligor may assert against the guarantor any defense that could have been asserted against the obligee. This suggests that the guarantor's actions have consequences, and the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated.

(4, 5 | N)
Justification: The principal obligor asserts a set-off against the guarantor, but the guarantor requests the obligee to perform the obligation which should have been extinguished due to the set-off. This indicates that the guarantor is attempting to shift responsibility back to the obligee, and therefore the defendant (guarantor) is not legally obligated.

(6 | Y)
Justification: The guarantor gives guarantee as requested by the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation in good faith. The guarantor's good faith efforts suggest that they have acted responsibly, and the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated.

(7, 8 | Y)
Justification: The performance of the act for extinguishment of obligation is due to the principal obligor's failure to notify the guarantor of the principal obligor's performance of an act for extinguishment of obligation, and the guarantor deems that the guarantor's own act for extinguishment of obligation is valid. This implies that the guarantor has taken reasonable steps, and the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated.

(9 | Y)
Justification: The principal obligor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation after the guarantor has performed an act for extinguishment of obligation. This suggests that the guarantor's actions have been superseded by the principal obligor's, and the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated.

(10 | N)
Justification: The guarantor has given guarantee against the will of the principal obligor. This implies that the guarantor has acted without the principal obligor's consent, and therefore the defendant (guarantor) is not legally obligated.

(1, 6 | Y)
Justification: The guarantor gives guarantee as requested by the principal obligor, and the guarantor gives guarantee as requested by the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation in good faith. These factors together suggest that the guarantor has acted responsibly and with the principal obligor's consent, and the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated.

(3, 9 | Y)
Justification: The principal obligor may assert against the guarantor any defense that could have been asserted against the obligee, and the principal obligor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation after the guarantor has performed an act for extinguishment of obligation. These factors together imply that the guarantor's actions have consequences, and the defendant (guarantor) is legally obligated.

(2, 7 | Y)
Justification: The guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation without giving prior notice to the principal obligor, and the performance of the act for extinguishment of obligation is due to the principal obligor's failure to notify the guarantor of the principal obligor's performance of an act for extinguishment of obligation. These factors together suggest that there has been a breakdown in communication between the parties, but the defendant (guarantor) is still legally obligated.

(4, 11 | N)
Justification: The principal obligor asserts a set-off against the guarantor, and the principal obligor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation in good faith because of the guarantor's failure to notify the principal obligor of the guarantor's performance of act for extinguishment of obligation. These factors together imply that the guarantor has failed to act responsibly, but the principal obligor's good faith efforts suggest that the defendant (guarantor) is not legally obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's proceed step by step:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

Given the scenario in the query, where C becomes a guarantor for A's debt of 5 million yen to B at A's request, and then C performs this obligation without notifying A, who had intended to set off their own claim of 3 million yen against B, we need to assess if A can refuse reimbursement to C up to 3 million yen by asserting a set-off.

According to Article 463(1), if a guarantor gives a guarantee as requested by the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation without giving prior notice to the principal obligor, the principal obligor may assert against the guarantor any defense that could have been asserted against the obligee. This includes asserting a set-off.

Therefore, logically, if A (the principal obligor) had a claim against B (the obligee) that could be set off against the debt for which C is the guarantor, and C performed the obligation without notice to A, then A can indeed assert this set-off against C. This makes the query **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **A guarantor gives guarantee as requested by the principal obligor.**
   - (query entails 1) because C becomes a guarantor at A's request.

2. **The guarantor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation without giving prior notice to the principal obligor.**
   - (query entails 2) since C performs the obligation without notifying A.

3. **The principal obligor may assert against the guarantor any defense that could have been asserted against the obligee.**
   - (query entails 3) as A asserts a set-off, which is a defense against B, now against C.

4. **The principal obligor asserts a set-off against the guarantor.**
   - (query entails 4) because A refuses reimbursement to C by asserting a set-off.

5. **The guarantor requests the obligee to perform the obligation which should have been extinguished due to the set-off.**
   - The query does not directly mention this scenario, so it does not entail factor 5.

6. **A guarantor gives guarantee as requested by the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation in good faith.**
   - While C acts as a guarantor at A's request, the query doesn't specify "in good faith" due to lack of notification from A about performing an act for extinguishment, so it partially entails factor 6 but not fully in context.

7. **The performance of the act for extinguishment of obligation is due to the principal obligor's failure to notify the guarantor of the principal obligor's performance of an act for extinguishment of obligation.**
   - The query does imply C acted without knowing A's intentions, so (query entails 7) in a broad sense.

8. **The guarantor deems that the guarantor's own act for extinguishment of obligation is valid.**
   - This factor isn't directly addressed by the query; it focuses on A's right to assert set-off against C, not C's perspective on their action's validity.

9. **The principal obligor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation after the guarantor has performed an act for extinguishment of obligation.**
   - This scenario is not described in the query, so it does not entail factor 9.

10. **The guarantor has given guarantee against the will of the principal obligor.**
    - The query specifies C gave the guarantee at A's request, so (query does not entail 10).

11. **The principal obligor performs an act for extinguishment of obligation in good faith because of the guarantor's failure to notify the principal obligor of the guarantor's performance of act for extinguishment of obligation.**
    - This factor isn't directly relevant as described; the query focuses on A's set-off right due to C's action without notice, not A performing an act for extinguishment after being uninformed by C.

These assessments generally align with the logical reasoning provided in Task 1, supporting the conclusion that the query is True based on Article 463(1).

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the scenario and analysis, A (the principal obligor) can refuse reimbursement to C (the guarantor) up to 3 million yen by asserting a set-off. This implies that C, as the guarantor who acted without notice to A, could be obligated to accept this set-off as a valid defense against full reimbursement.

Therefore, **pledged(1)** because the query scenario does determine an obligation on the part of the defendant (C, in terms of accepting a reduced reimbursement due to A's set-off).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases, each representing a factor used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the factors:

1. A building is constructed on a mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage.
2. The mortgagee may auction the building together with the land.
3. The right of priority of the mortgagee may be exercised solely against the proceeds of the land.
4. The owner of the building has rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land.
5. The owner's rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land may be duly asserted against the mortgagee.

<Number of factors : 5>

Verdict: The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the owner of that building has rights with respect to the possession of the mortgaged land that may be duly asserted against the mortgagee.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs, meaning a building is constructed on a mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage. According to Article 389, this allows the mortgagee to auction the building together with the land. Since no other factors are present to limit or negate this right, the defendant (mortgagee) is legally obligated to proceed with the auction.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 2 occurs, meaning the mortgagee may auction the building together with the land. However, without factor 1 being present, there's no basis for the mortgagee's right to auction the building. The article does not independently grant this right without a building being constructed on mortgaged land after the creation of a mortgage. Thus, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(3 | N)
Justification: Factor 3 states that the right of priority of the mortgagee may be exercised solely against the proceeds of the land. Without factors 1 and 2 present, which establish the context for auctioning the building and land, factor 3 alone does not impose an obligation on the defendant to exercise this right. The defendant's actions are contingent upon the occurrence of other factors.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 and 4 occur. Factor 1 allows the mortgagee to consider auctioning the building with the land, but factor 4 introduces the owner's rights regarding possession of the mortgaged land. However, for the provisions not to apply (as per the verdict), factor 5 must also be present, indicating these rights can be asserted against the mortgagee. Without factor 5, we cannot conclude that the defendant is exempt from the obligations related to auctioning the property. Yet, given the information provided by factors 1 and 4, it leans towards an interpretation where the defendant might not have a clear obligation due to potential counterclaims or rights from the building's owner.

(2, 3, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2, 3, and 5 occur. Factor 2 allows the mortgagee to auction the building with the land, factor 3 clarifies that the mortgagee's priority right is against the land's proceeds, and factor 5 indicates the owner of the building has assertable rights against the mortgagee regarding the land's possession. Given these conditions, especially with factor 5 being present, it suggests a complex scenario where the defendant (mortgagee) must navigate the auction process while respecting the owner's rights. The presence of factor 5 implies that the usual provisions allowing the mortgagee to auction without full consideration of the building owner's rights do not apply, suggesting a legal obligation for the defendant to handle the situation with these limitations in mind.

(1, 2, 3 | Y)
Justification: This scenario includes factors 1, 2, and 3. With a building constructed on mortgaged land after the mortgage creation (factor 1), the mortgagee has the right to auction the building together with the land (factor 2). Furthermore, the mortgagee's priority right is exercisable solely against the proceeds of the land (factor 3). The combination of these factors provides a clear basis for the defendant's legal obligation to proceed with the auction as described, without any mentioned limitations or exemptions based on the building owner's rights.

According to Article 32(1), the family court must rescind the declaration of disappearance upon receiving such proof. Therefore, the defendant, who had declared the person missing, is legally obligated to comply with the rescission.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
Here, factors 2 and 3 are present: The family court receives proof that the missing person died at a time different from the time set forth in the preceding Article, and the request for rescission is made by the missing person or an interested person. Given that both conditions for rescission are met (proof of death at a different time and a valid request), the defendant is legally obligated to accept the rescission of the declaration of disappearance.

3. (4 | N)
In this scenario, only factor 4 occurs: The rescission of the declaration of disappearance does not affect the validity of any act performed in good faith after the declaration of disappearance but before the rescission thereof. Since this factor solely addresses the validity of acts performed during a specific timeframe and does not directly impose an obligation on the defendant regarding the rescission itself, the defendant is not legally obligated by this factor alone.

4. (1, 5 | Y)
This case involves factors 1 and 5: The family court receives proof that the missing person is alive, and a person who has acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance loses the rights in question due to its rescission. Given that the declaration of disappearance is rescinded because the person is found alive (factor 1), and this affects property rights (factor 5), the defendant who acquired such property is legally obligated to relinquish those rights.

5. (2, 6 | Y)
Here, factors 2 and 6 are present: The family court receives proof that the missing person died at a time different from the time set forth in the preceding Article, and the person who acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance has the obligation to return that property only to the extent currently enriched. Since the rescission is justified (factor 2), and there's a provision for returning acquired property (factor 6), the defendant who acquired property under these circumstances is legally obligated to return it, but only up to the amount they are currently enriched.

6. (3, 4, 5 | Y)
In this final scenario, factors 3, 4, and 5 occur: The request for rescission is made by the missing person or an interested person, the rescission does not affect the validity of acts performed in good faith after the declaration but before the rescission, and a person who has acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance loses those rights upon its rescission. Given that there's a valid request for rescission (factor 3), the principle that acts done in good faith remain valid (factor 4) does not negate the effect on property rights (factor 5). Therefore, the defendant who has acquired such property is legally obligated to lose those rights following the rescission.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors from Article 32, leading to determinate verdicts regarding the legal obligations of the defendants involved.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

Given Article 32 and the scenario where A was found to be alive after being deemed dead due to disappearance but then died before the adjudication of disappearance could be rescinded, we examine if the adjudication of disappearance may no longer be rescinded. 

Article 32(1) states that the family court must rescind the declaration of a person's disappearance if proof is received that the missing person is alive or died at a different time than initially stated. However, it does not explicitly address what happens if the person dies after being found alive but before the rescission process is initiated or completed.

Logical reasoning suggests that since A was found to be alive, there would indeed be grounds for rescinding the declaration of disappearance based on Article 32(1). The fact that A then died doesn't negate the proof that A was alive at some point after the initial declaration. However, the article does not specify procedures or outcomes for situations where the subject's status changes multiple times (alive, then dead again) before legal actions can be taken.

Therefore, based on the information provided and logical reasoning, it seems the query might lean towards being true in suggesting that under certain interpretations, the adjudication of disappearance may no longer be rescinded after A's second death, but this interpretation heavily depends on how one reads the implications of Article 32 for multiple status changes before legal resolution.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The family court must rescind the declaration of a person's disappearance if proof is received that the missing person is alive.**
   - (query entails 1) The query implies this by mentioning A was found to be alive, which directly relates to the condition for rescission.

2. **The family court must rescind the declaration of a person's disappearance if proof is received that the missing person died at a time different from the time set forth in the preceding Article.**
   - The query does not directly express this factor since it focuses on A being found alive and then dying, rather than the timing of death.

3. **The request for rescission can be made by the missing person or an interested person.**
   - (query entails 3) Although indirectly, the scenario implies a situation where a request could be made (by A or an interested party), but it doesn't explicitly state who would make this request in the given scenario.

4. **The rescission of the declaration of disappearance does not affect the validity of any act performed in good faith after the declaration of disappearance but before the rescission thereof.**
   - The query does not express this factor, as it discusses the possibility of not rescinding the declaration due to A's death rather than acts performed during the period of declared disappearance.

5. **A person who has acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance loses the rights in question due to its rescission.**
   - (query entails 5) The query touches on the concept of rescission, which implies that any changes (like acquisition of property) made because of the initial declaration could be reversed.

6. **The person who acquired property due to a declaration of disappearance has the obligation to return that property only to the extent currently enriched.**
   - The query does not directly express this factor since it doesn't discuss property rights or obligations following rescission.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the scenario and focusing on the legal obligation related to the declaration of disappearance, there's no direct mention of a defendant being obligated in a manner that aligns with typical legal obligations (e.g., returning property). The query primarily deals with the procedural aspect of rescinding a declaration of disappearance rather than assigning obligations.

Therefore, **pledged(0)**, as the query does not explicitly determine or imply a specific legal obligation on a defendant regarding the scenario described.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases, each representing a factor used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. Damage is caused to the leased thing after the lessee receives it.
2. The damage excludes any wear of the leased thing caused by the ordinary manner of using and making profit from it.
3. The damage excludes any aging degradation of the leased thing.
4. The lessee has an obligation to restore the damaged thing when the lease is terminated, provided that certain conditions are met.
5. The obligation to restore the damaged thing does not apply if the damage is caused due to grounds not attributable to the lessee.

<Number of factors : 5>

Verdict: The lessee has an obligation to restore the damaged thing when the lease is terminated; provided, however, that this does not apply if the damage is caused due to any grounds not attributable to the lessee.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the given factors from Article 621, we will create combinations of these factors to determine the obligation of the lessee in each scenario. Since there are 5 factors, we aim to create unique combinations that lead to a clear verdict in each case.

### Case Scenarios:

1. **Damage Occurs and Lessee is Responsible**  
   (1, 4 | Y)  
   Justification: In this scenario, damage is caused to the leased thing after the lessee receives it (Factor 1), and we consider the condition where the lessee has an obligation to restore the damaged thing when the lease is terminated (Factor 4). Since the damage occurred while in the possession of the lessee and no exemptions are considered, the lessee is obligated to restore the leased thing.

2. **Exemption Due to Ordinary Use**  
   (1, 2 | N)  
   Justification: Here, damage occurs after the lessee receives the leased thing (Factor 1), but it excludes any wear caused by the ordinary manner of using and making profit from it (Factor 2). Given that the article exempts damages resulting from normal use, the lessee is not obligated to restore the leased thing in this scenario.

3. **Aging Degradation Exemption**  
   (1, 3 | N)  
   Justification: In this case, damage occurs after the lessee receives the item (Factor 1), and it excludes any aging degradation of the leased thing (Factor 3). The article specifically mentions that aging degradation does not obligate the lessee to restore the leased thing; thus, the lessee is not obligated.

4. **Lessee's Obligation with Conditions**  
   (2, 4 | Y)  
   Justification: Although this scenario might seem counterintuitive because it includes an exemption (Factor 2), when combined with the general obligation to restore upon lease termination (Factor 4), we consider a situation where despite normal wear being exempt, other forms of damage not covered by exemptions occur. Thus, for any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear, the lessee is obligated to restore.

5. **No Obligation Due to Non-attributable Grounds**  
   (1, 5 | N)  
   Justification: In this scenario, damage occurs after the lessee receives the leased thing (Factor 1), but it was caused due to grounds not attributable to the lessee (Factor 5). According to the article, if the damage is not the lessee's fault, they are not obligated to restore the damaged thing.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors that lead to a determinate verdict regarding the lessee's obligation to restore the leased thing upon termination of the lease.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the process step by step:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states, "If The lessee is not obligated to restore any wear of the leased thing caused by the ordinary manner of using and making profit from it when the lease is terminated." According to Article 621, damage excludes "any wear of the leased thing caused by the ordinary manner of using and making profit from it," which implies that the lessee is indeed not obligated to restore such wear. Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **Damage is caused to the leased thing after the lessee receives it.**
   - The query does not directly address this condition but focuses on a specific type of damage (wear due to ordinary use). Thus, it doesn't fully express this factor.
   - (query entails 1) is False.

2. **The damage excludes any wear of the leased thing caused by the ordinary manner of using and making profit from it.**
   - The query directly addresses this condition by stating that the lessee is not obligated to restore such wear, aligning with Article 621.
   - (query entails 2) is True.

3. **The damage excludes any aging degradation of the leased thing.**
   - Similar to factor 1, the query doesn't specifically mention aging degradation but focuses on wear due to use. Thus, it doesn't fully express this factor.
   - (query entails 3) is False.

4. **The lessee has an obligation to restore the damaged thing when the lease is terminated, provided that certain conditions are met.**
   - The query actually states a condition under which the lessee is NOT obligated to restore damage (wear from ordinary use), rather than affirming an obligation.
   - (query entails 4) is False.

5. **The obligation to restore the damaged thing does not apply if the damage is caused due to grounds not attributable to the lessee.**
   - The query doesn't address the issue of attribution of damage causes, focusing instead on a specific type of non-obligation (wear from ordinary use).
   - (query entails 5) is False.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1 in that they demonstrate an understanding of when obligations do and do not apply according to Article 621, supporting the conclusion that the query is true regarding the lessee's lack of obligation for certain types of damage.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the query states a condition under which the lessee is **not** obligated (wear from ordinary use), it implies that the lessee is not obligated in this specific scenario. Therefore, the representation should be **pledged(0)**, indicating the defendant (lessee) is not obligated according to the query's conditions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 663, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. The parties have not specified the timing of the return of the bailed thing.
2. The bailee may return the bailed thing at any time if the parties have not specified the timing of the return.
3. The timing of the return is specified.
4. The bailee may not return the deposited thing prior to the due date.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 663, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, only factor 1 occurs, meaning "The parties have not specified the timing of the return of the bailed thing." According to Article 663(1), if the parties have not specified the timing of the return, the bailee may return the same at any time. Therefore, the defendant (bailee) is legally obligated to return the bailed thing.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 2 occurs, meaning "The bailee may return the bailed thing at any time if the parties have not specified the timing of the return." This factor implies that the parties did not specify the timing, but it does not impose an obligation on the defendant to return the bailed thing. The defendant has the option to return it at any time but is not obligated to do so.

(3 | N)
Justification: In this case, only factor 3 occurs, meaning "The timing of the return is specified." Without any other factors present, the specification of the timing does not impose an obligation on the defendant to return the bailed thing prior to or at the due date. The defendant must wait until the due date.

(4, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, factors 3 and 4 occur, meaning "The timing of the return is specified" and "The bailee may not return the deposited thing prior to the due date." These factors imply that the parties have agreed on a specific return time, and the defendant must wait until then. The defendant is not obligated to return the bailed thing before the due date.

(5, 3 | Y)
Justification: In this case, factors 3 and 5 occur, meaning "The timing of the return is specified" and "There is a compelling reason to return the deposited thing prior to the due date." According to Article 663(2), if there is a compelling reason, the bailee may return the deposited thing prior to the due date. Therefore, despite the specified timing, the defendant is legally obligated to return the bailed thing early due to the compelling reason.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors and yields a clear verdict regarding the defendant's obligation to return the bailed thing.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states: "When the depositor died, if the timing of the return is specified, the depositary may return the deposited goods prior to the due date." 

According to Article 663(2), "If the timing of the return is specified, the bailee may not return the deposited thing prior to the due date unless there is a compelling reason to do so."

The query implies that the death of the depositor might be considered a compelling reason for returning the goods before the due date. However, Article 663 does not explicitly mention the death of the depositor as a compelling reason. Therefore, based solely on the information provided in Article 663, we cannot definitively conclude that the depositary may return the goods prior to the due date simply because the depositor died.

Thus, without additional context or legal precedent indicating that the death of a depositor constitutes a compelling reason for early return under this article, the query is considered False based on the strict interpretation of Article 663.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The parties have not specified the timing of the return of the bailed thing.**
   - (query does not entail 1) because the query specifically mentions that "the timing of the return is specified."

2. **The bailee may return the bailed thing at any time if the parties have not specified the timing of the return.**
   - (query does not entail 2) since the scenario in the query involves a specified return time.

3. **The timing of the return is specified.**
   - (query entails 3) because the query directly states this condition.

4. **The bailee may not return the deposited thing prior to the due date.**
   - (query does not entail 4) as it explores an exception to this rule, implying a possible return before the due date under certain circumstances.

5. **There is a compelling reason to return the deposited thing prior to the due date.**
   - (query entails 5) if we interpret the depositor's death as potentially being a compelling reason, although Article 663 does not explicitly list this as such.

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False under a strict interpretation of Article 663, primarily because the article does not explicitly state that a depositor's death is a compelling reason for early return.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the information and analysis, the query suggests a scenario where the depositary might consider returning goods early due to the depositor's death. However, based on Article 663, without explicit mention of the depositor's death as a compelling reason for early return, we cannot conclusively determine an obligation based solely on the provided article.

Therefore, **pledged(0)**, indicating that the query does not definitively establish an obligation under the specified conditions according to Article 663.

 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. The claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription.
2. The right is not exercised within three years from the time when the victim or legal representative thereof comes to know the damage.
3. The right is not exercised within three years from the time when the victim or legal representative thereof comes to know the identity of the perpetrator.

Number of factors : 4

Verdict: The claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription in the specified cases.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate four legal case scenarios. Here they are:


(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription, which implies that the defendant is no longer legally obligated to provide compensation if the claim is not made within the specified timeframe. However, since factor 1 is present, it sets the stage for evaluating the prescription of the claim, thus making the defendant potentially obligated to face the consequences of the claim being extinguished.


(2 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, the right is not exercised within three years from the time when the victim or legal representative thereof comes to know the damage. However, without knowing the identity of the perpetrator (factor 3) or the timeframe since the tortious act (factor 4), it's unclear whether the claim has been extinguished by prescription solely based on this factor. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine that the defendant is obligated.


(3, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, both factors 3 and 4 are present, indicating that the victim or legal representative knows the identity of the perpetrator and that more than 20 years have passed since the tortious act. According to the article, if the right is not exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act (factor 4), the claim for compensation is extinguished by prescription. Given these conditions, it's clear that the defendant would be obligated to face the consequences of the claim being extinguished.


(1, 2, 4 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves factors 1, 2, and 4. Factor 1 establishes the context of the claim being extinguished by prescription. Factor 2 indicates that the victim or legal representative failed to exercise their right within three years of knowing the damage. Factor 4 further solidifies the case by stating that more than 20 years have passed since the tortious act, which independently supports the claim being extinguished by prescription. Given these combined factors, it's reasonable to conclude that the defendant is obligated, as the conditions for the claim's extinction by prescription are met.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the information and analyze each task step by step.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that the claim for compensation for loss or damage in torts is extinguished by prescription if the obligee does not exercise the right within 20 years from the time of the tortious act. According to Article 724, specifically part (ii), it indeed states that "the right is not exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act" as one of the conditions under which the claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 724, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

Let's examine each factor in relation to the query:

1. The claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription.
   - (query entails 1) because the query directly talks about the claim being extinguished by prescription.

2. The right is not exercised within three years from the time when the victim or legal representative thereof comes to know the damage.
   - The query does not mention this specific timeframe or condition related to knowing the damage, so it does not directly entail factor 2.

3. The right is not exercised within three years from the time when the victim or legal representative thereof comes to know the identity of the perpetrator.
   - Similar to factor 2, the query does not address the timeframe related to knowing the perpetrator's identity, so it does not directly entail factor 3.

4. The right is not exercised within 20 years from the time of the tortious act.
   - (query entails 4) because the query specifically mentions this condition as a reason for the claim being extinguished by prescription.

Justification aligns with Task 1's result, confirming that while the query does not cover all factors, it accurately represents the article regarding the 20-year timeframe and the concept of prescription.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

The query discusses conditions under which a claim for compensation is extinguished by prescription but does not directly imply an obligation on the part of the defendant. It focuses on the timeframe within which the obligee (the victim or their representative) must exercise their right to claim compensation.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the nature of the query, it does not determine the defendant obligated in a direct manner that would affect their liability outside of the prescription timeframe. Hence, **pledged(0)**.

In summary:
- The query is True.
- (query entails 1) and (query entails 4).
- pledged(0).

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 8 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: If a right is acknowledged, a new period of prescription commences to run at the time of the acknowledgment. In this case, the defendant has acknowledged the right, which means they are aware of their obligation and have taken steps to restart the clock on the prescription period. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

(2, 6 | Y)
Justification: An acknowledgment of a right does not require unlimited capacity to act or authority with respect to the disposition of the right of the other party, and certain provisions apply mutatis mutandis to circumstances which arise with regard to the guarantor that bears the obligation jointly and severally with the principal obligor. In this case, the defendant has acknowledged the right without needing full capacity to act, and as a guarantor, they are also bound by the obligations of the principal obligor. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

(3 | N)
Justification: The postponement of the expiry of prescription period or the renewal of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period or to renew prescription period have arisen and their successors. In this case, the defendant may not be directly affected by the postponement or renewal, as it only applies to specific parties. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(4, 8 | Y)
Justification: The postponement of expiry of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period have arisen and their successors, and if the obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors manifest a different intention, their intention prevails with respect to the effect in relation to the remaining other joint and several obligees. In this case, the defendant is one of the parties directly affected by the postponement, and the obligee and another joint obligor have expressed a different intention that includes the defendant's obligation. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

(5 | N)
Justification: The renewal of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to renew prescription period have arisen and their successors. In this case, the defendant may not be one of the parties directly affected by the renewal, as it only applies to specific parties. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(1, 7 | Y)
Justification: If a right is acknowledged, a new period of prescription commences to run at the time of the acknowledgment, and any circumstances which have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors are not effective in relation to other joint and several obligors, except in certain cases. In this case, the defendant has acknowledged the right, which restarts the prescription period, but as a joint and several obligor, their acknowledgment does not automatically affect the obligations of the other joint obligors. However, since they have acknowledged the right, they are still legally obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: An acknowledgment of a right does not require unlimited capacity to act or authority with respect to the disposition of the right of the other party, and the postponement of the expiry of prescription period or the renewal of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period or to renew prescription period have arisen and their successors. In this case, the defendant has acknowledged the right without needing full capacity to act, but the postponement or renewal of the prescription period may not directly affect them. Therefore, the defendant is not legally obligated.

(6, 8 | Y)
Justification: Certain provisions apply mutatis mutandis to circumstances which arise with regard to the guarantor that bears the obligation jointly and severally with the principal obligor, and if the obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors manifest a different intention, their intention prevails with respect to the effect in relation to the remaining other joint and several obligees. In this case, the defendant is a guarantor who bears the obligation jointly and severally with the principal obligor, and the obligee and another joint obligor have expressed a different intention that includes the defendant's obligation. Therefore, the defendant is legally obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that when a jointly and severally liable guarantor (person C) acknowledges a claim from person A to person B before the prescription period has elapsed, the effect of interruption of prescription also affects the main obligor (person B). 

According to Article 152(1), if a right is acknowledged, a new period of prescription commences to run at the time of the acknowledgment. However, for this acknowledgment to affect the prescription period concerning other parties (like person B in this scenario), we must consider how these provisions interact with joint and several liability.

Article 441 suggests that circumstances affecting one joint and several obligor do not automatically affect others unless specified otherwise or if there's a manifestation of a different intention. However, Article 458 implies certain provisions apply to guarantors who are jointly and severally liable in a manner similar to the principal obligor, suggesting a closer link between their obligations and effects on prescription.

Given this context, the query seems to imply that an acknowledgment by a guarantor (person C) could indeed interrupt the prescription period for both the guarantor and the main obligor (person B), assuming such acknowledgment is considered a circumstance that can affect both parties under joint and several liability principles. Thus, based on logical reasoning and without explicit contrary evidence from the articles provided, we might lean towards considering this scenario as plausible or True.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning for all factors.

1. **If a right is acknowledged, a new period of prescription commences to run at the time of the acknowledgment.**  
   (query entails 1) - The query involves an acknowledgment by person C, which implies the commencement of a new prescription period as per Article 152(1).

2. **An acknowledgment of a right does not require unlimited capacity to act or authority with respect to the disposition of the right of the other party.**  
   (query entails 2) - The query doesn't explicitly address the capacity to act or authority required for the acknowledgment by person C, but it implies that such an acknowledgment is effective.

3. **The postponement of the expiry of prescription period or the renewal of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period or to renew prescription period have arisen and their successors.**  
   (query entails 3) - The query involves a scenario where an acknowledgment affects the prescription period, suggesting it considers the effectivity of such actions between relevant parties.

4. **The postponement of expiry of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period have arisen and their successors.**  
   (query entails 4) - Similar to factor 3, the query implies that the acknowledgment by person C affects the prescription period for both person B and potentially themselves.

5. **The renewal of prescription period under certain provisions is effective only between the parties with respect to whom grounds to renew prescription period have arisen and their successors.**  
   (query entails 5) - This factor aligns with the scenario where an acknowledgment leads to a new prescription period, affecting relevant parties.

6. **Certain provisions apply mutatis mutandis to circumstances which arise with regard to the guarantor that bears the obligation jointly and severally with the principal obligor.**  
   (query entails 6) - The query specifically involves a jointly and severally liable guarantor, implying these provisions are considered in their scenario.

7. **Any circumstances which have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors are not effective in relation to other joint and several obligors, except in certain cases.**  
   (query entails 7) - The query suggests an exception where an acknowledgment by one obligor (the guarantor) does affect another (the main obligor), fitting into "except in certain cases."

8. **If the obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors manifest a different intention, their intention prevails with respect to the effect in relation to the remaining other joint and several obligees.**  
   (query does not entail 8) - The query doesn't explicitly address the manifestation of a different intention by the parties involved.

Justifications for these factors generally support the logical reasoning outcome from Task 1, indicating that the query's scenario could indeed be considered as having an effect on both the guarantor and the main obligor regarding prescription interruption.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context of joint and several liability and the effect of acknowledgment on prescription periods, if person C (the guarantor) acknowledges the claim, it could imply that person B (the main obligor) is also affected in terms of their obligation to person A. However, this does not directly determine the defendant's obligation without considering the specifics of the case, such as whether person B was indeed liable for the debt or claim.

Thus, based on the information provided and focusing strictly on the query's implication regarding acknowledgment affecting prescription periods:

**pledged(1)**

This conclusion is reached under the assumption that the acknowledgment by the guarantor has a direct bearing on the obligations of all jointly and severally liable parties concerning the interruption of prescription periods.

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the agent made a manifestation of intention indicating that they would be making a manifestation of intention on behalf of the principal within the scope of the agent's authority. According to factor 1, this binds the principal directly, and therefore, the defendant (principal) is legally obligated.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the manifestation of intention was made within the scope of the agent's authority (factor 2), and a third party made a manifestation of intention to an agent, which applies mutatis mutandis according to factor 3. Since the manifestation is within the scope of authority and involves a third-party interaction with the agent, it can be inferred that the principal is bound by the agent's actions, making the defendant (principal) legally obligated.

(4 | N)
Justification: Here, only factor 4 applies, stating that a subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of their authority. However, without any indication that the subagent has made a manifestation of intention or acted in a way that would bind the principal (e.g., factors 1, 2, or 5), it cannot be concluded that the defendant (principal) is legally obligated solely based on the representation by the subagent.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this case, an agent made a manifestation of intention indicating they would act on behalf of the principal within their authority scope (factor 1), and there's also a subagent involved who has the same rights and obligations as an agent (factor 5). Given that both factors directly relate to binding manifestations of intent or actions taken by representatives of the principal, it can be concluded that the defendant (principal) is legally obligated due to these direct representations.

(2, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves a manifestation within the scope of the agent's authority (factor 2), a subagent representing the principal (factor 4), and this subagent having the same rights and obligations as an agent (factor 5). Since all these factors are about actions or representations made by agents or subagents within their scopes of authority, which directly affect the principal's obligations, it is reasonable to conclude that the defendant (principal) is legally obligated due to these comprehensive representative actions.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that a subagent's acts are equivalent to an agent's acts because he/she does not act in agency for the agent, but in agency for the principle, so it is sufficient if he/she indicates that his/her acts are made on behalf of the principle. According to Article 106(1), "A subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof." This means that when a subagent acts, they indeed act on behalf of the principal directly, not just the agent who appointed them. Therefore, logically, the query's assertion aligns with the principle outlined in Article 106(1), making it **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A manifestation of intention made by an agent indicating that they will be making a manifestation of intention on behalf of the principal within the scope of the agent's authority binds the principal directly.**
   - (query does not entail 1) The query discusses subagents acting on behalf of the principal, not agents making manifestations of intention about future actions.

2. **The manifestation of intention must be made within the scope of the agent's authority to bind the principal.**
   - (query does not entail 2) This factor is about the conditions under which an agent's manifestation binds the principal, which is not directly relevant to the query about subagents.

3. **The provisions of Article 99 apply mutatis mutandis to a manifestation of intention that a third party makes to an agent.**
   - (query does not entail 3) The query focuses on the actions and authority of subagents, not on manifestations made by third parties to agents.

4. **A subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of the authority thereof.**
   - (query entails 4) The query directly aligns with this factor, stating that a subagent's acts are equivalent to an agent's because they act on behalf of the principle.

5. **A subagent has the same rights and obligations as an agent in relation to the principal and third parties within the scope of that subagent's authority.**
   - (query entails 5) While not explicitly stated, the implication of the query is that since a subagent acts directly for the principal, they would have similar considerations regarding rights and obligations as an agent acting on behalf of the principal.

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is **True** based on logical reasoning related to the role and authority of subagents.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context, the query discusses the nature of a subagent's actions and their equivalence to an agent's actions in representing the principal. It does not explicitly mention any obligations of a defendant. Therefore, based on the information provided:

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the factors:

1. The obligor is liable to pay interest and expenses in addition to principal with respect to one or more obligations.
2. The obligor bears two or more obligations requiring the same kind of payment or delivery to the same obligee.
3. The person that performs the obligations makes payment or delivery which is not sufficient to extinguish the obligation in its entirety.
4. Payment or delivery must be appropriated first to expenses.
5. After expenses, payment or delivery must be appropriated to interest.
6. Finally, payment or delivery must be appropriated to principal.
7. The provisions of the preceding Article apply mutatis mutandis in cases where payment or delivery is not sufficient to extinguish any of expenses, interest, or principal in whole.

Number of factors : 7

Verdict: Payment or delivery that is not sufficient to extinguish the obligation in its entirety must be appropriated first to expenses, then to interest, and finally to principal.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the factors provided from Article 489, we'll create seven unique combinations where each combination includes a different subset of the factors. The goal is to determine whether the defendant is legally obligated ("pledged") in each scenario.

### Case Scenarios

1. **Scenario with Factor 1**
   (1 | Y)
   - Justification: The obligor being liable to pay interest and expenses in addition to principal already establishes a legal obligation towards the payment, indicating that the defendant is pledged to fulfill these obligations.

2. **Scenario with Factors 1 and 2**
   (1, 2 | Y)
   - Justification: When the obligor bears multiple obligations requiring the same kind of payment or delivery to the same obligee and is liable for interest and expenses, this compound scenario reinforces the legal obligation, as it specifies conditions under which payments must be prioritized.

3. **Scenario with Factor 3**
   (3 | N)
   - Justification: The mere fact that a payment or delivery is not sufficient to extinguish the obligation does not inherently obligate the defendant without considering the nature of the obligations themselves. Thus, this factor alone does not establish an obligation.

4. **Scenario with Factors 1 and 3**
   (1, 3 | Y)
   - Justification: Combining the liability for interest and expenses with insufficient payment or delivery to extinguish the obligation implies that the defendant has a legal duty to prioritize how these payments are applied, indicating an obligation.

5. **Scenario with Factors 2, 4, and 5**
   (2, 4, 5 | Y)
   - Justification: When multiple obligations of the same kind exist for the same obligee, and there's a requirement to appropriate payments first to expenses and then to interest, it suggests a structured approach to fulfilling obligations, thereby indicating that the defendant is legally obligated.

6. **Scenario with Factors 3, 6**
   (3, 6 | Y)
   - Justification: Although insufficient payment or delivery alone may not obligate the defendant, when combined with the requirement to appropriate payments finally to principal after other considerations, it implies a process of fulfilling obligations in a structured manner, suggesting an obligation.

7. **Scenario with Factor 7**
   (7 | N)
   - Justification: The applicability of provisions from a preceding article mutatis mutandis does not directly imply an obligation without considering the specifics of those provisions and how they apply to the case at hand. This factor alone suggests a procedural or interpretive guideline rather than establishing an obligation.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors that lead to a determinate verdict regarding whether the defendant is legally obligated. These scenarios cover various aspects of Article 489, from liability for payments to the appropriation of insufficient funds, and demonstrate how different combinations of factors can influence the legal outcome.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined:

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The article states that when an obligor has to pay interest and expenses in addition to principal for one or more obligations, and the payment or delivery made by the person performing the obligations is not enough to cover everything, it must be applied first to expenses, then to interest, and finally to principal. The query essentially restates this rule, specifying that if a performance (payment or delivery) is not sufficient to extinguish an obligation entirely, it should be allocated first to expenses, then to interest, and then to the principal in that order.

Given this, the query accurately reflects the content of Article 489 regarding how payments should be allocated when they are insufficient to cover all aspects of an obligation (expenses, interest, and principal). Therefore, based on logical reasoning, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The obligor is liable to pay interest and expenses in addition to principal with respect to one or more obligations.**
   - The query mentions paying "the principal as well as the applicable interest and expenses," which aligns with this factor. Therefore, (query entails 1).

2. **The obligor bears two or more obligations requiring the same kind of payment or delivery to the same obligee.**
   - This factor is not directly addressed in the query, as it focuses on the allocation of a single insufficient performance rather than comparing different obligations. Thus, (query does not entail 2).

3. **The person that performs the obligations makes payment or delivery which is not sufficient to extinguish the obligation in its entirety.**
   - The query specifies "if the person who must perform tenders any performance which is not sufficient to extinguish such obligation in its entirety," directly addressing this factor. Hence, (query entails 3).

4. **Payment or delivery must be appropriated first to expenses.**
   - The query states that such performance "shall be allocated first to the expense," aligning with this requirement. So, (query entails 4).

5. **After expenses, payment or delivery must be appropriated to interest.**
   - Following the allocation to expenses, the query indicates allocation "then to the interest," which matches this factor. Therefore, (query entails 5).

6. **Finally, payment or delivery must be appropriated to principal.**
   - The query concludes with "and then to the principal," reflecting this factor accurately. Thus, (query entails 6).

7. **The provisions of the preceding Article apply mutatis mutandis in cases where payment or delivery is not sufficient to extinguish any of expenses, interest, or principal in whole.**
   - This factor involves a reference to another article's provisions and their application, which is not directly mentioned in the query. Consequently, (query does not entail 7).

The justifications provided align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True regarding the allocation of insufficient payments.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the context and content of both the article and the query, they outline a procedure for allocating payments when an obligor's performance is insufficient to cover all obligations (expenses, interest, and principal). This implies a situation where there are obligations that need to be fulfilled, suggesting that if such a scenario arises, the defendant (obligor) would indeed have obligations to meet. Thus, in the context of having obligations that require payment or delivery, the query does determine the defendant obligated. Therefore, **pledged(1)**.

In summary:
- The query is True based on logical reasoning.
- The query entails factors 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 but does not entail factors 2 and 7.
- pledged(1) as the query implies the defendant has obligations.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided articles, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases, ensuring that each represents a factor used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the factors:

1. Statutory liens for the sale of movables exist against movables.
2. The statutory lien is in connection with the price of those movables.
3. The statutory lien is also in connection with interest on the price of those movables.
4. A statutory lien may be exercised against things including monies that the obligor is to receive.
5. The receipt of monies or other things by the obligor is as a result of the sale, lease or loss of, or damage to, the subject matter of the statutory lien.
6. The holder of the statutory lien must attach the monies or other thing before the payment or delivery.
7. The provisions regarding attachment also apply to consideration for real rights created by the obligor on the subject matter of the statutory lien.

Number of factors : 7 

Verdict: None (as there is no verdict sentence in the provided articles, only factors that determine the application and scope of statutory liens)
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 7 unique legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: The statutory lien for the sale of movables exists against movables, which means that the defendant is obligated to honor the lien.

(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: The statutory lien is in connection with both the price of the movables and interest on the same. Since both factors are present, it indicates a clear obligation on the part of the defendant to pay both the principal amount and the interest.

(4 | N)
Justification: A statutory lien may be exercised against things including monies that the obligor is to receive, but without any additional factors indicating a connection to the subject matter or attachment by the holder, it does not necessarily imply an obligation on the part of the defendant in this isolated context.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: The combination of statutory liens existing against movables and the obligor receiving monies as a result of the sale, lease, or loss of the subject matter suggests that the defendant has a source of funds (the received monies) directly related to the lien, thereby indicating an obligation.

(6 | N)
Justification: The requirement for the holder of the statutory lien to attach the monies or other things before payment or delivery does not in itself imply an obligation on the part of the defendant without any context of the lien's existence or its connection to the subject matter.

(2, 4, 7 | Y)
Justification: This combination includes the statutory lien being connected to the price of movables (factor 2), potentially extending to monies the obligor is to receive (factor 4), and applying to consideration for real rights created on the subject matter (factor 7). Together, these factors create a strong basis for concluding that the defendant is obligated, as they encompass both the primary obligation (price of movables) and potential future or derivative obligations.

(1, 3, 6 | Y)
Justification: The existence of statutory liens against movables (factor 1), their connection to both the price and interest on those movables (factor 3), and the requirement for attachment before payment or delivery (factor 6) collectively indicate a comprehensive framework for the lien's enforcement. This suggests that the defendant is indeed obligated, as all aspects of the lien's establishment, calculation, and enforcement are addressed.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determining the Query's Validity
Given the articles and the query, we must assess whether the statement "If the obligor sold the subject matter of a statutory lien to a third party, the holder of the statutory lien for sales of movables may exercise such right against the purchase money claim accrued from the sales" is True or False based on logical reasoning.

From Article 304(1), it's clear that a statutory lien can be exercised against monies (or other things) the obligor is to receive as a result of selling the subject matter of the statutory lien, provided the holder attaches these before payment or delivery. This aligns with the scenario in the query where the obligor sells the subject matter, and the buyer's purchase money could potentially be targeted by the statutory lien.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 304(1), the query is True.

### Task 2: Assessing Factor Expression
Next, we evaluate whether the query expresses each of the factors identified:

1. **Statutory liens for the sale of movables exist against movables**: The query implies this by discussing the holder of a statutory lien for sales of movables but doesn't directly state it. (query entails 1)
2. **The statutory lien is in connection with the price of those movables**: This factor is indirectly referenced through the concept of "purchase money claim," which relates to the sale price. (query entails 2)
3. **The statutory lien is also in connection with interest on the price of those movables**: The query does not mention interest, so it does not express this factor directly. 
4. **A statutory lien may be exercised against things including monies that the obligor is to receive**: The query expresses this by mentioning "purchase money claim accrued from the sales." (query entails 4)
5. **The receipt of monies or other things by the obligor is as a result of the sale, lease or loss of, or damage to, the subject matter of the statutory lien**: This factor is directly addressed in the query through the mention of selling the subject matter. (query entails 5)
6. **The holder of the statutory lien must attach the monies or other thing before the payment or delivery**: The query does not explicitly state this condition. 
7. **The provisions regarding attachment also apply to consideration for real rights created by the obligor on the subject matter of the statutory lien**: This factor is not directly addressed in the query.

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming that the query's scenario can indeed apply under the given articles, particularly Article 304(1).

### Task 3: Determining Obligation
The query does imply an obligation on the part of the defendant (or obligor) to have their purchase money claim potentially targeted by the statutory lien. Therefore, it suggests an obligation or a condition that could lead to such an outcome.

Given this, we represent the determination as pledged(1), indicating that the query implies the defendant is obligated in some manner related to the statutory lien's exercise against the sale proceeds.

In summary:
- The query is determined to be True based on logical reasoning.
- Justifications for factor expression are provided with entitlements where applicable.
- The obligation status is represented as pledged(1), indicating an implied obligation related to the statutory lien.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. The mandatary has expended costs.
2. The costs were found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business.
3. The mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator.
4. The claim includes any interest on the costs.
5. The interest is calculated from the day the costs were expended.

Verdict: The mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator and any interest on the same from the day the costs were expended.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of the factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: The mandatary has expended costs, but there is no information about whether these costs were necessary for the administration of the mandated business or if the mandatary may claim reimbursement. Without these essential elements, the defendant is not obligated to reimburse the mandatary.

(2 | N)
Justification: The costs were found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business, but there is no indication that the mandatary has actually expended these costs or intends to claim reimbursement. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated to take any action.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: Both factors are present, indicating that the mandatary has expended necessary costs for the administration of the mandated business. Although the article mentions claiming reimbursement and interest, the presence of these two critical factors establishes a basis for the mandatary's claim, suggesting the defendant is obligated to consider reimbursement.

(3 | Y)
Justification: The mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator, which directly implies an obligation on the part of the defendant to reimburse the mandatary. This factor alone is sufficient to establish the defendant's obligation because it explicitly states the mandatary's right to claim reimbursement.

(1, 2, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: With all these factors present, it is clear that the mandatary has expended necessary costs, may claim reimbursement, and is entitled to interest on those costs calculated from the day they were expended. The comprehensive nature of these factors leaves no doubt about the defendant's obligation to reimburse the mandatary, including the payment of interest.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors, leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation based on the article's requirements.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query "If the mandatary has expended costs found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business, the mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator and any interest on the same from the day the costs were expended" directly reflects the content of Article 650(1). This means that under the conditions stated (the mandatary expending necessary costs), the legal position regarding reimbursement as outlined in the article is correctly represented. Thus, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 650(1), the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The mandatary has expended costs.**
   - The query entails this factor because it explicitly mentions "the mandatary has expended costs," which directly aligns with the condition stated in the article.

2. **The costs were found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business.**
   - The query entails this factor as well since it specifies that the costs were "found to be necessary for the administration of the mandated business."

3. **The mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator.**
   - This factor is also entailed in the query, which states that "the mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator."

4. **The claim includes any interest on the costs.**
   - The query mentions "and any interest on the same," indicating that it does indeed include interest as part of the claim.

5. **The interest is calculated from the day the costs were expended.**
   - The query specifies "from the day the costs were expended" for calculating interest, aligning with this factor.

**Justification Alignment with Task 1 Result:**
Given that all factors are entailed in the query and it accurately represents the conditions and outcomes as stated in Article 650(1), our justification supports the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is **True**.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query outlines a condition under which "the mandatary may claim reimbursement of those costs from the mandator," implying an obligation on the part of the mandator to reimburse the mandatary if the specified conditions are met. Therefore, it does determine that the defendant (in this context, likely referring to the mandator) is obligated under certain circumstances.

Given this analysis, **pledged(1)** is the appropriate representation, as the query does imply an obligation on the part of the defendant (mandator) to reimburse costs and interest under the specified conditions.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To break down Article 117 (1) into its constituent factors for determining liability in cases involving agency contracts, we analyze it step by step:

1. A person concludes a contract as an agent of another person.
2. The person is liable to the counterparty.
3. Liability is for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage.
4. The counterparty has the choice between contract performance and compensation for loss or damage.
5. The agent's liability can be mitigated if the agent proves their authority to represent the principal.
6. Alternatively, the agent's liability can also be affected if the principal ratifies the contract.

Given these factors, we have a total of 6 key points that influence the outcome of cases under Article 117 (1).

<Number of factors : 6>

Verdict: A person who concludes a contract as an agent of another person is liable to the counterparty for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage, as chosen by the counterparty, unless the person proves the authority to represent or the principal ratifies the contract.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the factors provided from Article 117(1), we will create six unique cases, each assuming a different combination of the factors. The goal is to determine whether the defendant (the person acting as an agent) is legally obligated based on the occurrence of these factors.

### Case 1: Basic Agency Contract
(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the person concludes a contract as an agent of another person (Factor 1), and they are liable to the counterparty (Factor 2). Since these basic conditions for liability under Article 117(1) are met without any mitigating factors (such as proof of authority or ratification by the principal), the defendant is legally obligated.

### Case 2: Choice of Counterparty
(1, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: Here, the agent concludes a contract on behalf of another (Factor 1), is liable for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage (Factor 3), and the counterparty has the choice between these two options (Factor 4). Given that the core elements of liability and the counterparty's choice are present, and without evidence of authority to represent or ratification, the defendant remains obligated.

### Case 3: Mitigation by Proof of Authority
(1, 5 | N)
Justification: In this case, the agent acts on behalf of another (Factor 1) but proves their authority to represent the principal (Factor 5). According to Article 117(1), proving authority mitigates the agent's liability. Therefore, since the agent has demonstrated they were authorized, they are not legally obligated.

### Case 4: Principal's Ratification
(1, 6 | N)
Justification: The agent concludes a contract as an agent of another (Factor 1), and the principal ratifies the contract (Factor 6). Article 117(1) states that if the principal ratifies the contract, this affects the agent's liability. Ratification by the principal typically implies acceptance of the contract's terms and responsibilities, which would shift the focus from the agent's liability to the principal's. Thus, in this scenario, the defendant (agent) is not legally obligated.

### Case 5: Performance or Compensation without Choice
(2, 3 | Y)
Justification: Although this combination doesn't include the factor of the counterparty's choice (Factor 4), it does establish that the person is liable to the counterparty (Factor 2) for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage (Factor 3). Given these conditions, and in the absence of any mitigating factors like proof of authority or ratification, the defendant remains obligated.

### Case 6: Full Scenario with All Factors
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 | N)
Justification: This scenario includes all factors: the agent concludes a contract on behalf of another (Factor 1), is liable to the counterparty (Factor 2), liable for performance or compensation (Factor 3), the counterparty has a choice (Factor 4), the agent proves their authority (Factor 5), and the principal ratifies the contract (Factor 6). The presence of Factors 5 and 6 (proof of authority and principal's ratification) are crucial as they mitigate the agent's liability. Therefore, considering all aspects, the defendant is not legally obligated due to the mitigating factors.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that A, acting as the agent of B, concluded a contract with C for the sale of land owned by B without having the authority to do so. However, it mentions that if B ratifies the contract of sales, A is not liable to C as an unauthorized agency. According to Article 117 (1), if the principal (B) ratifies the contract, the agent's (A) liability can indeed be affected. Specifically, ratification by the principal can remove the agent's liability for acting without authority, as it implies the principal accepts the actions of the agent as their own. Therefore, based on the article, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **A person concludes a contract as an agent of another person.**
   - (query entails 1) The query directly mentions that A acts as the agent of B and concludes a contract with C, fulfilling this condition.

2. **The person is liable to the counterparty.**
   - This factor is partially considered in the query but with a specific condition (lack of authority). However, it does not directly state A's liability without the ratification. So, we can say it touches upon this aspect indirectly.

3. **Liability is for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage.**
   - The query does not explicitly mention liability for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage but focuses on the sale of land, implying a contractual obligation without detailing the nature of liability.

4. **The counterparty has the choice between contract performance and compensation for loss or damage.**
   - (query entails 4) The query does not explicitly address this choice being available to C, so it doesn't directly express this factor.

5. **The agent's liability can be mitigated if the agent proves their authority to represent the principal.**
   - While the query mentions A had no authority, it doesn't explore the scenario where A proves their authority; instead, it focuses on B's ratification as a means to affect A's liability.

6. **Alternatively, the agent's liability can also be affected if the principal ratifies the contract.**
   - (query entails 6) The query directly addresses this by stating that if B ratifies the contract, A is not liable, aligning with Article 117 (1).

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given that the query states a scenario where A's liability is removed due to B's ratification of the contract, it implies that in this specific case, A (the defendant) is **not** obligated. Therefore, the output for this task is:

pledged(0)

In summary:
- The query is True based on Article 117 (1).
- Justifications for factors show direct alignment with some aspects and indirect or partial consideration of others.
- The query determines the defendant (A) is not obligated due to the principal's ratification.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. The performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the contract.
2. The performance of an obligation is impossible in light of other sources of claims.
3. The performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the common sense in the transaction.
4. The obligee may not request the performance of the obligation if it is impossible.
5. The impossibility of the performance of an obligation is based on a contract as of the time of the formation of the contract.
6. Compensation for loss or damage that arises from the impossibility of the obligation may be claimed.
7. The provisions of Article 415 apply to claiming compensation for loss or damage.

Number of factors : 7

Verdict: The obligee may not request the performance of the obligation if it is impossible, but may claim compensation for loss or damage pursuant to the provisions of Article 415.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the factors outlined from Article 412-2, we'll create combinations of these factors to assess whether the defendant is legally obligated. Given there are 7 factors, we aim to create 7 unique case scenarios, each with a distinct combination of factors that leads to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation.

### Case Scenario 1:
(1, 2 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, the performance of an obligation is impossible both in light of the contract (factor 1) and other sources of claims (factor 2). However, since factor 4 states that the obligee may not request the performance of the obligation if it is impossible, and factors related to compensation (factors 6 and 7) are not considered here, the defendant is not obligated.

### Case Scenario 2:
(3 | N)
Justification: This case involves only the impossibility in light of the common sense in the transaction (factor 3). Without considering the contract or other sources of claims directly, and lacking any mention of compensation factors, the defendant cannot be deemed obligated solely based on common sense about the transaction's feasibility.

### Case Scenario 3:
(1, 4 | N)
Justification: Here, the performance is impossible in light of the contract (factor 1), and it's established that the obligee may not request performance if it's impossible (factor 4). Since factor 4 directly addresses the impossibility leading to no obligation for performance, and there's no mention of compensation being sought or applicable, the defendant is not obligated.

### Case Scenario 4:
(5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the impossibility is based on a contract as of the time of its formation (factor 5). This implies that the obligation was known to be impossible from the start. However, factor 2 of Article 412-2 suggests that despite such impossibility, compensation for loss or damage can be claimed under Article 415's provisions. Thus, considering the contractual basis and potential for claiming damages, the defendant could still be seen as legally obligated to address the impossibility through compensation.

### Case Scenario 5:
(6 | Y)
Justification: This case focuses on compensation for loss or damage arising from the impossibility of the obligation (factor 6). Since this factor directly pertains to seeking redress for an impossible obligation, it implies that there's a basis for claiming damages. Therefore, the defendant would be obligated to consider or provide such compensation.

### Case Scenario 6:
(2, 7 | Y)
Justification: Here, the performance is impossible in light of other sources of claims (factor 2), and the provisions of Article 415 apply for claiming compensation (factor 7). Given that factor 7 explicitly mentions a legal pathway (Article 415) for seeking compensation due to impossibility, this scenario clearly indicates that the defendant has an obligation to address the claimant's losses through the specified legal provisions.

### Case Scenario 7:
(1, 3, 5, 6, 7 | Y)
Justification: This comprehensive scenario combines several factors: impossibility in light of the contract (factor 1), common sense in the transaction (factor 3), contractual basis at formation (factor 5), potential for compensation (factor 6), and applicability of Article 415's provisions (factor 7). With such a broad basis covering both the impossibility aspects and the legal framework for seeking damages, it's clear that the defendant is obligated not only to acknowledge the impossibility but also to engage with the process of providing compensation as per the relevant legal provisions.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation, ensuring no two cases rely on the same set of factors.

### Task 1: Assessing the Query's Truth Value Based on Logical Reasoning

Given Article 412-2 and the query about a contract for sale that doesn't become effective because X is burned down the day before the conclusion of the contract, we must determine if this situation aligns with the article's stipulations regarding impossibility and its effects on contractual obligations.

The article states that if the performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the contract or other sources of claims and common sense in the transaction, the obligee may not request the performance of the obligation. However, it also allows for compensation claims due to such impossibility under Article 415.

If X being burned down directly affects the subject matter of the sale (e.g., X is the item to be sold or a crucial element for the contract's fulfillment), then the performance of the obligation becomes impossible. In this context, considering the common sense in transactions and the specifics of contracts, if a fundamental aspect of the agreement is destroyed before the contract can take effect, it stands to reason that the contract cannot proceed as initially intended.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning related to contractual obligations and the impossibility of performance due to unforeseen circumstances like destruction of key assets, the query's assertion about the contract not becoming effective seems plausible under certain interpretations, particularly if X's destruction directly impacts the contract's feasibility. Hence, we might lean towards considering the query as having a basis in the given legal framework.

### Task 2: Assessing Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the contract.**
   - (query entails 1) The destruction of X could indeed make the performance impossible if X was integral to the contract's purpose or subject matter.

2. **The performance of an obligation is impossible in light of other sources of claims.**
   - (query entails 2) If external factors like insurance claims or legal disputes arise due to X's destruction, these could further complicate and potentially make the contract's fulfillment impossible.

3. **The performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the common sense in the transaction.**
   - (query entails 3) Common sense would dictate that if a critical component of the sale (like the item being sold or its necessary infrastructure) is destroyed, expecting the contract to proceed as normal might not be reasonable.

4. **The obligee may not request the performance of the obligation if it is impossible.**
   - (query entails 4) This aligns with the scenario where X's destruction makes the contract unfulfillable; thus, the obligee cannot reasonably demand its execution.

5. **The impossibility of the performance of an obligation is based on a contract as of the time of the formation of the contract.**
   - (query does not directly entail 5) The query focuses on an event occurring before the contract's conclusion rather than at the time of formation, which might slightly differ in interpretation regarding when the impossibility becomes apparent.

6. **Compensation for loss or damage that arises from the impossibility of the obligation may be claimed.**
   - (query does not directly entail 6) While the query implies a situation where compensation might be relevant due to the destruction of X, it doesn't explicitly address claiming compensation as part of its assertion.

7. **The provisions of Article 415 apply to claiming compensation for loss or damage.**
   - (query does not directly entail 7) Similar to factor 6, while the scenario could potentially involve claims under Article 415, the query itself doesn't specify this aspect.

### Task 3: Determining Defendant Obligation

Given the information and focusing on whether the query implies the defendant is obligated or not:

- If we interpret the destruction of X as directly impacting the contract's feasibility and thus implying that contractual obligations cannot be fulfilled due to impossibility, then the defendant might not be obligated to proceed with the contract under normal circumstances. However, this doesn't necessarily absolve them of all responsibilities, such as potentially negotiating a new agreement or providing compensation.

Therefore, considering the specifics of legal obligations in contracts when faced with unforeseen destructive events:

- **pledged(0)**: The query suggests a scenario where contractual obligations might be impossible to fulfill due to external factors (destruction of X), implying that under certain conditions, the defendant might not be obligated to proceed as initially planned. However, this does not mean there are no obligations at all; it's about the specific performance of the contract as initially agreed upon.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 502 (1), I have broken down the text into key phrases or sentences that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the factors:

1. Performance by subrogation occurs with respect to one part of a claim.
2. The subrogee has the consent of the obligee.
3. The subrogee may exercise the rights of the subrogee together with the obligee.
4. The exercise of rights is in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance.

Number of factors : 4

Verdict: If the conditions are met, the subrogee, with the consent of the obligee, may exercise the rights of the subrogee together with the obligee in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 502 (1), I will generate 4 legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs, meaning performance by subrogation occurs with respect to one part of a claim. However, without the consent of the obligee (factor 2) and the exercise of rights together with the obligee (factor 3), the defendant is not obligated.

(2, 4 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2 and 4 occur, meaning the subrogee has the consent of the obligee and may exercise rights in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance. However, without performance by subrogation occurring with respect to one part of a claim (factor 1) and the exercise of rights together with the obligee (factor 3), the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 3 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 and 3 occur, meaning performance by subrogation occurs with respect to one part of a claim and the subrogee may exercise the rights of the subrogee together with the obligee. However, without the consent of the obligee (factor 2) and the exercise of rights in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance (factor 4), the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 2, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, all factors occur, meaning performance by subrogation occurs with respect to one part of a claim, the subrogee has the consent of the obligee, and the subrogee may exercise the rights of the subrogee together with the obligee in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

Note that each case yields a clear, determinate verdict based on the occurrence of the factors, and no two cases use the same combination of factors.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined, let's break down the process step by step.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states that a guarantor may independently exercise the secured claim and the security right acquired through subrogation in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance after partially paying a secured claim. According to Article 502 (1), for a subrogee to exercise rights together with the obligee, it must be in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance and with the consent of the obligee. The query does not explicitly mention obtaining consent from the obligee before exercising these rights independently. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and considering the conditions set forth in Article 502 (1), the query seems to misinterpret or overlook a crucial condition (obligee's consent) for exercising rights together with the obligee. Hence, the query is False.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **Performance by subrogation occurs with respect to one part of a claim.**
   - The query mentions partial payment of a secured claim, which aligns with performance by subrogation for one part of a claim. Therefore, (query entails 1).

2. **The subrogee has the consent of the obligee.**
   - The query does not mention obtaining consent from the obligee before exercising rights independently. Hence, it does not explicitly consider this factor, which is crucial according to Article 502 (1). Therefore, (query does not entail 2).

3. **The subrogee may exercise the rights of the subrogee together with the obligee.**
   - The query suggests independent exercise of the secured claim and security right by the guarantor, which deviates from exercising rights "together" with the obligee as stated in Article 502 (1). Therefore, (query does not entail 3).

4. **The exercise of rights is in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance.**
   - The query mentions exercising rights in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance, which aligns with this factor. Therefore, (query entails 4).

Justifications provided for each factor indicate that while the query addresses some aspects of Article 502 (1), such as partial performance and proportional exercise of rights, it fails to account for critical conditions like obtaining the obligee's consent and exercising rights together with the obligee. This aligns with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the inaccuracies in how the query interprets Article 502 (1), particularly regarding independent action without consent and not exercising rights together with the obligee, it does not accurately determine the defendant's obligations based on the article. Therefore, pledged(0). 

In summary:
- The query is False.
- (query entails 1)
- (query does not entail 2)
- (query does not entail 3)
- (query entails 4)
- pledged(0)

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. The borrower bears the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing.
2. The provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis to costs other than the ordinarily necessary expenses referred to in the preceding paragraph.
3. Ordinarily necessary expenses are borne by the borrower.
4. Costs other than ordinarily necessary expenses are subject to the provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2).
5. The borrower is responsible for expenses related to the borrowed thing that are considered ordinary and necessary.

Number of factors : 5

Verdict: The borrower is liable for the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing, while other costs are governed by the provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2).
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the borrower bears the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing, as stated in factor 1. This directly implies that the defendant (borrower) is legally obligated to cover these expenses.

(2 | N)
Justification: Factor 2 mentions that the provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis to costs other than the ordinarily necessary expenses. However, this factor alone does not establish a direct obligation for the defendant regarding the specific expenses in question. Therefore, without additional factors, the defendant is not obligated.

(3, 5 | Y)
Justification: Factors 3 and 5 both emphasize that the borrower is responsible for ordinary and necessary expenses related to the borrowed thing. The combination of these two factors reinforces the idea that the defendant has a clear obligation to cover these expenses, making them legally obligated.

(4 | N)
Justification: Factor 4 states that costs other than ordinarily necessary expenses are subject to the provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2). Similar to factor 2, this alone does not directly obligate the defendant without specifying the nature of those costs or how Article 583 applies. Thus, based solely on this factor, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 2, 4 | Y)
Justification: The combination of factors 1, 2, and 4 provides a comprehensive understanding of the defendant's obligations. Factor 1 establishes the borrower's responsibility for ordinary expenses, while factors 2 and 4 clarify how other costs are handled under Article 583, paragraph (2). This combination indicates that the defendant has specific obligations regarding both ordinary necessary expenses and other costs, as defined by the article and related provisions, making them legally obligated.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Assessing the Query Based on Logical Reasoning
The query states that if B (the borrower) has defrayed the ordinarily necessary expenses with respect to building X (the borrowed thing), B may demand the reimbursement of the necessary expenses from A (the lender). According to Article 595(1), "The borrower bears the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing." This implies that the borrower is responsible for these expenses, not the lender. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 595, the query is False because it suggests that B can demand reimbursement from A for expenses that B is supposed to bear.

### Task 2: Assessing Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor
1. **The borrower bears the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing.**  
   The query does not express this factor accurately in the context of who bears the costs; it implies a reversal where the borrower seeks reimbursement from the lender for these expenses, which contradicts the principle.

2. **The provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis to costs other than the ordinarily necessary expenses referred to in the preceding paragraph.**  
   The query does not express this factor as it specifically talks about "ordinarily necessary expenses" without referencing how other costs are handled according to Article 583.

3. **Ordinarily necessary expenses are borne by the borrower.**  
   The query contradicts this factor by suggesting that the borrower can demand reimbursement for these expenses from the lender.

4. **Costs other than ordinarily necessary expenses are subject to the provisions of Article 583, paragraph (2).**  
   This factor is not expressed in the query as it focuses solely on "ordinarily necessary expenses" without discussing other types of costs or how they are handled under different provisions.

5. **The borrower is responsible for expenses related to the borrowed thing that are considered ordinary and necessary.**  
   The query does not express this factor accurately; instead, it implies the lender is responsible for reimbursing these expenses, contrary to what is stated in Article 595.

Given these assessments:
- (query entails 1) is False because it misrepresents who bears the costs.
- (query entails 2) is False as it does not mention the application of Article 583(2).
- (query entails 3) is False since it suggests reimbursement for expenses the borrower should bear.
- (query entails 4) is False as it doesn't discuss other types of costs or their provisions.
- (query entails 5) is False because it incorrectly assigns responsibility for these expenses.

These justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False based on logical reasoning.

### Task 3: Determining Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated
The query does not accurately determine the defendant's obligations according to Article 595. In fact, by suggesting that B can demand reimbursement for ordinarily necessary expenses from A, it misinterprets the responsibility as defined by the article. Therefore, the defendant (in this context, presumably A, the lender) is not correctly obligated according to the query's scenario.

Thus, pledged(0).

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases, representing each factor used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. A registered lease may be duly asserted against mortgagees that hold mortgages registered prior to the registration of that lease.
2. The assertion of a registered lease against mortgagees requires the consent of all mortgagees that hold mortgages registered prior to the registration of that lease.
3. The consents of mortgagees must be registered for a registered lease to be duly asserted against them.
4. For a mortgagee to give consent, the approval of persons that hold rights for which the mortgage is the subject matter must be obtained.
5. The approval of other persons that will suffer detriment as a result of the consent of the mortgagee must also be obtained.

Number of factors : 5

Verdict: A registered lease may be duly asserted against mortgagees if all required consents are obtained and registered.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: Factor 1 alone does not provide sufficient grounds for the defendant to be obligated, as it only states a possibility without specifying the necessary conditions.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Although factors 2 and 3 are present, which require the consent of all mortgagees and registration of those consents, respectively, they do not guarantee that the required approvals from persons holding rights for which the mortgage is the subject matter have been obtained. Therefore, the defendant cannot be considered obligated.

(4 | N)
Justification: Factor 4 requires the approval of persons holding rights for which the mortgage is the subject matter, but it does not address the need for consent from all mortgagees or registration of those consents. As a result, this single factor is insufficient to determine that the defendant is obligated.

(1, 2, 4 | N)
Justification: Factors 1, 2, and 4 are present, which cover the possibility of asserting a registered lease against mortgagees, the requirement for consent from all mortgagees, and the need for approval from persons holding rights for which the mortgage is the subject matter. However, factor 3 (registration of consents) and factor 5 (approval from other persons who will suffer detriment) are missing, making it impossible to conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | Y)
Justification: All factors are present in this case. The registered lease may be asserted against mortgagees (factor 1), all required consents have been obtained from mortgagees (factor 2), those consents have been registered (factor 3), and the necessary approvals have been obtained from persons holding rights for which the mortgage is the subject matter (factor 4) as well as other persons who will suffer detriment (factor 5). Therefore, it can be concluded that the defendant is indeed obligated.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False Based on Logical Reasoning

The query states: "A registered lease may be asserted against the mortgagee who gave consent to the lease, if the entire mortgagee who had registered their respective mortgage before the lease's registration gave consent to the lease."

Given Article 387, a registered lease can indeed be duly asserted against mortgagees who hold mortgages registered prior to the lease's registration, provided all such mortgagees give their consent and these consents are registered. The query seems to align with this principle by stating that if all mortgagees who had registered their mortgages before the lease gave consent, then the lease may be asserted against them. However, it specifically mentions "the mortgagee who gave consent," which could imply a focus on individual consent rather than collective consent from all prior mortgagees.

The article requires consent from all mortgagees with prior registrations and also requires these consents to be registered. The query simplifies this by implying that if all prior mortgagees consent, the lease can be asserted against them without explicitly mentioning the registration of consents. Despite this, the essence of requiring collective consent is preserved in the query.

Therefore, based on logical reasoning and considering the requirements outlined in Article 387, the query appears to be **True** because it aligns with the principle that a registered lease can be asserted against mortgagees if they all give their consent.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. A registered lease may be duly asserted against mortgagees that hold mortgages registered prior to the registration of that lease.
   - (query entails 1) The query implies this condition by stating the lease can be asserted if all prior mortgagees give consent.

2. The assertion of a registered lease against mortgagees requires the consent of all mortgagees that hold mortgages registered prior to the registration of that lease.
   - (query entails 2) The query directly mentions the requirement for all prior mortgagees to give their consent.

3. The consents of mortgagees must be registered for a registered lease to be duly asserted against them.
   - The query does not explicitly mention the registration of consents, so it does not fully entail this factor.

4. For a mortgagee to give consent, the approval of persons that hold rights for which the mortgage is the subject matter must be obtained.
   - The query does not mention obtaining approvals from persons holding rights related to the mortgage, so it does not entail this factor.

5. The approval of other persons that will suffer detriment as a result of the consent of the mortgagee must also be obtained.
   - Similar to factor 4, the query does not address the need for approval from persons who might suffer detriment due to the mortgagee's consent, so it does not entail this factor.

Justifications align with Task 1 in that the core requirement of collective consent is preserved, supporting the query being considered true within the context provided. However, the query lacks detail regarding the registration of consents and approvals from affected parties.

### Task 3: Determine Whether the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated

Given the information and analysis, the query suggests conditions under which a registered lease can be asserted against mortgagees but does not directly address obligations of a defendant in a manner that implies an obligation to act or comply with the conditions for asserting the lease. Thus, it seems more about the conditions for asserting a lease rather than imposing an obligation on a defendant.

Therefore, **pledged(0)**, as the query does not explicitly determine the defendant obligated based on the information provided and the analysis conducted.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the factors:

1. The validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it does so while knowing that it does not reflect that person's true intention.
2. The person making the manifestation knows that it does not reflect their true intention.
3. The other party knew or could have known that the manifestation was not the true intention of the person who made it.
4. The manifestation of intention is void if the other party knew or could have known that it was not the true intention of the person who made it.
5. The nullity of a manifestation of intention may occur under certain circumstances.
6. A third party in good faith is involved in the case.
7. The nullity of a manifestation of intention under the provisions of the proviso to the preceding paragraph may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith.

Number of factors : 7

Verdict: The manifestation of intention is void if the other party knew or could have known that it was not the true intention of the person who made it, but the nullity of a manifestation of intention may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 93, I will generate 7 unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | N)
In this case, only factor 1 occurs: "The validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it does so while knowing that it does not reflect that person's true intention." Since the article states that the validity is not impaired, the defendant is not obligated solely based on this factor.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
Here, factors 2 and 3 are present: "The person making the manifestation knows that it does not reflect their true intention" and "The other party knew or could have known that the manifestation was not the true intention of the person who made it." Given that both parties are aware of the discrepancy between the manifested intention and the true intention, the defendant can be considered obligated due to the other party's knowledge.

3. (4 | Y)
In this scenario, only factor 4 occurs: "The manifestation of intention is void if the other party knew or could have known that it was not the true intention of the person who made it." Since the manifestation is void under these conditions, and assuming the other party had such knowledge, the defendant would be obligated as the basis for their obligation (the manifestation) is deemed void.

4. (1, 5 | N)
This case involves factors 1 and 5: "The validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it does so while knowing that it does not reflect that person's true intention" and "The nullity of a manifestation of intention may occur under certain circumstances." Given that the validity is generally not impaired by knowledge of false intention, and acknowledging the possibility of nullity under specific conditions (which are not further detailed here), the defendant is not obligated solely based on these factors.

5. (6 | N)
Here, only factor 6 is present: "A third party in good faith is involved in the case." The involvement of a third party in good faith does not inherently obligate the defendant without additional context regarding their actions or knowledge related to the manifestation of intention.

6. (2, 7 | N)
In this scenario, factors 2 and 7 are considered: "The person making the manifestation knows that it does not reflect their true intention" and "The nullity of a manifestation of intention under the provisions of the proviso to the preceding paragraph may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith." Since factor 7 protects third parties in good faith from assertions of nullity, and assuming such a third party is involved, the defendant cannot be obligated based on the nullity assertion being invalid against a third party.

7. (3, 4, 6 | Y)
This case combines factors 3, 4, and 6: "The other party knew or could have known that the manifestation was not the true intention of the person who made it," "The manifestation of intention is void if the other party knew or could have known that it was not the true intention of the person who made it," and "A third party in good faith is involved in the case." Although factor 6 introduces a third party in good faith, factors 3 and 4 establish that the manifestation is void due to the other party's knowledge. However, since the presence of a third party in good faith (factor 6) does not negate the voidness established by factors 3 and 4 but rather affects assertions of nullity against them, the defendant can still be considered obligated based on the void manifestation, considering the specific conditions around the third party's involvement are not detailed enough to override the effect of factors 3 and 4.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address this problem, we'll break it down into the three tasks as defined.

### Task 1: Determine if the Query is True or False
The query states that if a manifestation of intention is held void because it doesn't reflect the person's true intention, such nullity may be duly asserted against a third party in good faith acting with negligence. However, according to Article 93(2), "The nullity of a manifestation of intention under the provisions of the proviso to the preceding paragraph may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith." This directly contradicts the query since it doesn't specify that the third party must be acting with negligence to be exempt from the assertion of nullity. Therefore, based on the information provided, the query is False.

### Task 2: Assess Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor
1. **The validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it does so while knowing that it does not reflect that person's true intention.**
   - The query does not directly address this factor but focuses on the nullity aspect, not the initial validity.
   - (query entails 1) is False because it doesn't consider the scenario where validity isn't impaired.

2. **The person making the manifestation knows that it does not reflect their true intention.**
   - The query implies a situation where the manifestation is held void, possibly due to not reflecting true intentions, but doesn't directly address the maker's knowledge.
   - (query entails 2) is False because it doesn't explicitly consider the maker's awareness of their false intention.

3. **The other party knew or could have known that the manifestation was not the true intention of the person who made it.**
   - The query mentions a scenario where nullity might be asserted, which indirectly relates to this factor but does not directly address the other party's knowledge.
   - (query entails 3) is False because it doesn't explicitly consider the other party's awareness.

4. **The manifestation of intention is void if the other party knew or could have known that it was not the true intention of the person who made it.**
   - The query touches on a similar scenario where nullity (voidness) is considered, implying a situation where the manifestation might be void.
   - (query entails 4) is True because it considers a scenario where the manifestation's voidness is relevant.

5. **The nullity of a manifestation of intention may occur under certain circumstances.**
   - The query directly addresses a circumstance where nullity might be asserted, aligning with this factor.
   - (query entails 5) is True because it discusses a specific circumstance of nullity.

6. **A third party in good faith is involved in the case.**
   - The query mentions a "third party in good faith acting with negligence," which includes the aspect of being in good faith but adds an additional characteristic (negligence).
   - (query entails 6) is True because it involves a third party in good faith.

7. **The nullity of a manifestation of intention under the provisions of the proviso to the preceding paragraph may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith.**
   - The query contradicts this by suggesting that such nullity may indeed be asserted against a third party in good faith, albeit with an added condition (acting with negligence).
   - (query entails 7) is False because it directly opposes the statement.

### Task 3: Determine if the Query Determines the Defendant Obligated
The query discusses the assertion of nullity against a third party under specific conditions but does not explicitly state that the defendant is obligated. The focus is on whether nullity can be asserted, not on creating an obligation for the defendant.
- pledged(0)

In summary:
- Task 1: The query is False based on logical reasoning from the provided article.
- Task 2: Justifications for each factor with True/False assessments provided in the format (query entails X).
- Task 3: pledged(0) as the query does not determine the defendant obligated.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading Article 661, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying this article. Here are the results:

1. The bailor must compensate the bailee for damage that occurs due to the nature of or defects in the bailed things.
2. The bailor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect.
3. The bailee knew of the same nature or defect.

These factors will be used to determine the verdict in cases applying Article 661.

<Number of factors : 3>

Verdict: The bailor must compensate the bailee for damage that occurs due to the nature of or defects in the bailed things, provided that this does not apply if the bailor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect, or the bailee knew of the same.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on Article 661 and its factors, I will generate three legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the bailor must compensate the bailee for damage that occurs due to the nature of or defects in the bailed things (Factor 1). Since this is the only factor present, the defendant (bailor) is legally obligated to compensate the bailee.

(2 | N)
Justification: In this case, the bailor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect (Factor 2). According to Article 661, if the bailor did not know of the nature or defect without being negligent, they are not liable for compensation. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(1, 3 | N)
Justification: In this case, the bailor must compensate the bailee for damage that occurs due to the nature of or defects in the bailed things (Factor 1), but the bailee knew of the same nature or defect (Factor 3). According to Article 661, if the bailee knew of the nature or defect, the bailor is not liable for compensation. Therefore, despite Factor 1 being present, the defendant is not obligated due to the presence of Factor 3.

Note that I have ensured that no two cases use the same combination of factors and each case yields a clear, determinate verdict.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "The depositor, regardless of making payment or not, must compensate the depositary for damages that occur due to the nature of or defects in the Thing deposited except when the depositor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect, or the depositary knew of the same." This statement closely mirrors Article 661, which discusses the bailor's responsibility to compensate the bailee under similar conditions. The primary difference is the use of "depositor" and "depositary" instead of "bailor" and "bailee," but the context and conditions for compensation are essentially identical.

Given that the query aligns with the principles outlined in Article 661, considering the nature or defects of the bailed (or deposited) item and the knowledge or negligence of the parties involved, it can be logically concluded that the query is **True** based on the article's provisions.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The bailor must compensate the bailee for damage that occurs due to the nature of or defects in the bailed things.**
   - The query expresses this factor by stating the depositor must compensate the depositary for damages due to the nature of or defects in the thing deposited, which is essentially the same scenario with different terminology.

   (query entails 1)

2. **The bailor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect.**
   - The query considers this factor by including an exception when "the depositor did not, without negligence, know of such nature or defect," directly aligning with the article's condition.

   (query entails 2)

3. **The bailee knew of the same nature or defect.**
   - This factor is also expressed in the query as it mentions an exception when "the depositary knew of the same," mirroring the article's provision regarding the bailee's knowledge.

   (query entails 3)

All justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True, as it accurately reflects the conditions and exceptions outlined in Article 661.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given that the query outlines specific conditions under which the depositor must compensate the depositary, it implies an obligation on the part of the depositor (defendant) to provide compensation under certain circumstances. Therefore, the query does determine the defendant to be obligated under the conditions described.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To break down Article 552 into its core components for legal analysis:

1. A gift that is to be delivered periodically - This phrase establishes the type of gift being referred to in the article, specifically those that are not given all at once but rather over time.
2. Ceases to be effective - This indicates the outcome or status change of the gift under certain conditions.
3. On the death of the donor - This specifies one condition under which the gift ceases to be effective, namely the death of the person giving the gift.
4. Or the donee - This introduces an alternative condition, indicating that the cessation of the gift's effectiveness can also occur due to the death of the recipient.

Given these breakdowns, we are analyzing conditions related to the validity and continuation of periodic gifts based on the survival of the parties involved.

Number of factors : 4

Verdict: A gift that is to be delivered periodically ceases to be effective on the death of the donor or the donee.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 552, I will generate four legal case scenarios, each assuming a unique subset of these factors occurred. Here are the cases:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only the factor "A gift that is to be delivered periodically" is considered. Since there's no mention of the death of either the donor or the donee, the gift does not cease to be effective based solely on its periodic nature. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(2 | N)
Justification: This case considers only the factor "Ceases to be effective." Without any condition triggering this cessation (like the death of the donor or donee), we cannot conclude that the gift's effectiveness has ended. Thus, the defendant remains not obligated.

(3 | Y)
Justification: Here, we consider the factor "On the death of the donor." According to Article 552, if the donor dies, the periodic gift ceases to be effective. Therefore, in this scenario, the defendant would be obligated to recognize the cessation of the gift due to the donor's death.

(2, 4 | Y)
Justification: In this case, we have "Ceases to be effective" and "Or the donee." The occurrence of the donee's death is a condition that triggers the cessation of the periodic gift's effectiveness, as stated in Article 552. Thus, the defendant is obligated to acknowledge the end of the gift due to the donee's death.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation based on Article 552.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks defined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that "Periodic gifts shall lose its effect on the death of the donee, but they shall not lose its effect even if the donor dies." However, according to Article 552, a gift that is to be delivered periodically ceases to be effective on the death of either the donor or the donee. This means the query's assertion that periodic gifts do not lose their effect if the donor dies contradicts the article. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 552, the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor.

Given factors:
1. A gift that is to be delivered periodically
2. Ceases to be effective
3. On the death of the donor
4. Or the donee

The query mentions "Periodic gifts," which aligns with factor 1 (A gift that is to be delivered periodically). It also talks about losing effect, which corresponds to factor 2 (Ceases to be effective). However, it inaccurately represents the conditions under which the gift ceases to be effective, specifically concerning factors 3 and 4. The query correctly notes that the gift loses its effect on the death of the donee (factor 4) but incorrectly states that it does not lose its effect if the donor dies (factor 3).

- Query entails factor 1: Yes, because it mentions "Periodic gifts."
- Query entails factor 2: Yes, as it discusses the gift losing its effect.
- Query entails factor 3: No, because it inaccurately suggests the gift remains effective upon the donor's death.
- Query entails factor 4: Yes, since it correctly states the gift loses its effect on the donee's death.

These justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False, as it misrepresents one of the critical conditions (factor 3) outlined in Article 552.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

The query does not explicitly mention any obligations of a defendant. It discusses the effect of death on periodic gifts without referencing any legal obligations or responsibilities that could be attributed to a defendant in a legal context. Therefore, based on the information provided and the nature of the query, it does not determine the defendant's obligations. Hence, **pledged(0)**.

In summary:
- The query is False.
- (query entails factor 1), (query entails factor 2), (query entails factor 4) but does not entail factor 3.
- pledged(0)

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the factors:

1. An act that has been rescinded is deemed void ab initio.
2. A person that has received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void act has an obligation to restore the other party to the original state.
3. The obligation to restore applies to a person who has received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void act.
4. A person who has no mental capacity at the time of performing an act has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched by the act.
5. A person with qualified legal capacity at the time of performing an act also has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched by the act.

Number of factors : 5

Verdict: None (as there is no verdict sentence provided in the article)
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: Since an act that has been rescinded is deemed void ab initio, the defendant is obligated to take action as a result of this void act.

(2 | Y)
Justification: The factor clearly states that a person who has received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void act has an obligation to restore the other party to the original state. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

(3, 1 | Y)
Justification: Combining factors 3 and 1, we see that the obligation to restore applies to a person who has received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void act, which is deemed void ab initio. As a result, the defendant is obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: A person with no mental capacity at the time of performing an act still has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched by the act. Thus, the defendant is obligated.

(2, 5 | Y)
Justification: When combining factors 2 and 5, we find that a person who has received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void act must restore the other party to the original state. Additionally, having qualified legal capacity at the time of performing the act does not exempt the defendant from returning to the extent currently enriched by the act. Therefore, the defendant is obligated.

Note that each case presents a unique combination of factors, and all yield a determinate verdict of "Y" (Yes), indicating that the defendant is legally obligated in each scenario.

model to generate first structure: llama3.3
======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

Given the information in Article 121-2, specifically paragraph (3), a person who has no mental capacity at the time of performing an act has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched by the act. This principle also applies to a person with qualified legal capacity at the time of performing the act. The query mentions A, a person under curatorship (implying limited or no mental capacity for certain legal decisions), who has received a loan that is then cancelled. According to the article, if A spent the loan money (e.g., on gambling), they would still be obligated to return it but only to the extent they are currently enriched by the act.

However, the query states that A has the obligation to return the entire amount of the loan, even if it has been spent. This does not align with the article's provision for individuals without full mental capacity or qualified legal capacity, which suggests return only to the extent currently enriched. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the specifics provided in the article, the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. An act that has been rescinded is deemed void ab initio.
   - (query entails 1) The query implies this by stating a loan made by A is cancelled, suggesting it's deemed void from the start.

2. A person that has received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void act has an obligation to restore the other party to the original state.
   - (query entails 2) The query talks about returning the loan, indicating restoration after the act is deemed void.

3. The obligation to restore applies to a person who has received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void act.
   - (query entails 3) Similar to factor 2, the query implies A's obligation to return the loan after it's cancelled.

4. A person who has no mental capacity at the time of performing an act has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched by the act.
   - The query does not accurately reflect this principle because it suggests returning the entire amount regardless of current enrichment, so (query does not entail 4).

5. A person with qualified legal capacity at the time of performing an act also has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched by the act.
   - Similar to factor 4, the query inaccurately reflects this principle for someone under curatorship, implying full return regardless of current enrichment, so (query does not entail 5).

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given that A is under curatorship and received a loan that was later cancelled, according to Article 121-2(3), A would indeed have an obligation but specifically to return to the extent currently enriched by the act. However, since the query inaccurately suggests A must return the entire amount regardless of current enrichment, it misrepresents the specific obligation as outlined in the article.

Therefore, while the defendant (A) is obligated to some degree based on the principle that they should return what they can to the extent currently enriched, the query's statement about returning the "entire amount" does not accurately capture this nuanced obligation. Thus, **pledged(1)** because A has an obligation, but it's misunderstood in the context of the query.

**Summary:**

- Task 1: Query is **False**.
- Task 2:
  - (query entails 1)
  - (query entails 2)
  - (query entails 3)
  - (query does not entail 4)
  - (query does not entail 5)
- Task 3: **pledged(1)**, though with the clarification that the obligation is to return what they can based on current enrichment.

2. The lease must be registered to be duly asserted against mortgagees.

Number of factors : 7

Verdict: A registered lease may be duly asserted against mortgagees if all conditions, including registered consent and approvals, are met.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the factors provided from Article 387, we will create combinations of these factors to determine the legal obligation of the defendant in each scenario. Given there are 7 factors, we aim to create 7 distinct cases where each case involves a unique combination of factors.

### Case 1: Registered Lease Against Prior Mortgages
(1, 2, 3 | N)
- Justification: Even though the lease is registered (Factor 2) and can be asserted against mortgagees with prior registrations (Factors 1 and 3), without the consent of all mortgagees (Factor 4) and the registration of those consents (Factor 5), the defendant cannot be considered legally obligated.

### Case 2: Consent Without Registration
(4, 6, 7 | N)
- Justification: This case involves the consent of all mortgagees (Factor 4) and the necessary approvals from persons with rights in the mortgage and those who would suffer detriment (Factors 6 and 7). However, without a registered lease (Factor 2) or the registration of consents (Factor 5), the defendant is not legally obligated.

### Case 3: Registered Lease with Some Consents
(1, 2, 4 | N)
- Justification: Here, we have a registered lease (Factors 1 and 2) that can be asserted against prior mortgages, and all mortgagees give their consent (Factor 4). Yet, without the registration of these consents (Factor 5) or the approvals from relevant parties (Factors 6 and 7), the defendant is not obligated.

### Case 4: Prior Mortgages with Approved Consents
(3, 6, 7 | N)
- Justification: In this scenario, mortgagees hold mortgages prior to the lease registration (Factor 3), and there are approvals from persons with rights in the mortgage and those who would suffer detriment (Factors 6 and 7). However, without a registered lease (Factor 2) or the consent and registration of consents from all mortgagees (Factors 4 and 5), the defendant is not legally obligated.

### Case 5: Registered Lease Against Prior Mortgages with Consent Registration
(1, 2, 3, 5 | Y)
- Justification: This case includes a registered lease (Factors 1 and 2) that can be asserted against mortgagees with prior registrations (Factor 3), and the consents of these mortgagees are registered (Factor 5). Although it lacks explicit mention of obtaining all necessary consents (Factor 4) and approvals (Factors 6 and 7), given the comprehensive nature of the registration and assertion criteria, one might argue the defendant is obligated due to the fulfillment of key registration and prior mortgage conditions.

### Case 6: Complete Consents Without Lease Registration
(4, 5, 6, 7 | N)
- Justification: Here, all conditions for consent are met, including the registration of consents (Factors 4 and 5) and approvals from relevant parties (Factors 6 and 7). However, without a registered lease (Factor 2), the defendant cannot be considered legally obligated.

### Case 7: Full Compliance
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 | Y)
- Justification: This scenario includes all factors: a registered lease (Factors 1 and 2) asserted against prior mortgages (Factor 3), with the consent of all mortgagees (Factor 4), registration of these consents (Factor 5), and necessary approvals from persons with rights in the mortgage and those who would suffer detriment (Factors 6 and 7). With full compliance, the defendant is clearly legally obligated.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors to determine the legal obligation of the defendant based on Article 387.

======= Query Entaiments:
 **Task 1: Determining the Truth of the Query**

Based on the provided article and factors, we analyze the query: "If a lease of a building has been perfected by delivery, and all the holders of the mortgage registered on the building prior to such delivery have consented to the lease, the lessee may assert the creation of the right of lease against those who have purchased such building by enforcement of the mortgage."

The article states that a registered lease can be asserted against mortgagees if they give their consent and these consents are registered. However, it does not explicitly mention perfection by delivery as a condition for asserting the lease against subsequent purchasers through mortgage enforcement. Nonetheless, given that all holders of prior mortgages have consented and considering the principle of perfection of leases, it can be inferred that the query aligns with the general intent of protecting lessees' rights when there is clear evidence of consent from prior mortgagees.

Thus, based on logical reasoning and the information provided, we conclude that the query is **True**.


**Task 2: Assessing Query Against Factors**

1. A registered lease may be duly asserted against mortgagees that hold mortgages registered prior to the registration of that lease.
   - (query entails 1) because it discusses asserting a lease against those who purchased the building through enforcement of a mortgage, implying assertion against prior mortgagees.

2. The lease must be registered to be duly asserted against mortgagees.
   - The query does not directly mention registration but focuses on perfection by delivery and consent from mortgage holders. Thus, (query does not entail 2).

3. Mortgagees must hold mortgages registered prior to the registration of the lease.
   - (query entails 3) as it mentions all holders of the mortgage registered on the building prior to delivery have consented.

4. All mortgagees that hold those mortgages must give their consent for the lease to be duly asserted.
   - (query entails 4) since it states that all holders of the mortgage have consented to the lease.

5. The consents of the mortgagees must be registered.
   - Similar to factor 2, the query does not explicitly mention registration of consents but implies necessary conditions for assertion are met through consent and delivery. Thus, (query does not entail 5).

6. For a mortgagee to give consent, the approval of persons that hold rights for which the mortgage is the subject matter must be obtained.
   - The query does not specify obtaining approvals from persons holding rights related to the mortgage, so (query does not entail 6).

7. The approval of other persons that will suffer detriment as a result of the consent of the mortgagee must also be obtained.
   - Like factor 6, the query does not address this aspect directly, leading to (query does not entail 7).

Our justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1, considering the query's scenario and the general principles outlined in the article.


**Task 3: Determining Obligation**

The query discusses a scenario where conditions are met for the lessee to assert their rights against those who have purchased the building through mortgage enforcement. It does not directly imply that the defendant is obligated to take a specific action but outlines a condition under which the lessee's rights can be asserted.

Given this, it seems the query more describes a right or condition rather than imposing an obligation on a defendant. Therefore, **pledged(0)**.


In summary:
- The query is determined to be True based on logical reasoning.
- Justifications for each factor against the query have been provided in the required format.
- The determination of obligation results in pledged(0).

3. The other party knew or could have known that the manifestation was not the true intention of the person who made it.
4. The manifestation of intention is void if the other party knew or could have known that it was not the true intention of the person who made it.
5. The nullity of a manifestation of intention under certain provisions may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith.
6. A third party must be in good faith to be protected from the assertion of nullity.

Verdict: The validity of a manifestation of intention is impaired if the other party knew or could have known that it was not the true intention, but this impairment may not be asserted against a third party in good faith.

Number of factors : 6
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate six legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, the validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it does so while knowing that it does not reflect that person's true intention. Since this factor alone does not necessarily imply any wrongdoing or intent to deceive, the defendant can still be considered legally obligated as their manifestation of intention was made.

(2 | N)
Justification: If the only factor present is that the person making the manifestation knows that it does not reflect their true intention, but there's no indication that this was communicated or apparent to others, then the defendant's knowledge alone doesn't automatically invalidate their obligation. However, considering this in isolation might suggest an intent to deceive, which could morally but not legally obligate them differently. Thus, strictly under legal terms provided, without other factors indicating deception was known to others, we cannot definitively say they are obligated based solely on their internal knowledge.

(3 | Y)
Justification: If the other party knew or could have known that the manifestation was not the true intention of the person who made it, this implies a level of awareness or negligence on the part of the other party. The defendant's obligation might still be considered valid because the other party had or should have had knowledge of the discrepancy.

(4 | N)
Justification: In this case, if the manifestation of intention is void because the other party knew or could have known it was not the true intention, then logically, the defendant cannot be legally obligated by a void agreement. The basis for the obligation is nullified due to the other party's knowledge or potential knowledge.

(5 | Y)
Justification: This scenario involves a third party in good faith. Even if the nullity of a manifestation of intention under certain provisions may not be duly asserted against this third party, it doesn't necessarily absolve the defendant from their obligations towards the original parties involved. The protection afforded to third parties does not directly impact the defendant's legal obligation unless they are directly claiming rights through or against this third party.

(6 | Y)
Justification: If a third party must be in good faith to be protected from the assertion of nullity, and we assume such good faith exists, then similar to case 5, this does not inherently release the defendant from their obligations. The focus here is on the protection of the third party rather than the obligations between the original parties.

Each scenario provides a distinct combination of factors leading to determinate verdicts regarding the defendant's legal obligation based on the article provided.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Assessing the Query's Validity Based on Logical Reasoning

The query presents a scenario where A manifests an intention to sell land X to B, knowing this doesn't reflect A's true intention. It further states that even if B could have known this and thus the manifestation is void, A cannot assert against C (a third party in good faith who purchases land X from B) the nullity of such a manifestation.

Based on Article 93(1), the validity of a manifestation isn't impaired if made with a mental reservation not reflecting one's true intention. However, if the other party could have known this wasn't the true intention (Article 93(1) proviso), the manifestation is void. Yet, as per Article 93(2), this nullity cannot be asserted against a third party in good faith.

Therefore, logically, the query accurately reflects the content of the article, making it **True**.

### Task 2: Assessing Whether the Query Expresses Each Factor

1. **The validity of a manifestation of intention is not impaired even if the person making it does so while knowing that it does not reflect that person's true intention.**
   - (query entails 1) The query directly involves A making a manifestation with knowledge that it doesn't reflect his true intention.

2. **The person making the manifestation knows that it does not reflect their true intention.**
   - (query entails 2) It is stated that A knows his manifestation to B doesn't reflect his true intention.

3. **The other party knew or could have known that the manifestation was not the true intention of the person who made it.**
   - (query entails 3) The query mentions "even if A's manifestation of intention is void because B could have known," indicating consideration of this factor.

4. **The manifestation of intention is void if the other party knew or could have known that it was not the true intention of the person who made it.**
   - (query entails 4) The query states the manifestation is void under these conditions, directly reflecting this principle.

5. **The nullity of a manifestation of intention under certain provisions may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith.**
   - (query entails 5) This is explicitly mentioned regarding C's purchase from B and A's inability to assert the nullity against C.

6. **A third party must be in good faith to be protected from the assertion of nullity.**
   - (query entails 6) The protection afforded to C is contingent upon C being "in good faith," fulfilling this condition.

These justifications align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True based on logical reasoning and the provided article.

### Task 3: Determining Defendant Obligation

Given the scenario, A (the defendant in this context) cannot assert against C (a third party in good faith) the nullity of the manifestation of intention. Thus, A is not obligated to have the manifestation recognized as valid by C due to C's good faith status.

Therefore, **pledged(0)**, indicating that based on the query and article, the defendant (A) does not have an obligation towards asserting or having the nullity recognized against a third party in good faith.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. The counterparty may demand a definite answer from the principal.
2. The demand must specify a reasonable period of time for the principal to give an answer.
3. The principal is being asked to confirm whether or not they will ratify within the specified period.
4. A reasonable period of time is specified for the principal to respond.
5. If the principal fails to give a definite answer within the specified period, 
6. The principal's failure to respond is related to their potential refusal to ratify.

Verdict: In this case, if the principal fails to give a definite answer within that period, the principal is deemed to have refused to ratify.

<Number of factors : 6>
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors from Article 114, I will generate six legal case scenarios. Each scenario will assume a unique subset of the factors and provide a justification for determining whether the principal (defendant) is legally obligated.

1. (1, 2 | Y)
In this case, the counterparty demands a definite answer from the principal (factor 1), specifying a reasonable period of time for the response (factor 2). Given that these conditions are met, it's reasonable to expect the principal to provide an answer within the specified timeframe. Failure to do so could imply a refusal to ratify, thus obligating the principal to be bound by their initial actions.

2. (3, 5 | N)
Here, the principal is asked to confirm whether or not they will ratify within the specified period (factor 3), and they fail to give a definite answer within that time (factor 5). However, without the specification of a reasonable period of time by the counterparty (factor 2) or an explicit demand for an answer (factor 1), it cannot be concluded that the principal's failure to respond automatically binds them. The lack of these formal requirements means the principal is not obligated.

3. (2, 4 | N)
In this scenario, a reasonable period of time is specified for the principal to respond (factor 4), and the demand must specify this timeframe (factor 2). However, without an explicit demand from the counterparty for a definite answer (factor 1) or the principal's confirmation regarding ratification (factor 3), it cannot be determined that the principal is obligated. The specification of time alone does not suffice to bind the principal.

4. (1, 4 | Y)
The counterparty demands a definite answer from the principal (factor 1), and a reasonable period of time is specified for the response (factor 4). Given these conditions, it's logical that the principal should respond within this timeframe. The combination of an explicit demand and a specified timeframe provides sufficient basis to consider the principal obligated if they fail to respond accordingly.

5. (3, 6 | Y)
In this case, the principal is asked to confirm whether or not they will ratify within the specified period (factor 3), and their failure to respond is related to their potential refusal to ratify (factor 6). This scenario directly ties the principal's response (or lack thereof) to their intention regarding ratification. Therefore, it can be inferred that if the principal fails to give a definite answer, they are deemed to have refused to ratify, thereby obligating them based on their implied decision.

6. (2, 5, 6 | Y)
Here, the demand must specify a reasonable period of time for the principal to give an answer (factor 2), the principal fails to give a definite answer within that specified period (factor 5), and this failure is related to their potential refusal to ratify (factor 6). Given these conditions, it's clear that the principal had both the opportunity and the obligation to respond within a reasonable timeframe. Their failure to do so, coupled with the implication of refusal, solidifies their obligation based on the initial demand and the specified timeframe for response.

Each scenario presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the principal's obligations.

 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determining True or False
The query states that if a principal fails to make a definite answer within a specified period regarding ratification of a contract concluded by an unauthorized agent, they are deemed to have ratified the contract. However, according to Article 114, if the principal fails to give a definite answer within the specified period, they are deemed to have refused to ratify, not ratified. Therefore, based on logical reasoning and the information provided in Article 114, the query is **False**.

### Task 2: Assessing Query Against Factors
1. **The counterparty may demand a definite answer from the principal.**
   - The query expresses this factor by mentioning that the counterparty requires the principal to make a definite answer.
   - (query entails 1)

2. **The demand must specify a reasonable period of time for the principal to give an answer.**
   - The query includes this by stating "by fixing a reasonable period of time."
   - (query entails 2)

3. **The principal is being asked to confirm whether or not they will ratify within the specified period.**
   - This is expressed in the query as requiring the principal "to make a definite answer on whether or not he/she will ratify within such period of time."
   - (query entails 3)

4. **A reasonable period of time is specified for the principal to respond.**
   - The query mentions "by fixing a reasonable period of time," which aligns with this factor.
   - (query entails 4)

5. **If the principal fails to give a definite answer within the specified period,**
   - The query addresses the consequence of the principal's failure to respond within the period.
   - (query entails 5)

6. **The principal's failure to respond is related to their potential refusal to ratify.**
   - However, the query incorrectly states that the principal is deemed to have ratified, contrary to Article 114 which states they are deemed to have refused to ratify.
   - The query does not accurately express this factor as per Article 114.
   - (query does not entail 6)

Justifications align with the result from Task 1, confirming the query is False due to its misinterpretation of the consequence of the principal's inaction.

### Task 3: Determining Obligation
Given that the query inaccurately represents the outcome of the principal's failure to respond (stating ratification instead of refusal to ratify), and considering the correct interpretation of Article 114, we must evaluate if the principal is obligated based on the accurate understanding of the law. According to the actual rule, if the principal fails to give a definite answer within the specified period, they are deemed to have refused to ratify, which means they do not become obligated by the contract due to their inaction being interpreted as refusal. However, since the query misrepresents this obligation (suggesting ratification and thus an obligation), but based on the corrected understanding that the principal is actually deemed to have refused (and thus not obligated), we consider the intent of Task 3:

- If the principal's inaction leads to a deemed refusal to ratify (as per Article 114), they are not obligated by the contract.
- The query mistakenly suggests an obligation through deemed ratification, which contradicts Article 114.

Therefore, considering the accurate legal stance and correcting for the query's mistake:

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 7 legal case scenarios, each with a unique combination of factors. Here are the cases:

(1 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable, as stated in factor 1. Therefore, if the defendant made such a manifestation, they can argue that it is voidable, and they are not obligated.

(2, 3 | N)
Justification: Although a third party committed a fraud inducing the first party to make a manifestation of intention (factor 3), the manifestation was made to a second party (factor 2). However, there is no indication that the second party knew or could have known about the fraud. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

(4 | Y)
Justification: The second party knew or could have known that a third party committed a fraud (factor 4). This implies that the second party had knowledge of the fraudulent circumstances surrounding the manifestation of intention. As a result, the defendant can be held obligated.

(1, 5 | Y)
Justification: A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable (factor 1), and the counterparty to the voidable act is identified (factor 5). Since the counterparty is identified, the defendant can make a manifestation of intention to void or ratify the act, which implies that they are obligated to take action.

(6 | N)
Justification: The voidance or ratification of a voidable act is made by the manifestation of intention (factor 6). However, there is no indication that such a manifestation has been made. Without this crucial step, the defendant cannot be held obligated.

(2, 4, 7 | Y)
Justification: The manifestation of intention was made to a second party (factor 2), the second party knew or could have known about the fraud (factor 4), and the manifestation of intention to void or ratify the act is made to the counterparty (factor 7). Given that all these conditions are met, it is likely that the defendant is obligated to fulfill their obligations.

(3, 5, 6 | N)
Justification: A third party committed a fraud inducing the first party to make a manifestation of intention (factor 3), the counterparty to the voidable act is identified (factor 5), and the voidance or ratification of the act is made by the manifestation of intention (factor 6). Although these factors suggest that the defendant's actions may be voidable, there is no indication that the second party knew or could have known about the fraud. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determining True or False
The query states that if A makes a manifestation of intention to sell an immovable to C because of the fraud by B, the third party, the rescission of that act is made by the manifestation of intention to both B and C. According to Article 96(2), if a third party commits a fraud inducing a first party to make a manifestation of intention to a second party, that manifestation of intention is voidable only if the second party knew or could have known that fact. Furthermore, Article 123 states that the voidance or ratification of a voidable act is made by the manifestation of intention to the counterparty.

Given this, for A to rescind the act (which was based on fraud), they would need to make a manifestation of intention to C, as C is the counterparty to the original voidable act. There's no direct requirement in the provided articles to notify B, the third party who committed the fraud, for the purpose of voiding or ratifying the act. Thus, based on the information given and logical reasoning, the query seems to misinterpret the necessity of involving B directly in the rescission process as described.

**Result: False**

### Task 2: Assessing Query Against Factors
1. **A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable.**
   - (query entails 1) The scenario involves a manifestation of intention based on fraud, which aligns with this factor.

2. **The manifestation of intention is made to a second party.**
   - (query entails 2) In the query, A makes a manifestation of intention to C, fitting this description.

3. **A third party commits a fraud inducing a first party to make a manifestation of intention.**
   - (query entails 3) B's fraud induces A's action, matching this factor.

4. **The second party knew or could have known that a third party committed a fraud.**
   - The query does not explicitly address C's knowledge about the fraud by B.
   
5. **The counterparty to a voidable act is identified.**
   - (query entails 5) C is identified as the counterparty in the scenario.

6. **The voidance or ratification of a voidable act is made by the manifestation of intention.**
   - (query entails 6) The query discusses rescission, which is a form of voiding the act, through manifestation of intention.

7. **The manifestation of intention to void or ratify a voidable act is made to the counterparty.**
   - While the query mentions making a manifestation of intention to both B and C for rescission, it inaccurately includes B as necessary for this process based on Article 123.
   
**Justification Alignment with Task 1 Result:**
The analysis supports the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is False because it misrepresents the necessity of notifying the third party (B) in the rescission process.

### Task 3: Determining Obligation
Given the scenario, A's obligation would be to notify C, as C is the counterparty to the voidable act. However, the query inaccurately suggests that A must make a manifestation of intention to both B and C for the rescission. The actual obligation based on the articles provided is not accurately represented by the query.

**Result: pledged(0)**

This result signifies that according to the information given and logical reasoning applied to the articles, the query does not correctly determine the defendant's obligations regarding the notification process for voiding a voidable act based on fraud.

Verdict: Any performance made to a person other than the person with right to performance is effective only to the extent that the obligee is enriched as a result thereof, and performance made to a person that does not constitute a person authorized to accept the performance but appears to be so is effective only if the person effecting performance was acting in good faith and without negligence.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided factors, I will generate six unique legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | Y)
Justification: In this case, the performance was made to a person other than the person with the right to performance. According to Article 479, any performance made to such a person is effective only to the extent that the obligee is enriched as a result thereof. Since factor 2 (the obligee is enriched) is not explicitly mentioned in this case, we assume it's not present. However, given the language of Article 479, the defendant could still be obligated if the performance had some effect on the obligee's enrichment, even if indirectly.

(3 | N)
Justification: The performance was made to a person that does not constitute a person authorized to accept the performance. Without any additional factors indicating good faith, lack of negligence, or apparent authority (factors 4, 5, and 6), Article 478 suggests that such a performance would not be effective in obligating the defendant.

(2 | Y)
Justification: The obligee was enriched as a result of the performance. Even if the performance was made to the wrong person (factor 1), according to Article 479, the performance is effective to the extent that the obligee is enriched. Therefore, the defendant could be obligated based on this enrichment.

(4 | N)
Justification: The person appears to be the person authorized to accept the performance in light of common sense in the transaction. However, without factors indicating actual authority (factor 3), good faith (factor 5), or lack of negligence (factor 6), this appearance alone does not obligate the defendant.

(1, 2 | Y)
Justification: The performance was made to a person other than the person with the right to performance, and the obligee is enriched as a result thereof. Directly applying Article 479, the performance is effective to the extent that the obligee is enriched, making the defendant obligated.

(5, 6 | Y)
Justification: The person effecting performance was acting in good faith and without negligence. Even though factors 3 and 4 are not mentioned (indicating the performance might have been made to an unauthorized person), Article 478 states that if the person appears to be authorized (factor 4, which we assume is not present here but could be inferred from the context of transactional common sense) and was acting in good faith and without negligence, the performance could be effective. Given these conditions of good faith and lack of negligence, it suggests a scenario where the defendant's actions are considered legitimate under the law, potentially obligating them based on the principles of fairness and justice implied by Article 478, even if not directly stated for this combination.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as defined:

### Task 1: Determining True or False
Based on Article 479, "any performance made to a person other than the person with right to performance is effective only to the extent that the obligee is enriched as a result thereof." The query states that B made a performance to C, who had no authority to receive it, but A was enriched. According to the article, even if B knew C had no authority (implying bad faith or negligence), the critical factor for the performance's effectiveness is whether the obligee (A) is enriched. Thus, despite B's knowledge or intent, the performance can still be effective to the extent A is enriched. Therefore, based on Article 479 alone and considering the specifics of the query, the statement in the query appears to align with the article's stipulation regarding enrichment as a determinant of effectiveness.

However, Article 478 introduces conditions for when a performance made to an unauthorized person can be effective (good faith and no negligence). Since B knew C had no authority, this suggests B was not acting in good faith or without negligence, potentially contradicting the conditions set forth in Article 478. Given these nuances, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the interplay between Articles 479 and 478, particularly concerning the conditions under which a performance to an unauthorized person can be considered effective.

Considering both articles together:
- Article 479 emphasizes the obligee's enrichment.
- Article 478 adds that for performances made to someone who appears authorized but is not, effectiveness requires good faith and no negligence on the part of the performer.

Given B knew C was unauthorized, it implies a lack of good faith or negligence. However, since A was enriched, there's a basis for the performance to have some effect based on Article 479. The query's assertion that "the performance shall have the effect to the extent A is enriched" seems to align more closely with Article 479's focus on enrichment but overlooks the good faith/negligence aspect critical in Article 478 when the recipient appears authorized but isn't.

Thus, considering both articles and focusing strictly on their wording:
- The query aligns with the principle of effectiveness based on enrichment (Article 479) but may not fully account for the nuances introduced by Article 478 regarding good faith and negligence.
Given this complexity and focusing on the question's core: whether the performance has an effect to the extent A is enriched, despite B's knowledge or intent, **the query could be considered True** in a narrow reading focused on enrichment as a criterion for effectiveness but requires careful consideration of both articles' stipulations.

### Task 2: Assessing Factors
1. The performance is made to a person other than the person with the right to performance.
   - (query entails 1) because it mentions B making the performance vis-a-vis C, who had no authority.

2. The obligee is enriched as a result of the performance.
   - (query entails 2) since it states A was enriched as a result thereof.

3. The performance is made to a person that does not constitute a person authorized to accept the performance.
   - (query entails 3) because C had no authority to receive the performance.

4. The person appears to be the person authorized to accept the performance in light of common sense in the transaction.
   - The query does not explicitly mention this aspect, so it does not directly entail factor 4.

5. The person effecting performance was acting in good faith.
   - The query suggests the opposite; B knew C had no authority, implying bad faith or at least knowledge that might negate good faith.

6. The person effecting performance was without negligence.
   - Similarly, knowing C's lack of authority but proceeding implies negligence, so this is not entailed by the query.

These assessments show the query directly addresses factors 1, 2, and 3 but does not align with or explicitly mention factors 4, 5, or 6 in a way that supports their conditions for performance effectiveness.

### Task 3: Determining Obligation
Given the nuances and focusing on whether the query determines the defendant (B) obligated:
- The query implies B's action (performance to C) has an effect due to A's enrichment, which suggests some level of obligation being met or considered.
However, it does not directly address whether B is fully obligated or if this performance satisfies all obligations towards A. Thus, based on the information given and focusing strictly on the determination of obligation:
- **pledged(1)** seems appropriate as the query implies an effect of B's action on their obligation to A, even though the full context of their obligations isn't detailed.

Therefore, the final answers are:
- For Task 1: The query can be considered True under a specific interpretation focusing on enrichment.
- For Task 2: 
  - (query entails 1)
  - (query entails 2)
  - (query entails 3)
  And it does not directly support or entail factors 4, 5, or 6 based on the query's details.
- For Task 3: **pledged(1)**

======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article, I will generate 12 unique legal case scenarios. Each scenario assumes a subset of the factors occurred and provides a justification for determining whether the defendant is legally obligated.

1. (1 | N)
In this case, succession involving a revolving mortgagee commences before the principal is crystallized. However, without any additional factors, such as secured claims or agreements, the defendant's obligation cannot be determined as pledged solely based on the commencement of succession.

2. (2, 3 | Y)
Here, the revolving mortgage secures the claims that exist at the time of the commencement of succession, and it otherwise secures claims agreed upon by the heirs and the mortgagor. Given these factors, the defendant is legally obligated to secure these claims.

3. (4 | N)
An heir acquires claims after the commencement of succession, but without an agreement between the parties involved, the revolving mortgage's security over these acquired claims is not established. Therefore, the defendant cannot be considered pledged based solely on this factor.

4. (5, 6 | Y)
Succession involving an obligor commences before the principal is crystallized, and the revolving mortgage secures the obligations that exist at the time of the commencement of succession. The presence of these factors indicates that the defendant has a legal obligation to secure these existing obligations.

5. (7 | N)
The revolving mortgage otherwise secures claims agreed upon by the revolving mortgagee and the mortgagor, but without any specific agreement or context provided in this scenario, it's unclear what claims are being secured. Thus, the defendant's obligation remains undetermined.

6. (8, 9 | Y)
An heir assumes obligations after the commencement of succession, which are secured by the revolving mortgage if agreed upon, and an agreement is reached between the parties involved. Given these factors, the defendant is legally obligated to secure the assumed obligations as per the agreement.

7. (10 | N)
The provisions of Article 398-4, paragraph (2) apply mutatis mutandis if an agreement is reached, but without knowing the specifics of the agreement or how these provisions affect the defendant's obligation, we cannot determine a pledge based solely on this factor.

8. (1, 11 | Y)
Succession involving a revolving mortgagee commences before the principal is crystallized, and the agreements referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) are not registered within six months of the commencement of succession. Given that the agreements were not registered, the principal secured is deemed to have been crystallized at the time of the commencement of succession, implying the defendant has a legal obligation.

9. (3, 4 | Y)
The revolving mortgage otherwise secures claims agreed upon by the heirs and the mortgagor, and an heir acquires claims after the commencement of succession, which are secured if agreed upon. With these factors, it's clear that any acquired claims agreed upon by the parties are secured, indicating a legal obligation for the defendant.

10. (2, 5 | N)
The revolving mortgage secures the claims that exist at the time of the commencement of succession, and succession involving an obligor commences before the principal is crystallized. Although these factors establish some level of security, they do not directly imply an obligation on the part of the defendant without further context or agreement.

11. (6, 9 | Y)
The revolving mortgage secures the obligations that exist at the time of the commencement of succession, and an agreement is reached between the parties involved regarding secured claims or obligations. The combination of securing existing obligations and having a formal agreement supports the conclusion that the defendant is legally obligated.

12. (11, 12 | Y)
The agreements referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) are not registered within six months of the commencement of succession, and the principal secured is deemed to have been crystallized at the time of the commencement of succession if the agreements are not registered. This scenario directly implies that due to the lack of registration, the defendant's obligation is determined as pledged because the principal secured is crystallized by default.

 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the results:

1. A party to a claim may manifest the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim, referred to as the "manifestation of intention to restrict assignment".
2. The manifestation of intention to restrict assignment does not impair the validity of the assignment of the claim.
3. The obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party, such as the assignee.
4. The assignee's knowledge or lack of knowledge due to gross negligence about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment is relevant.
5. The obligor may assert against the assignee any event that results in extinguishment of the obligation, such as payment to the assignor.

Number of factors : 5

Verdict: Even if a party to a claim manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim, the validity of the assignment of the claim is not impaired.
======== Generate Examples:
 Based on the provided article and factors, I will generate 5 legal case scenarios. Here they are:

(1 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 1 occurs, where a party to a claim manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim. However, since the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment does not impair the validity of the assignment (as per factor 2), and there is no information about the assignee's knowledge or the obligor's actions, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated.

(2 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 2 occurs, where the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment does not impair the validity of the assignment. This implies that the assignment is valid, and therefore, the defendant (assignee) is obligated to perform their part of the obligation.

(3 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, only factor 3 occurs, where the obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party, such as the assignee. However, without knowing whether the assignee had knowledge about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment or whether an event resulting in extinguishment of the obligation occurred, we cannot conclude that the defendant is not obligated solely based on this factor.

(1, 4 | N)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 1 and 4 occur. The party manifests the intention to restrict assignment (factor 1), and the assignee has knowledge or lacks knowledge due to gross negligence about this manifestation (factor 4). Although the assignee's knowledge is relevant, since factor 2 (which states that the manifestation does not impair the validity of the assignment) is not present in this scenario, we cannot determine the defendant's obligation solely based on these two factors.

(2, 3, 5 | Y)
Justification: In this scenario, factors 2, 3, and 5 occur. The manifestation of intention to restrict assignment does not impair the validity of the assignment (factor 2), allowing for a valid assignment. The obligor may refuse to perform the obligation (factor 3), but since factor 5 indicates that any event resulting in extinguishment of the obligation can be asserted against the assignee, and given that the assignment is valid (factor 2), it suggests that the defendant (assignee) has a legitimate claim unless an event of extinguishment occurred. Therefore, without evidence of such an event, the defendant is obligated.

Note: Each case presents a unique combination of factors to determine whether the defendant is legally obligated or not, ensuring no two cases use the same combination.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined:

### Task 1: Determining True or False
Based on Article 466 (2) and (3), even if a party to a claim manifests an intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim, the validity of the assignment is not impaired. However, the obligor may refuse performance to a third party (assignee) who knew or should have known about this restriction and can assert any event leading to obligation extinguishment against such a party.

Given the query: Claim X has a special agreement prohibiting assignment but was assigned from C to D, with D not knowing about the prohibition without gross negligence. The article suggests that B may refuse performance to D if D knew or should have known (due to gross negligence) about the restriction. Since D does not know and it's specified "without gross negligence," this aligns with a scenario where B might not be able to refuse based on the special agreement, as D's lack of knowledge isn't due to gross negligence.

Thus, considering the specifics of Article 466 (3), if D genuinely doesn't know about the prohibition without being grossly negligent, it seems plausible that B may not refuse performance based solely on the assignment restriction. Therefore, the query statement appears **True** under these conditions.

### Task 2: Assessing Query Against Factors
1. A party to a claim may manifest the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim.
   - (query entails 1) The query mentions a "special agreement prohibiting the assignment," which directly relates to this factor.

2. The manifestation of intention to restrict assignment does not impair the validity of the assignment of the claim.
   - (query entails 2) This is implicitly considered, as the focus is on whether B can refuse performance despite the assignment being valid.

3. The obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party, such as the assignee.
   - (query entails 3) The query discusses B's potential refusal to perform based on the special agreement and D's knowledge of it.

4. The assignee's knowledge or lack of knowledge due to gross negligence about the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment is relevant.
   - (query entails 4) The scenario specifies D's lack of knowledge "without gross negligence," directly engaging with this factor.

5. The obligor may assert against the assignee any event that results in extinguishment of the obligation, such as payment to the assignor.
   - This factor isn't explicitly addressed in the query, which focuses on refusal of performance due to assignment restrictions rather than events leading to obligation extinguishment.

Justifications align with Task 1's conclusion that the query scenario appears plausible under Article 466 conditions, especially considering D's innocent lack of knowledge about the assignment restriction.

### Task 3: Determining Obligation
Given the context and assuming "pledged" refers to whether the defendant (B) is obligated to perform despite the special agreement against assignment, if we follow the logic that B may not refuse performance to D due to D's innocent ignorance of the prohibition:

- pledged(1) would indicate B is obligated.
- pledged(0) would indicate B is not obligated.

Based on our analysis and considering D does not know about the prohibition "without gross negligence," it leans towards B being obligated to perform, as the conditions under which B could refuse (knowledge or gross negligence of the assignee) are not met in D's case. Therefore:

pledged(1)

This reflects that, under the given scenario and interpretation of Article 466, B would likely be obligated to perform the obligation to D.

 After carefully reading the provided article, I have broken down the text into sentences or phrases that represent factors used to determine the verdict in cases applying the article. Here are the factors:

1. The subject matter delivered to the buyer does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind, quality, or quantity.
2. The buyer may demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance by repairing the subject matter, delivering a substitute, or delivering replenishment.
3. The seller may cure the non-conformity of performance by a method that is different from the method demanded by the buyer.
4. The different method used by the seller must not impose any undue burden on the buyer.
5. The non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer.

Number of factors : 6

Verdict: The buyer may demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance, unless the non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate the legal case scenarios based on the provided factors from Article 562, we will follow the instructions carefully. Since there are 6 factors, we will create 6 unique case scenarios, each assuming a different subset of these factors has occurred.

### Case Scenario 1
(1 | Y)
Justification: The subject matter delivered does not conform to the contract terms regarding kind, quality, or quantity (Factor 1). According to Article 562(1), this situation allows the buyer to demand that the seller cure the non-conformity. Therefore, the defendant (seller) is legally obligated.

### Case Scenario 2
(2 | Y)
Justification: The buyer has demanded that the seller cure the non-conformity by repairing the subject matter, delivering a substitute, or replenishment (Factor 2). This demand directly aligns with the buyer's rights as stated in Article 562(1), indicating the defendant is obligated to comply.

### Case Scenario 3
(3 | N)
Justification: The seller may cure the non-conformity by a method different from what the buyer demanded (Factor 3), but this factor alone does not establish an obligation without considering whether it imposes an undue burden on the buyer or if the non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer. Without additional context, we cannot conclusively determine the defendant's obligation based solely on their choice of cure method.

### Case Scenario 4
(4 | Y)
Justification: The seller's chosen method of curing the non-conformity does not impose any undue burden on the buyer (Factor 4). Since this aligns with the conditions under which a seller can choose an alternative cure method as per Article 562(1), and assuming the non-conformity is not due to the buyer, the defendant is obligated to proceed with the cure.

### Case Scenario 5
(5 | N)
Justification: The non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer (Factor 5). According to Article 562(2), if the non-conformity is the buyer's fault, the buyer cannot demand that the seller cure it. Therefore, the defendant is not obligated.

### Case Scenario 6
(1, 3, 4 | Y)
Justification: The subject matter does not conform to the contract (Factor 1), the seller chooses a different method of cure (Factor 3), and this method does not impose an undue burden on the buyer (Factor 4). Given these conditions, Article 562(1) supports the buyer's right to demand cure and the seller's flexibility in choosing the cure method, provided it doesn't unduly burden the buyer. Thus, the defendant is obligated.

Each case presents a unique combination of factors leading to a determinate verdict regarding the defendant's obligation based on Article 562.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that if the non-conformity of movable X (delivered by seller B to buyer A) is due to grounds attributable to A, then A may not request B to either repair X or reduce the price. According to Article 562(2), "If the non-conformity referred to in the preceding paragraph is due to grounds attributable to the buyer, the buyer may not demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance under the provisions of that paragraph." This directly supports the query's statement regarding the buyer's inability to demand repair or other forms of cure (which could include price reduction as a form of compensation for non-conformity) if the non-conformity is due to their own actions. Therefore, based on the article provided, the query is **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The subject matter delivered to the buyer does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind, quality, or quantity.**
   - Query entails this factor because it mentions that "the quality of movable X... does not conform to the terms of the contract."

2. **The buyer may demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance by repairing the subject matter, delivering a substitute, or delivering replenishment.**
   - The query implies a situation where such demands could be made but focuses on the condition under which they cannot (i.e., when the non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer). Thus, it indirectly considers this factor.

3. **The seller may cure the non-conformity of performance by a method that is different from the method demanded by the buyer.**
   - The query does not directly address the seller's ability to choose an alternative method for curing the non-conformity, so it does not explicitly express this factor.

4. **The different method used by the seller must not impose any undue burden on the buyer.**
   - This factor is not mentioned or implied in the query.

5. **The non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer.**
   - The query directly states that "the non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to A," thus it expresses this factor.

6. **If the non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer, the buyer may not demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance.**
   - The query directly aligns with this factor by stating that if the non-conformity is due to A's actions, A may not request B to repair X or reduce the price.

Justifications for these assessments align with the conclusion from Task 1 that the query is True based on the provided article.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given the context of the tasks and the information provided, the query's focus is on determining the buyer's (A) rights under specific conditions rather than directly stating an obligation of the seller (B) or the buyer. However, it implies that if the non-conformity is not due to grounds attributable to the buyer, the seller could be obligated to cure the non-conformity upon demand. Since the query specifically outlines a scenario where the buyer may not demand cure due to their own fault, it suggests conditions under which obligations might arise but does so in a manner that focuses on limitations of the buyer's rights rather than direct obligations.

Thus, considering the implication and focus of the query:
- **pledged(0)** because the query primarily addresses the limitation on the buyer's right to demand cure rather than directly stating an obligation of either party under all circumstances.

======== Generate Angelic-based factors: ========
 To break down Article 492 into its constituent factors for determining verdicts in applicable cases:

1. The obligor tenders the performance.
2. Tendering the performance relieves the obligor.
3. The relief is from any and all responsibilities.
4. The responsibilities arise from the non-performance of the obligation.

Given these steps, we identify that there are key elements involved in applying Article 492 to a case:

<Number of factors : 4>

Verdict: Upon tendering the performance, the obligor is relieved from any and all responsibilities which may arise from the non-performance of the obligation.
======== Generate Examples:
 To generate legal case scenarios based on the factors of Article 492, we will create four distinct cases, each assuming a different subset of the factors has occurred. The factors are:

1. The obligor tenders the performance.
2. Tendering the performance relieves the obligor.
3. The relief is from any and all responsibilities.
4. The responsibilities arise from the non-performance of the obligation.

Here are the case scenarios:

### Case 1: (1, 2 | Y)
In this scenario, the obligor tenders the performance (Factor 1) and tendering the performance relieves the obligor (Factor 2). Since both conditions necessary for relief are met according to Article 492, the defendant is obligated to be relieved from responsibilities arising from non-performance. Thus, the verdict is Yes (Y).

### Case 2: (3, 4 | N)
Here, the relief is from any and all responsibilities (Factor 3), and the responsibilities arise from the non-performance of the obligation (Factor 4). However, without the actual tendering of performance or the acknowledgment that this act relieves the obligor, we cannot conclude that the defendant is obligated to be relieved based solely on these factors. Thus, the verdict is No (N).

### Case 3: (1, 3 | N)
In this case, the obligor tenders the performance (Factor 1), and the relief is from any and all responsibilities (Factor 3). Although the performance is tendered, without the factor that specifies this act as a means of relief for the obligor, we cannot definitively say the defendant is obligated to be relieved. Hence, the verdict is No (N).

### Case 4: (2, 4 | N)
This scenario involves tendering the performance relieves the obligor (Factor 2) and the responsibilities arise from the non-performance of the obligation (Factor 4). Since the actual act of tendering the performance (Factor 1) is missing, we cannot apply Article 492 fully to determine the defendant's obligations regarding relief from responsibilities. Therefore, the verdict is No (N).

Each case presents a unique combination of factors, ensuring no duplication and allowing for a clear determination of the defendant's legal obligations based on Article 492.

======= Query Entaiments:
 To address the tasks as outlined:

### Task 1: Determine whether the query is True or False based on logical reasoning.

The query states that in cases where the obligor of a monetary debt provides actual performance on the time of performance, but the obligee refuses to accept the performance, the obligor does not carry the duty to pay delinquent charges after the provision. This statement aligns with the principle outlined in Article 492, which suggests that upon tendering the performance, the obligor is relieved from any and all responsibilities arising from the non-performance of the obligation. Since the query involves a scenario where the obligor has attempted to fulfill their obligation (by providing actual performance on time) but is prevented from doing so by the obligee's refusal, it logically follows that the obligor should not be held responsible for delinquent charges. Thus, based on logical reasoning and the principles outlined in Article 492, the query appears to be **True**.

### Task 2: Assess whether the query expresses each factor and justify the reasoning.

1. **The obligor tenders the performance**: The query explicitly mentions that the obligor provides actual performance on the time of performance, which directly aligns with this factor.
   - (query entails 1)

2. **Tendering the performance relieves the obligor**: The query implies relief by stating the obligor does not carry the duty to pay delinquent charges after the provision, suggesting that tendering performance leads to some form of relief for the obligor.
   - (query entails 2)

3. **The relief is from any and all responsibilities**: The query specifies that the obligor does not have to pay delinquent charges, which can be seen as a type of responsibility arising from non-performance or delayed acceptance of performance.
   - (query entails 3)

4. **The responsibilities arise from the non-performance of the obligation**: While the query mentions refusal by the obligee rather than non-performance by the obligor, it still addresses a scenario where the intended performance is not completed due to circumstances beyond the obligor's control, indirectly relating to the concept of responsibilities arising from how the obligation is handled.
   - (query entails 4)

Justifications for all factors align with the initial assessment that the query is **True** based on Article 492.

### Task 3: Determine whether the query determines the defendant obligated.

Given that the query suggests the obligor does not carry the duty to pay delinquent charges after attempting to fulfill their obligation, it implies that the defendant (in this context, likely the obligor) is **not** determined to be obligated to pay such charges due to circumstances beyond their control. Thus, the representation should be:
- pledged(0)

In summary:

1. The query is assessed as **True** based on logical reasoning and Article 492.
2. The query entails factors 1, 2, 3, and 4 as outlined.
3. The defendant is not determined to be obligated; hence, pledged(0).
