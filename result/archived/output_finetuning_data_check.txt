======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that an owner has the rights to freely use, profit from, and dispose of the thing owned within the limits of laws and regulations. Therefore, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: An owner has the right to freely use, profit from, and dispose of their property.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The existence of laws and regulations limiting the exercise of ownership.
- **A2**: The methods by which a third party might hinder the exercise of ownership, such as through possession or other means.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2, we have:
- **B1**: Hindrance through possession of the thing.
- **B2**: Hindrance using methods other than possession.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Given the context:
- **A1** denies **R1** because laws and regulations can limit an owner's rights.
- **A2** denies **R1** as hindrances can prevent the exercise of ownership rights.
- **B1** supports **A2** since possession by another is a method to hinder the owner's rights.
- **B2** also supports **A2** because methods other than possession can similarly hinder an owner.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
The structure adheres to the criteria:
- Existence of a Root Node (**R1**).
- Single Directed Linkage for each factor.
- Clear definition and representation of context and relationships.
- Adherence to the node naming convention (R, A, B) and link representation format.

### Justification
Given the query: "If person B hinders the exercise of ownership for a thing owned by person A using methods other than possession of the thing, person A's ability to demand the removal or discontinuance of the disturbance from B based on ownership is limited to when person A incurs serious and considerable irreparable damage due to person B's disturbance."

- The query entails **B2** because it specifically mentions hindrance through means other than possession.
- To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with **R1**, we examine the scenario. **R1** states an owner has rights over their property, but the query introduces a condition (irreparable damage) under which these rights can be asserted against a third party's disturbance. This condition does not negate **R1** but rather specifies circumstances under which those rights are actionable in court. Therefore, the query essentially agrees with **R1** by acknowledging an owner's rights and outlining a specific scenario where those rights are enforceable.

Upon re-justification:
- The assertion that the query entails **B2** stands because it directly deals with hindrances not involving possession.
- The agreement between the query and **R1** also holds. The query specifies conditions under which an owner can demand relief, implying recognition of ownership rights as stated in **R1**, albeit with specific circumstances for enforcement.

Output:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article states that "Possessory rights may be acquired through an agent." Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: Possessory rights can be acquired through an agent.

This establishes the legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

To validate or invalidate the conclusion of R1, we consider the following abstract factors:
- **A1**: The capability of agents to acquire possessory rights on behalf of their principals.
- **A2**: The legal effect of possession by an agent belonging to the principal.

These abstract factors either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion regarding the acquisition of possessory rights through an agent.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors:
- **B1** (under A1): An agent's action can lead to the acquisition of possessory rights for their principal.
- **B2** (under A2): The legal effect of an agent's possession is attributed to the principal, not the agent personally.

These base-level factors directly apply to specific conditions related to the acquisition and attribution of possessory rights.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- **(B1 supports A1)**: An agent's action leading to the acquisition of possessory rights supports the capability of agents to acquire such rights on behalf of their principals.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The legal effect being attributed to the principal supports the principle that possession by an agent belongs to the principal.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The capability of agents to acquire possessory rights supports the conclusion that possessory rights can be acquired through an agent.
- **(A2 denies R1 in a specific context)**: While A2 does not deny R1 outright, it clarifies or limits the effect of R1 by stating that the benefit (possessory right) goes to the principal, not the agent. However, this doesn't directly deny R1 but rather specifies its application.

### Justification

Given the query "An agent may even acquire a possessory right, but since the effect of possession by the agent belongs to the principle, the agent him/herself may not acquire an individual possessory right for the thing possessed.":

- **(query entails B2)**: The query specifically mentions that the effect of possession by the agent belongs to the principal, aligning with B2.
  
Considering the agreement or disagreement with the root node (R1):
- The query essentially agrees with R1 in that it acknowledges an agent can acquire a possessory right but specifies that this right is for the benefit of the principal, not the agent themselves. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances of legal interpretation and the specifics of how possessory rights are attributed:
- The query's clarification on the attribution of possessory rights to the principal rather than the agent personally does not contradict but rather clarifies the conditions under which R1 operates. Thus, the initial assessment that **(query agree R1)** remains valid.

Therefore, the final output is:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 1
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish or refute the timing for filing actions related to possession, specifically focusing on when an action for recovery of possession must be brought.

- **Root Node (R1):** An action for recovery of possession must be filed within a specific time frame from the occurrence of the dispossession event.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- The nature of the dispossession (forcible).
- The timing of the filing of the action relative to the dispossession.
- The existence of any conditions that might affect the ability to file such an action, like obstruction or damage due to construction work.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Forcible Dispossession
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Timing of Filing Action

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1) for A1:** The dispossession occurred through force.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) for A2:** The action is filed within one year from the time of dispossession.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1):** B1 directly relates to the nature of the dispossession, supporting the relevance of forcible dispossession.
- **(B2 supports A2):** B2 specifies the timing condition for filing an action for recovery of possession, directly supporting the abstract factor related to the timing of filing.

### Analysis Based on ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the query: "An action for recovery of possession must be brought within one year from the time when possession was unlawfully usurped."

- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query specifically mentions a time frame ("within one year") and an event ("unlawfully usurped"), which aligns with the considerations in B2 (filing within one year) and indirectly touches upon the concept of dispossession, but it uses "unlawfully usurped" instead of "forcibly dispossessed." Despite this semantic difference, the essence of both phrases points to an illegal or unjust taking of possession.

- **(query entails B2):** Because the query specifies a time frame similar to what is outlined in B2 for filing an action after dispossession.

### Comparison with Root Node
The root node (R1) focuses on the necessity of filing an action for recovery of possession within a specific time frame from the occurrence of the dispossession event. The query essentially agrees with this verdict by also specifying a time-sensitive requirement for such actions, albeit using slightly different terminology regarding the nature of the dispossession.

- **(query agree R1):** Given that both the root node and the query emphasize the importance of timing in filing an action for recovery of possession, they fundamentally agree on the need for prompt legal action following dispossession.

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances in terminology ("forcibly dispossessed" vs. "unlawfully usurped") and the core message both convey about the timing and nature of actions for recovery of possession, it's clear that while there are semantic differences, the essence of the query aligns with the principles established by the root node and its supporting factors.

Therefore, the final assessment remains:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

wrong prediction case 2
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the outcome or legal conclusion established by the article. In this case:
- **R1**: A third party acquires possessory rights if a thing is possessed through an agent and the principal orders the agent to thenceforward possess that thing on behalf of the third party, with the consent of the third party.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion:
- **A1**: The possession is through an agent.
- **A2**: The principal orders the agent to possess the thing on behalf of a third party.
- **A3**: The third party consents to the arrangement.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The agent is in possession of a moveable item.
  - **B2**: The principal is the owner and depositor of the moveable item.
- Under **A2**, we refine to:
  - **B3**: The principal gives a direct order to the agent regarding the change in possession status.
- Under **A3**, refining gives us:
  - **B4**: The third party explicitly agrees to the new possessory arrangement.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor supports the root node, and each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**
- **(B4 supports A3)**
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**

### Analysis of the Query
The query presents a scenario where person A (the owner and depositor of a moveable item) orders person B (the depositary) to thenceforward possess the moveable on behalf of person C, with person C consenting thereto. We need to determine if this query entails any base-level factors and if it agrees or disagrees with the root node.

- The scenario directly involves **B1** (the agent is in possession of a moveable item), **B2** (the principal is the owner and depositor of the moveable item), **B3** (the principal gives a direct order to the agent regarding the change in possession status), and **B4** (the third party explicitly agrees to the new possessory arrangement). Thus, **(query entails B1)**, **(query entails B2)**, **(query entails B3)**, and **(query entails B4)**.
- Given that all base-level factors are entailed and they support their respective abstract factors which in turn support the root node **R1**, it follows that the query agrees with **R1**. The scenario described in the query aligns with the conditions outlined for acquiring possessory rights by a third party, as per Article 184.

Therefore, after careful analysis:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query entails B3)**
- **(query entails B4)**
- **(query agree R1)**

This conclusion is based on the step-by-step application of the ANGELIC structure formation criteria to the given legal provisions and query.

correct prediction case 3
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node should represent the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 182, the primary focus is on how the transfer of possessory rights is effected, which can be summarized as:
- **R1:** The transfer of possessory rights can be effected through either the delivery of the thing possessed or by manifestations of intention if certain conditions are met.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
These factors will validate or invalidate the conclusion in R1. From Article 182, we can derive:
- **A1:** The method of transfer involves physical delivery.
- **A2:** The method of transfer involves manifestations of intention without physical delivery, under specific conditions.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific conditions gives us:
- **B1:** Physical delivery of the possessed thing is made.
- **B2:** The transferee or their agent already holds the thing under possession, allowing for transfer through intention manifestation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Given the nature of A1 and A2 in relation to R1:
- **(B1 supports A1):** Physical delivery directly supports the method of transferring possessory rights as outlined in Article 182.
- **(B2 supports A2):** The condition where the transferee already holds the thing under possession supports the transfer through manifestations of intention.

Since Abstract Factors should link to either support or deny the Root Node (and not directly to Base-Level Factors), we correct our approach for establishing links:
- **(A1 supports R1):** The method involving physical delivery supports the main conclusion on transferring possessory rights.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The method involving manifestations of intention also supports the main conclusion, under specific conditions.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "If person A, who is the owner and lessor of a moveable, enters into a sales contract with person B, who received the transfer as a lessee, then person A loses the possessory right for the moveable due to the manifestation of intention of person A and person B to the effect that the possessory right is transferred."

This scenario aligns with **B2**, as it involves a situation where the transferee (person B) already has possession under a lease, and the transfer occurs through manifestations of intention between person A and person B.

Thus, we can say: **(query entails B2)**.

Given that B2 supports A2, and A2 in turn supports R1, it implies that the query aligns with the conditions under which possessory rights can be transferred as per Article 182. Therefore, the query agrees with the root node's conclusion on how possessory rights are transferred.

Hence: **(query agree R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of the scenario and the legal framework provided by Article 182, it's clear that the transfer of possessory rights through manifestations of intention when the transferee already holds the item under possession is a valid method according to the article. This aligns with both the base-level factor B2 and ultimately supports the root node R1's broader conclusion on methods for transferring possessory rights.

Therefore, the final assessment remains that **(query entails B2)** and **(query agree R1)**.

correct prediction case 4
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process step by step according to the provided legal provisions and the query about person B losing possessory rights for a moveable after entering into a deposit contract with person C.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should represent the core legal conclusion or verdict that we are evaluating. Based on Article 181 and the scenario described, the root node could be:
- R1: Person B loses possessory rights for the moveable after transferring it to person C.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These factors will either support or deny the conclusion represented by the root node. From the articles provided:
- A1: The requirement for consent from the bailor (person A) before the bailee (person B) can transfer custody of the bailed thing to a third party.
- A2: The acquisition and maintenance of possessory rights through agency or contract.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Breaking down abstract factors further:
- Under A1, we could have:
  - B1: Person B obtained consent from person A to transfer the moveable to person C.
  - B2: The nature of the deposit contract between person B and person C affects possessory rights.
- Under A2, we might consider:
  - B3: The initial acquisition of possessory rights by person B as a depositary for person A.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (B1 supports A1) because having consent directly fulfills the condition set forth in Article 658.
- (B2 supports A1) since the contract details could influence whether the transfer is legitimate under the law.
- (B3 supports A2) as it establishes how possessory rights were initially obtained.

Given these steps, we can analyze the query:
- The query entails B1 because it mentions person B getting approval from person A before entering into a deposit contract with person C.
- The query also seems to agree with R1 in that transferring the moveable under these conditions results in person B losing possessory rights for the moveable.

Therefore, based on the analysis:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

Justifying this conclusion involves understanding that according to Article 658, a bailee must obtain consent before allowing a third party to keep the bailed thing. Since person B did get approval and then entered into a contract with person C, it suggests a transfer of custody or possessory rights, aligning with the scenario where person B would lose their possessory rights over the moveable as per the query's context. This justification supports both the entailment of the base-level factor B1 and the agreement with the root node R1 regarding the loss of possessory rights by person B.

correct prediction case 5
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and query, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 183 is that if an agent manifests the intention to thenceforward possess a thing under the agent's own possession on behalf of the principal, the principal thereby acquires the possessory rights.
- **Root Node (R1):** The principal acquires possessory rights when the agent intends to possess the thing on their behalf.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Manifestation of intention by the agent to possess the thing on behalf of the principal.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The existence of a contract or agreement between the parties (in this case, a sale contract and a loan contract for use) that could influence the manifestation of intention.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The agent's explicit agreement to possess the moveable on behalf of another party as part of a loan contract for use.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The simultaneous existence of a sale contract that may complicate or clarify the intention behind possessing the moveable.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Because an explicit agreement to possess something on behalf of another directly manifests the required intention.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: As it clarifies the context in which the possession and contracts are being considered, potentially influencing how the manifestation of intention is interpreted.

### Query Analysis:
Given the query about person A (the owner) entering into a sale contract with person B and simultaneously entering into a loan contract for use where person B is the lender and person A is the borrower, we analyze if this scenario entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root node's verdict.

- **(Query entails B1)**: The query involves an explicit agreement (loan contract for use) that can be seen as person A intending to possess the moveable on behalf of person B.
- **(Query entails B2)**: It also involves a simultaneous sale contract, which could influence how we understand the intention behind the possession.

### Agreement with Root Node:
Considering the most comparable scenario and focusing on the core issue of whether the principal (in this case, person B) acquires possessory rights due to the agent's (person A) manifestation of intention:

- **(Query agree R1)**: If we interpret the loan contract for use as a clear manifestation by person A to possess the moveable on behalf of person B, then according to Article 183, person B would acquire the possessory rights. This interpretation aligns with the root node's verdict that the principal acquires possessory rights when there is such a manifestation of intention.

Upon re-justification, considering the specifics of contract law and the implications of simultaneous contracts (sale and loan for use) on the possession and ownership rights:

The final answer is: $\boxed{(Query entails B1), (Query agree R1)}$

wrong prediction case 6
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the articles seems to establish the principle that boundary markers are presumed to be co-owned by neighbors when installed on boundary lines, and there is a shared responsibility for their installation and maintenance costs. Thus, the root node could be:
- **R1**: Boundary markers installed on boundary lines are presumed to be co-owned by neighboring landowners.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The legal principle of shared responsibility for boundary markers.
- **A2**: The presumption of co-ownership of boundary installations.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors, we have:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: Neighboring landowners share the expenses for installing and maintaining boundary markers.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: Boundary markers installed as a result of cooperation between neighbors are presumed to be co-owned.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **B1 supports A1** because sharing expenses directly relates to the shared responsibility principle.
- **B2 supports A2** since it specifies a scenario where the presumption of co-ownership applies.
- **A1 supports R1** as shared responsibility is a basis for presumed co-ownership.
- **A2 supports R1** because it directly addresses the presumption of co-ownership.

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation Format
Followed as instructed:
- Root Node: **R1**
- Abstract Factors: **A1**, **A2**
- Base-Level Factors: **B1**, **B2**

Given the query, "An owner of one part of neighboring land may demand the cooperation of another owner of the land in installing boundary markers at shared cost, and the boundary markers installed as a result of that cooperation shall be presumed to be co-owned by the neighbors.":

- The query entails **B1** because it discusses sharing costs for boundary markers, which aligns with the principle of shared expenses.
- The query entails **B2** since it mentions the presumption of co-ownership resulting from cooperative installation of boundary markers.

Considering the root node **R1**, the query agrees with **R1**. Both state that boundary markers installed on boundary lines are presumed to be co-owned by neighbors, emphasizing shared responsibility and cooperation in their installation and maintenance.

Thus, the output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 7
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 234 is that after a year lapses from the time when construction started or if the building has been completed, the owner of the adjacent land may not demand changes to the building and may only claim damages.
   - **Root Node (R1):** "The owner of neighboring land cannot demand changes to a building but can only claim damages after one year from the start of construction or upon completion of the building."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - **Abstract Factor (A1):** The requirement for maintaining a distance of 50 centimeters or more from the boundary line when constructing a building.
   - **Abstract Factor (A2):** The time frame and construction status affecting legal remedies available to the neighboring landowner.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - Refining A1:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Construction within less than 50 centimeters from the boundary line.
     - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Construction exactly at or more than 50 centimeters away from the boundary line.
   - Refining A2:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The construction has been ongoing for less than one year and is not completed.
     - **Base-Level Factor (B4):** The construction started over a year ago or has been completed.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **(A1 denies R1)**: Because if the building violates the distance requirement, it directly impacts the owner's ability to demand changes.
   - **(A2 supports R1)**: Since the time frame and completion status are crucial in determining whether the neighboring landowner can only claim damages.
   - **(B1 supports A1)**: Violating the distance rule substantiates the abstract factor of boundary considerations.
   - **(B2 denies A1)**: Adhering to or exceeding the distance requirement undermines the relevance of boundary issues.
   - **(B3 denies A2)**: Being within the first year of construction without completion denies the condition for only claiming damages.
   - **(B4 supports A2)**: Exceeding one year from the start of construction or completing the building supports the condition for the neighboring landowner to only claim damages.

Given the query, "Assuming there is a need to maintain a distance of 50 centimeters or more from the boundary line when building a building, after a year lapses from the time when such construction started, or if that building has been completed, the owner of the adjacent land may not demand changes to the building and may only claim damages," let's analyze:

- **(query entails B4)**: The query specifically mentions scenarios where either more than a year has passed since construction began or the building is completed, aligning with Base-Level Factor B4.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query states that after a year lapses from the start of construction or upon completion of the building, the owner may not demand changes but can only claim damages, which directly agrees with Root Node R1.

Upon reevaluation, considering the structure and the analysis provided:
- The query indeed aligns with the conditions described in **B4**, focusing on the timeframe and completion status.
- It also aligns perfectly with the outcome stated in **R1**, concerning the limitation of remedies to damages after a certain period or upon building completion.

Thus, the justified conclusion remains consistent: 
**(query entails B4)** and **(query agree R1)**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on Article 209, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

1. **Root Node (R)**: The legal conclusion or verdict that Article 209 seeks to establish is that an owner of land may request the use of neighboring land for specific purposes under certain conditions.

   - **R1**: An owner of land can request the use of neighboring land for constructing or repairing walls or buildings on or in the vicinity of the boundary.

2. **Abstract Factors (A)**: The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include the necessity of the use, the extent of the use, and the conditions under which such use is allowed (e.g., not entering a dwelling house without approval).

   - **A1**: The request for use must be to the extent necessary for the construction or repair.
   - **A2**: The owner may not enter the dwelling house of the neighbor without approval.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B)**, if applicable:

   Since **A1** and **A2** can be considered as directly applying to specific conditions without needing further refinement for this particular article, we do not refine them further into base-level factors in this context. However, for the sake of illustrating how one might approach refining abstract factors, let's consider a hypothetical refinement:

   - **B1** (under **A1**): The necessity is determined by the impossibility to construct or repair without accessing the neighboring land.
   - **B2** (under **A2**): Approval for entering a dwelling house must be obtained from the neighbor before entry.

4. **Establish Directed Links**:

   Given our direct abstract factors, we establish links as follows:
   
   - (**A1 supports R1**): The necessity and extent of use support the conclusion that an owner can request neighboring land use.
   - (**A2 supports R1**): The condition of not entering a dwelling house without approval also supports this conclusion by setting boundaries to the request.

Now, addressing the query: "If an owner of one part of neighboring land repairs a building on the owned land, then he/she may request the use of the neighboring land to the extent necessary for repairing the building from his/her neighbor, however he/she may not enter the dwelling house of the neighbor without the approval of the same."

- **Justification**: The query entails **B1** because it considers a scenario where the owner needs to access neighboring land for repair, implying necessity.
  
  - (**query entails B1**)
  
- **Agreement with Root Node (R)**: The query agrees with **R1** because both state that an owner can request use of neighboring land under specific conditions (necessity and approval for entering a dwelling).

  - (**query agree R1**)

After careful reconsideration, the analysis stands as the query directly aligns with the principles outlined in Article 209 regarding the use of neighboring land for repairs and the conditions thereof. 

Therefore, the output is:
- (**query entails B1**)
- (**query agree R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 213 is to establish that if the partition of land creates a parcel with no access to public roads, the owner may pass through lands owned by another person who participated in the partition, upon paying compensation.

- **Root Node (R1):** An owner of land without direct access to public roads due to partition or transfer may use adjacent lands for passage upon compensation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that validate this conclusion include:
- The necessity of accessing public roads.
- The participation in the partition or transfer of land.
- The requirement of paying compensation for using someone else's land for passage.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Necessity of Access to Public Roads
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Participation in Land Partition or Transfer
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Requirement of Compensation

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining the abstract factors, we have:
- Under A1 (Necessity of Access to Public Roads):
  - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Landlocked parcel due to partition.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Lack of direct access to public roads after land transfer.
- Under A2 (Participation in Land Partition or Transfer):
  - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Participation in the original partition creating the landlocked situation.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B4):** Involvement in the transfer of part of the land.
- Under A3 (Requirement of Compensation):
  - **Base-Level Factor (B5):** Payment for right-of-way through adjacent lands.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(B3 supports A2)**
- **(B4 supports A2)**
- **(B5 supports A3)**

Given the query: "In cases where person A, who owns land L, subdivides the land into land M, which is surrounded by other land and has no access to public roads, and land N, which is not so, then sells land M to person B, person B has the right-of-way to reach public roads only regarding land N."

Justifying whether the query entails base-level factors:
- The scenario described involves a partition creating a landlocked parcel (land M), which aligns with **Base-Level Factor (B1)**. Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.

Justifying whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root node (R1):
- The query suggests that person B has the right-of-way to reach public roads through adjacent lands due to the partition and sale of land M, which aligns with the conclusion established by Article 213. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After rejustification:
The initial analysis correctly identifies that the query entails a situation where a base-level factor (B1) is applicable due to the creation of a landlocked parcel through subdivision and sale. It also accurately concludes that the scenario described in the query aligns with the legal conclusion established by Article 213, as it involves accessing public roads through adjacent lands after partition or transfer, thereby supporting the root node R1.

Therefore, the final justification confirms:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

correct prediction case 10
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict established by the article. In this case, it can be stated as:
- **R1**: A possessor of a thing belonging to another person has the right to retain that thing until their claim related to it is satisfied.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion.
- **A1**: The possession of the thing by the claimant is lawful and not commenced by a tortious act.
- **A2**: The claim of the possessor has arisen in relation to the thing being possessed.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining abstract factors into more specific conditions.
- **B1** (refines A1): Possession commenced lawfully without a tortious act.
- **B2** (refines A2): The claim has fallen due.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Each factor must either support or deny the occurrence of the root legal determination or another abstract factor.
- (**B1 supports A1**)
- (**B2 supports A2**)
- (**A1 supports R1**)
- (**A2 supports R1**)

Given the query: "A right of retention is not established if the obligee with a secured claim does not possess the subject matter, and even if he/she temporarily has possession, the right shall not be established in cases where the possession commenced by means of a tortious act."

### Justification:
- The query directly mentions conditions under which the right of retention is not established. Specifically, it talks about the necessity of lawful possession for the right to exist.
- (**query entails B1**), because both consider the scenario where possession's commencement affects the establishment of the right of retention.

Considering **R1**, the root node, and comparing it with the query:
- The query essentially outlines scenarios where **R1** does not apply (e.g., lack of possession or possession commenced by a tortious act). Therefore, in those specific scenarios, the query and **R1** are considering different verdicts based on the conditions.
- (**query disagree R1**), because the query specifies situations under which the right of retention is not established, directly opposing the general statement of **R1** when those conditions (e.g., tortious act) are met.

Rejustifying the answer:
Upon reevaluation, it's clear that while **B1** and the query align in their consideration of lawful possession as a critical factor for the right of retention, the disagreement with **R1** hinges on the specific scenarios outlined by the query. These scenarios highlight exceptions to the general rule stated by **R1**, thus confirming the initial assessment.

Therefore, the final justification remains:
- (**query entails B1**)
- (**query disagree R1**)

wrong prediction case 11
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 295 seeks to establish the conditions under which a possessor of a thing belonging to another person can retain that thing until their claim is satisfied. Thus, the root node (R1) can be determined as:
- R1: A right of retention for a possessor exists.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- A1: The claim has arisen in relation to the thing possessed.
- A2: The possession commenced lawfully.
- A3: The relevant claim has fallen due.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- B1 (under A1): The claim is directly related to the maintenance or improvement of the possessed thing.
- B2 (under A2): Possession was obtained through a lawful act or agreement.
- B3 (under A3): The due date for the claim has passed.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are established as follows:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (B3 supports A3)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)
- (A3 supports R1)

Given the query: "A right of retention is not established when a secured claim has not yet fallen due."

### Justification
The query directly pertains to the condition under which a right of retention does not apply, specifically focusing on the timing of the claim's due date. This scenario aligns with Base-Level Factor B3 (under A3), which discusses the claim having fallen due as a prerequisite for the right of retention.

Thus, we can say: **(query entails B3)**

Regarding agreement or disagreement with the Root Node R1:
- The query essentially states that if the secured claim has not yet fallen due, the right of retention is not established. This directly aligns with the conditions outlined in Article 295 and the constructed ANGELIC structure, particularly with A3 (the relevant claim has fallen due) supporting R1.
- However, the query's statement about a condition under which the right of retention does not apply (claim not yet due) actually supports the logic behind R1 by outlining one of its necessary conditions (i.e., for retention to be valid, claims must have fallen due).

Therefore, considering the most comparable scenario and focusing on the logical structure provided: **(query agree R1)**

After rejustification, this conclusion remains consistent with the analysis based on the provided legal provisions and the query's context.

correct prediction case 12
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 297 seeks to establish that a holder of a right of retention may collect fruits derived from the thing retained and appropriate them to the satisfaction of their own claim before other obligees. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A holder of a right of retention has priority over others in appropriating fruits derived from the retained subject matter for their claim.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The existence of a valid right of retention.
- **A2**: The ability to collect and appropriate fruits from the retained thing.
These abstract factors validate the root node's conclusion by establishing the conditions under which a holder can exercise their right of retention.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, we have:
- **B1**: The subject matter is in the possession of the holder due to a legitimate reason allowing for the right of retention.
- **B2**: There exists a valid claim by the holder against the owner of the subject matter.

For **A2**:
- **B3**: The fruits derived from the retained thing are identifiable and can be separated from other assets.
- **B4**: The law permits the appropriation of such fruits for debt satisfaction, prioritizing the holder's claim over others.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1** supports **A1**), (**B2** supports **A1**): Both possession and a valid claim support the existence of a right of retention.
- (**B3** supports **A2**), (**B4** supports **A2**): Identifiable fruits and legal permission to appropriate them for debt satisfaction support the ability to collect and appropriate fruits.
- (**A1** supports **R1**), (**A2** supports **R1**): The existence of a valid right of retention and the ability to collect and appropriate fruits support the root node's conclusion.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "A holder of a right of retention may not accept priority performance from the subject matter, but may accept priority performance from fruits that derived from the subject matter."

- **Query entails B3**: The query considers the scenario where fruits are derived from the subject matter and can be used for priority performance, which aligns with base-level factor **B3** about identifiable fruits.
  
- To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with the root node **R1**, we examine if the query's statement supports or contradicts **R1**. The query specifies that a holder cannot accept priority performance directly from the subject matter but can do so from its fruits, which seems to partially support **R1** by acknowledging priority in certain conditions (fruits derived) while introducing a distinction (not directly from the subject matter).

Therefore, considering the most comparable scenario:
- (**query entails B3**)
- Since the query does acknowledge a form of priority for the holder of the right of retention under specific conditions (from fruits), it can be seen as agreeing with **R1** in principle but with specific caveats not directly addressed by **R1**. However, given the structure and focusing strictly on the agreement regarding priority from fruits:
- (**query agree R1**) 

Upon rejustification, considering the query's focus on the distinction between accepting performance from the subject matter itself versus its fruits, it highlights a nuanced understanding that is partially aligned with but also introduces conditions not directly covered by **R1**. The core of **R1**, however, pertains to priority from fruits, which the query does not dispute but rather clarifies under what specific circumstances (fruits, not subject matter) such priority can be accepted. Thus, the initial interpretation stands as the most accurate reflection of the relationship between the query and **R1** within the context provided.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and address the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 313 is to establish that a statutory lien exists for a lessor against certain movables under specific conditions. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- R1: The statutory lien of a lessor exists against specified movables.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- A1: The lessor is of land.
- A2: The movables are furnished to the land, buildings for the use of that land, or are fruits of that land in the possession of the lessee.
- A3: The lessor is of a building.
- A4: The movables are furnished to the building by the lessee.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Further refining these factors, we get:
- B1: The land includes buildings for its use.
- B2: Movables provided include fruits of the land.
- B3: Buildings are specifically mentioned as having a lessor with lien rights against movables furnished by the lessee.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Given that each factor must have one and only one directed link:
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1
- A3 supports R1
- A4 supports R1
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root
The query "The statutory lien of a lessor of a building shall exist with movables furnished to that building by the lessee" directly relates to the conditions outlined in Article 313, particularly focusing on the aspect of a lessor of a building having a statutory lien against movables furnished to that building.

Given this context:
- The query entails B3 because it specifically considers the scenario where the lessor is of a building and the movables are furnished by the lessee.
- Since B3 supports A3, and A3 supports R1, and considering that the query essentially states a condition under which a statutory lien exists (which aligns with the conditions outlined for R1), we can conclude that the query agrees with R1.

Therefore:
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

After re-justification, these conclusions hold as they accurately reflect the relationship between the query and the constructed legal framework based on Article 313.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break down the information provided and apply it step by step to construct the ANGELIC structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article discusses the conditions under which a statutory lien can be exercised, particularly concerning monies received as compensation for the subject matter of the lien. The root node (R1) can be defined as:
- R1: A statutory lien can be exercised against monies or things that the obligor is to receive due to the sale, lease, loss, or damage of the subject matter.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. Based on the article:
- A1: The existence of a statutory lien on the subject matter.
- A2: The requirement for the holder of the statutory lien to attach the monies or things before payment or delivery.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors:
- B1 (under A1): The statutory lien is valid and properly established.
- B2 (under A2): The holder of the statutory lien has taken the necessary steps to attach the monies or things before they are paid or delivered.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- (B1 supports A1) because a valid statutory lien is necessary for its exercise.
- (B2 supports A2) since attaching the monies or things before payment is required for exercising the lien.
- (A1 supports R1) as having a statutory lien on the subject matter directly supports the conclusion that it can be exercised against compensations.
- (A2 supports R1) because following the procedural requirement of attachment is necessary for the exercise of the lien.

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation
Follows the criteria:
- Root Node: R1
- Abstract Factors: A1, A2
- Base-Level Factors: B1, B2

### Justification of Query Entailment
The query mentions an obligee exercising a general statutory lien concerning money received in payment as compensation for the thing owned. This scenario aligns with the conditions described by base-level factor B1 (valid statutory lien) and the procedural aspect of A2 (attachment requirement), which suggests that:
- (query entails B1)

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node
The query essentially asks if an obligee can exercise a statutory lien on money received as compensation, which aligns with the conditions under which a statutory lien can be exercised as defined by R1. Therefore:
- (query agree R1)

After rejustification, considering the details of the article and the query's focus on exercising a statutory lien against compensations for the subject matter, it's clear that both the entailment of B1 and the agreement with R1 are appropriate conclusions based on the provided legal context. 

Thus, the final output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 15
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided article and query, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 343 is that a thing which cannot be transferred to another person may not be made the subject of a pledge.
   - Therefore, the Root Node can be stated as: "A pledge cannot be created over a non-transferable thing."
   - Labeling it as R1.

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factor here is the transferability of a thing, which substantiates or undermines the creation of a pledge.
   - Therefore, we have an abstract factor: "Transferability of a Thing" labeled as A1.
   
3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - The abstract factor "Transferability of a Thing" can be refined into specific scenarios or conditions that affect transferability, such as legal restrictions, physical impossibility, etc.
   - For simplicity and based on the given information, let's consider a base-level factor related to legal restrictions: "Legal Restrictions Preventing Transfer" labeled as B1.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - The abstract factor A1 (Transferability of a Thing) supports R1 (A pledge cannot be created over a non-transferable thing), because if something can be transferred, it implies that it could potentially be pledged.
   - The base-level factor B1 (Legal Restrictions Preventing Transfer) denies A1 (Transferability of a Thing), because legal restrictions would prevent the transfer and thus impact the possibility of creating a pledge.

Given the ANGELIC structure criteria:
- **Root Node**: R1 - "A pledge cannot be created over a non-transferable thing."
- **Abstract Factor**: A1 - "Transferability of a Thing"
- **Base-Level Factor**: B1 - "Legal Restrictions Preventing Transfer"

Directed links:
- (B1 denies A1)
- (A1 supports R1)

Now, considering the query: "Pledges cannot be created over a Thing that cannot be assigned to others."
- This query directly relates to the scenario where something is non-transferable (or cannot be assigned), which aligns with the base-level factor B1's context of things being non-transferable due to certain restrictions or conditions.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)** because both are concerned with situations where a thing cannot be transferred or assigned to others.

The query also agrees with the root node R1, as it states that pledges cannot be created over such non-transferable things, which is exactly what R1 concludes.
- Thus, **(query agree R1)**.

Upon reevaluation:
- The conclusion remains consistent. The query's scenario aligns perfectly with the conditions described by B1 and supports the outcome stated in R1, affirming that pledges cannot be created over non-transferable things.

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 16
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 344 is that the creation of a pledge becomes effective through delivery of the subject matter of the pledge to the obligee. This can be stated as:
- R1: The creation of a pledge is effective upon delivery of the subject matter to the obligee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: Delivery of the subject matter is a necessary condition for the effectiveness of a pledge.
- A2: The nature of the property (movable or immovable) may influence how the delivery affects the pledge's creation.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and considering different scenarios:
- B1: For movables, physical transfer is a common method of delivery.
- B2: For immovables or specific types of properties, delivery may involve a summary transfer or transfer of possession by instruction.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (B1 supports A1) because physical transfer is a direct way to deliver movables.
- (B2 supports A1) since it provides an alternative method for delivering immovables or specific properties, thus supporting the necessity of delivery for pledge creation.
- (A1 supports R1) as it directly contributes to the effectiveness of a pledge upon delivery.
- (A2 denies R1) if it implies that different types of properties might not require delivery in the same manner, potentially complicating the straightforward application of R1.

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation
Root Node: R1 - The creation of a pledge is effective upon delivery of the subject matter to the obligee.
Abstract Factors:
- A1: Delivery is necessary for effectiveness.
- A2: Property type influences delivery method.
Base-Level Factors:
- B1: Physical transfer for movables.
- B2: Summary or instructional transfer for immovables.

### Justification
Given the query, "A pledge creation contract that has immovable properties or movables as its objective shall take effect by delivering the subject matter, but this transfer may be either a summary transfer or a transfer of possession by instruction," we analyze:
- The query directly mentions methods applicable to both movables and immovables (summary transfer or transfer of possession by instruction), which aligns with B2's consideration for alternative delivery methods.
- Therefore, (query entails B2).
  
Considering the agreement with the root node R1, which states that the creation of a pledge is effective upon delivery:
- The query supports this notion by stating that delivering the subject matter (regardless of the method) makes the pledge creation contract take effect. Hence, it aligns with the principle that delivery is crucial for the effectiveness of a pledge.
- Therefore, (query agree R1).

After rejustification, considering all aspects and links:
- The conclusion remains consistent: the query supports the base-level factor concerning alternative methods of delivery (B2) and agrees with the root node's stance on the effectiveness of pledge creation through delivery (R1). 

Output:
(query entails B2)
(query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 17
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 349 is that the pledgor may not allow the pledgee to acquire ownership of the thing pledged as satisfaction of the obligations, either by acts establishing pledges or by contracts made prior to the due dates for the obligations. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A pledgor cannot agree to let a pledgee acquire the pledged item in satisfaction of obligations.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Legal prohibition on agreements allowing pledgees to acquire ownership of pledged items before due dates.
- **A2**: The principle that pledges must be disposed of according to legal prescriptions, not by private agreement.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: Contracts made before the due dates cannot include provisions for the pledgee to acquire the pledged item.
- Under **A2**, we have:
  - **B2**: Any disposal of the pledged item must follow legal procedures, not agreements between parties.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are as follows:
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Because contracts before due dates cannot include such provisions, it supports the abstract factor of legal prohibition.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): Following legal procedures for disposing of pledged items supports the principle that pledges must be handled according to law.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): The legal prohibition on certain agreements directly supports the root conclusion about what a pledgor cannot do.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): The requirement for legal disposal procedures also supports the root conclusion.

Given the query: "A pledgee and a pledgor may not agree to the pledgee's acquisition of the Thing pledged as performance for obligations, even after the due dates for performance of his/her obligations secured by the pledge."

Justifying whether the query entails base-level factors:
- The query discusses agreements about acquiring the pledged item in satisfaction of obligations, which aligns with **B1**'s scenario but specifically mentions "even after the due dates." This suggests it's considering a scenario similar to but slightly broader than **B1**, as **B1** focuses on before due dates. However, the principle behind the query and **B1** is similar in spirit regarding restrictions on agreements for acquiring pledged items.

Justifying whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root node:
- The query states that a pledgee and pledgor may not agree to the pledgee's acquisition of the thing pledged as performance for obligations, even after due dates. This directly aligns with **R1**'s conclusion that a pledgor cannot agree to let a pledgee acquire the pledged item in satisfaction of obligations. The query essentially extends or reaffirms this principle beyond the specific timing (before due dates) mentioned in the article.

Therefore:
- (**query entails B1**), considering the evidence is about restrictions on agreements for acquiring pledged items, although the query specifies "even after the due dates."
- (**query agree R1**), as both conclude that a pledgor cannot agree to such acquisitions, with the query applying this principle beyond the initial timing specified in the article. 

Rejustifying:
Upon reevaluation, it's clear that while **B1** specifically addresses contracts before due dates, the query's extension to "even after" due dates still falls under the broader legal principle against allowing pledgees to acquire pledged items through private agreements rather than legal procedures. Thus, the agreement with **R1** is confirmed, as both assert a prohibition on such agreements. The entailment of **B1** might be seen as less direct due to the timing difference (before vs. after due dates), but the query's core aligns with the spirit of restrictions on pledgee acquisitions outlined in **R1** and supported by factors like **A1** and **B1**.

Thus, after careful consideration:
- The query does indeed entail a base-level factor similar to **B1**, given its focus on restrictions against acquiring pledged items through agreements.
- Most importantly, the query agrees with **R1**, as both assert a prohibition against pledgors agreeing to let pledgees acquire pledged items in satisfaction of obligations.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then justify whether the query entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if a building and land belong to the same owner, and after a mortgage is enforced resulting in different owners for the land and the building, it is deemed that a superficies has been created with respect to that building. Thus, the root node can be identified as:
- R1: Creation of statutory superficies when enforcement of a mortgage on jointly owned land and building results in separate ownership.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors substantiating this conclusion include:
- A1: The initial joint ownership of the land and the building by the same person.
- A2: The creation of a joint mortgage with respect to both the land and the building for another party.
- A3: The enforcement of the mortgage leading to a change in ownership, specifically resulting in different owners for the land and the building.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- B1 (under A1): The original owner of both the land and the building is the same person.
- B2 (under A2): A mortgage is created that jointly covers both the land and the building for a different party.
- B3 (under A3): The execution of the mortgage results in the land being owned by a new party, while the building remains with or is transferred to another owner.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Given the nature of the factors:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1
- A3 supports R1

The query discusses a scenario where a building owned by person A is built on land also owned by person A. A joint mortgage is created for person B with respect to both the building and the land. After the execution of the mortgage, only the land's ownership changes to person C. This scenario aims to determine if statutory superficies will be established regarding the building on the land.

### Justification
- The query entails B1 because it considers a situation where initially, the same person owns both the land and the building.
- The query entails B2 as it involves the creation of a joint mortgage for another party with respect to both the land and the building.
- The query entails B3 since it discusses the outcome of the mortgage's execution, resulting in a change of ownership for the land but not explicitly stating the building's fate, implying different owners for the land and potentially the building.

Given these entailments, we examine if the query agrees or disagrees with R1:
- The query presents a scenario where all conditions for the creation of statutory superficies as per Article 388 are met: initial joint ownership, joint mortgage, and enforcement leading to separate ownership. Therefore, (query agree R1).

After rejustification, considering the details provided in the query align closely with the conditions outlined in Article 388 for the establishment of statutory superficies due to the enforcement of a mortgage resulting in different owners for the land and building, the conclusion remains consistent.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 19
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article seeks to establish that a guarantee obligation includes not just the principal amount but also interest, penalty, compensation for loss or damage, and all other charges secondary to the principal obligation. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: A guarantor's obligation encompasses both the principal debt and secondary liabilities.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: The scope of guarantee obligations as defined by law.
- A2: The interpretation of contractual terms regarding what is covered under a guarantee.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- B1 (under A1): Specific legal provisions (like Article 447) that explicitly state what is included in a guarantee obligation.
- B2 (under A2): The principle that a guarantor may stipulate the amount of penalty or compensation for loss or damage with regard to their own guarantee obligation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links

- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)

Given the query: "Assuming that a recovery obligation due to cancellation is understood as a different obligation that is not identical to the original obligation, whenever it is considered whether or not the recovery obligation due to contract cancellation being included in the scope of the guarantee obligation is a problem in the interpretation of intention of the party in the guarantee contract, the guarantor for the seller in a sales contract for specified Thing may be understood to bear responsibility for the guarantee even for the recovery obligation in cases where the contract is cancelled due to default by the seller."

### Justification

The query essentially discusses whether a guarantor's obligation extends to recovery obligations arising from contract cancellations. This scenario aligns with considering the scope of guarantee obligations and the interpretation of contractual terms, which are addressed by B1 and A2.

- (query entails B1) because both consider specific legal provisions regarding what is included in a guarantee obligation.
  
Considering the root node R1, which states that a guarantor's obligation encompasses both the principal debt and secondary liabilities, and comparing it with the query:

- The query seems to agree with R1 by suggesting that a guarantor may bear responsibility for recovery obligations (a form of secondary liability) due to contract cancellations.

Therefore:
- (query agrees R1)

After re-justification, considering the nuances of legal interpretation and the specific focus on guarantee obligations including secondary liabilities like penalties or compensation for loss or damage, the conclusion holds:

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that even after the obligee has made a demand to the principal obligor, the obligee must first execute on the property of the principal obligor if certain conditions are met by the guarantor. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: The obligee must execute on the property of the principal obligor before considering the guarantor's liability, under specific conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- A1: The principal obligor has the financial resources to pay the obligation.
- A2: The execution on the principal obligor's property can be easily performed.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For A1 and A2, we can refine them as follows:
- B1 (supports A1): The principal obligor has sufficient assets to cover the obligation.
- B2 (supports A1): The principal obligor's financial records indicate a capacity to pay debts.
- B3 (supports A2): There are no significant legal barriers to executing on the principal obligor's property.
- B4 (supports A2): The principal obligor's property is easily accessible for execution.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A1
- B3 supports A2
- B4 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Given the query: "In order for a guarantor to exercise the right of defense of obligor's solvency, he/she must prove that the principal obligor has the financial resources to pay his/her obligation and that the execution would be easily performed."

Justification:
- The query entails B1 because both consider the scenario where the principal obligor has sufficient means (financial resources) to pay the obligation.
- The query entails B3 because it also discusses the ease of executing on the property, which aligns with the concept of no significant legal barriers to execution.

Considering the most comparable root node R1 and the query's statement:
- The query agrees with R1 in that both assert the necessity of the obligee to first execute on the principal obligor's property if the guarantor can prove the principal obligor's solvency and the ease of execution. This aligns with the conditions under which the obligee must prioritize executing on the principal obligor's assets.

Therefore, based on the constructed ANGELIC structure and the given query:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 21
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 457 seeks to establish that a guarantor may assert against the obligee defenses and rights that can be raised by the principal obligor, including setting off claims. Therefore, the root node is:
- **R1**: A guarantor has the right to raise defenses and set off claims on behalf of the principal obligor against the obligee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The existence of a valid guarantee agreement.
- **A2**: The rights and defenses available to the principal obligor.
- **A3**: The principle of accessory liability in guarantees.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2 into base-level factors gives us:
- **B1**: The right of set-off against the obligee.
- **B2**: The defense of prescription or limitation period.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**A1 supports R1**): Because a valid guarantee agreement is necessary for the guarantor's rights to be considered.
- (**A2 supports R1**): Since the rights and defenses available to the principal obligor directly impact what the guarantor can assert against the obligee.
- (**B1 supports A2**): As the right of set-off is a specific defense or right that can be exercised by the principal obligor, thus also by the guarantor.
- (**B2 supports A2**): The defense of prescription or limitation period being another right that can be raised.

### Query Analysis
Given the query regarding the provision in the Civil Code about a guarantor's ability to set off any claim which the principal obligor may have against the obligee, we see that:
- (**Query entails B1**), because both consider the scenario where the guarantor has the right to set off claims on behalf of the principal obligor.
- (**Query agree R1**), since the query and R1 concur that a guarantor can raise defenses and set off claims against the obligee, reflecting an agreement in the comparable situation.

After careful consideration and re-justification, it's clear that the analysis correctly reflects the relationships between the query, base-level factors, and the root node based on the provided legal provisions. 

Therefore:
- (Query entails B1)
- (Query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 22
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 459 seeks to establish that a guarantor has a right to reimbursement from the principal obligor for the amount of property expended when the guarantor performs an obligation on behalf of the principal obligor or takes any other act intended to cause the obligation to be extinguished in exchange for their own property.

- **R1**: A guarantor has a right to reimbursement from the principal obligor under specific conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- The guarantor giving a guarantee as requested by the principal obligor.
- The guarantor performing the obligation on behalf of the principal obligor or taking another act intended to cause the obligation to be extinguished in exchange for their own property.
- The absence of negligence on the part of the guarantor.

- **A1**: Guarantee given at the request of the principal obligor.
- **A2**: Performance of obligation or act for extinguishment by the guarantor.
- **A3**: Absence of negligence by the guarantor.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1, A2, and A3 into more specific conditions:

- Under **A1**:
  - **B1**: The guarantor provided a guarantee upon the request of the principal obligor.
  
- Under **A2**:
  - **B2**: The guarantor performed the obligation to the obligee as ordered by a judgment.
  - **B3**: The guarantor performed the obligation on behalf of the principal obligor without a court order but in good faith.
  - **B4**: The guarantor took another act intended to cause the obligation to be extinguished, such as paying off the debt directly.

- Under **A3**:
  - **B5**: The guarantor was not negligent at any point during the process of giving the guarantee or performing the obligation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Each abstract factor supports the root node R1, and each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor:

- **A1** supports **R1**: The fact that a guarantor gave a guarantee at the request of the principal obligor supports their right to reimbursement.
- **A2** supports **R1**: Performing an obligation or act for extinguishment in exchange for one's own property supports the guarantor's claim for reimbursement.
- **A3** supports **R1**: The absence of negligence on the part of the guarantor is crucial for claiming reimbursement.

- **B1** supports **A1**, **B2** and **B3** support **A2**, **B4** supports **A2**, and **B5** supports **A3**.

### Query Analysis:
Given the query, "In cases where a guarantor has given a guarantee as entrusted by the principal obligor, if he/she had a judgment ordering him/her to perform the obligation to the obligee, or has performed the obligation on behalf of the principal obligor, or has otherwise in exchange for his/her own property performed any other act intended to cause the obligation to be extinguished, as long as the guarantor has not been negligent at any time whatsoever, that guarantor has a right to indemnification against the principal debtor."

- The query entails **B2** because it mentions having a judgment ordering the performance of the obligation.
- The query also aligns with **B5** since it specifies that the guarantor has not been negligent.

Considering these points:

- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B5)

Given that both B2 and B5 support their respective abstract factors, which in turn support R1, the query essentially agrees with the root node's verdict that a guarantor under specific conditions has a right to reimbursement from the principal obligor.

Therefore:
- (query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 23
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 467 seeks to establish that for an assignment of a claim to be duly asserted against the obligor or any other third party, notice must be given to the obligor or the obligor must have consented to the assignment. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The assignment of a claim is duly asserted against the obligor or any third party if notice is given or consent is obtained.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Notice given to the obligor.
- **A2**: Consent from the obligor.
- **A3**: The method of notice or consent affecting third-party awareness.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1**:
  - **B1**: Notice is given using an instrument with a certified date.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B2**: Obligor's explicit consent to the assignment.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B3**: The notice or consent method does not affect its validity against third parties if it lacks a certified date.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are established as follows:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Having a certified date on the notice supports the validity of the notice given to the obligor.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Explicit consent from the obligor supports the assignment's validity.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Giving notice to the obligor supports the assertion of the claim assignment.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Obtaining consent from the obligor supports the assertion of the claim assignment.
- **(A3 denies R1)**: If the method of notice or consent does not adhere to required formalities (like lacking a certified date for third-party validity), it undermines the assertion against third parties.

### Justification
Given the query "If an obligor acknowledges assignment of a claim vis-a-vis either the assigner or the assignee, the assignee may raise the assignment as a defense against the obligor," we analyze its relation to the constructed structure:
- **(Query entails B2)**: The query implies that if the obligor acknowledges (which can be seen as a form of consent) the assignment, then this scenario aligns with base-level factor **B2**, where explicit consent from the obligor is given.
- **(Query agrees R1)**: The query's conclusion that the assignee may raise the assignment as a defense against the obligor after acknowledgment (a form of consent or notice) agrees with the root node **R1**. Both suggest that under certain conditions (notice or consent), the assignment can be duly asserted against the obligor.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of legal interpretation and the specific wording of both the query and the article:
- The acknowledgment by the obligor directly supports the idea that the assignee has a valid defense, which aligns with **R1**'s requirement for notice or consent.
- The scenario presented in the query indeed considers a base-level factor akin to **B2**, as it deals with the obligor's awareness and agreement (consent) to the assignment.

Therefore, the final assessment is:
- **(Query entails B2)**
- **(Query agrees R1)**

correct prediction case 24
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the information step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node should determine the outcome or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 468 and the query, we can identify a root node as follows:
- **R1:** An obligor may assert against the assignee any event that has taken place with regard to the assignor by the time of completion of the perfection.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion.
- **A1:** The timing of the completion of the perfection affects the obligor's ability to assert events against the assignee.
- **A2:** The nature of the assignment and any acknowledgments given by the obligor can impact their obligations towards the assignee.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining abstract factors into more specific base-level factors based on the provided information.
- **B1** (under A1): The event occurred before the completion of the perfection, which directly impacts the obligor's ability to assert against the assignee.
- **B2** (under A2): An obligor who has given an acknowledgment without objection to the assignor may not refuse performance to the assignee but can demand return of payment from the assignor.

### 4. Establish Directed Links:
Each factor should have a directed link indicating whether it supports or denies another factor.
- **(B1 supports A1):** The occurrence of an event before perfection directly relates to the timing aspect, supporting A1.
- **(B2 supports A2):** The specifics of acknowledgments and their impact on obligations support the abstract notion in A2 regarding assignment nature and its effects.
- **(A1 supports R1):** Understanding the timing of events as they pertain to perfection completion is crucial for determining what can be asserted against an assignee, supporting R1.
- **(A2 supports R1):** Recognizing how assignments and acknowledgments affect obligations also supports the root conclusion about asserting events against assignees.

### Query Analysis:
Given the query: "If an obligor has given an acknowledgement without objection to the assignor of a claim, even if the claim was satisfied, he/she may not refuse the performance of the obligation vis-a-vis the assignee, but may demand the return of the payment money vis-a-vis the assignor."

- **(query entails B2):** The query directly aligns with the scenario described in B2, focusing on the implications of an obligor's acknowledgment without objection to the assignor.
  
### Agreement with Root Node:
Considering R1 and its relevance to asserting events against assignees based on the timing and nature of assignments, the query indirectly supports the concept that specific conditions (like acknowledgments) can affect an obligor's ability to assert certain rights or obligations against an assignee.

- **(query agree R1):** The query does not directly contradict but rather specifies a scenario under which an obligor may assert certain rights (demanding return of payment from the assignor), thereby agreeing with the general premise of R1 that the nature and timing of events can affect what is asserted against an assignee.

After careful consideration, this analysis holds as it correctly applies the provided framework to construct a logical legal argument based on the given articles and query.

wrong prediction case 25
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this framework, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome or legal conclusion that these articles seek to establish can be summarized as follows: 
- Performance made to a person not authorized to accept it may still be effective under certain conditions.
- The effectiveness of such performance is contingent upon specific criteria being met, such as good faith and non-negligence on the part of the performer.

Thus, we have two potential Root Nodes (R1 and R2) based on Articles 478 and 479:
- **R1**: Performance to an unauthorized person can be effective if done in good faith and without negligence.
- **R2**: Performance made to a person other than the one with the right to performance is only effective to the extent it enriches the obligee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

For R1:
- **A1**: Good faith on the part of the performer.
- **A2**: Absence of negligence by the performer.

For R2:
- **A3**: The performance enriches the obligee.
- **A4**: The person receiving the performance is not authorized to do so.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1 and A2 for more specificity:
- **B1**: The performer had no knowledge of the recipient's lack of authorization.
- **B2**: The performer took reasonable care to verify the recipient's identity or authority.

For A3, refining could involve:
- **B3**: The obligee directly benefits from the performance (e.g., receives payment).
- **B4**: The enrichment is indirect but still tangible (e.g., reduction in liability).

### 4. Establish Directed Links

For R1:
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)

For R2:
- (A3 supports R2)
- (A4 denies R2, in the context that performance to an unauthorized person is generally ineffective)
- (B3 supports A3)
- (B4 supports A3)

### Evaluation of Query

The query states: "Any performance vis-a-vis a person that has no authority to receive the payment has no effect vis-a-vis the creditor, except in cases where it has an effect as a payment vis-a-vis a holder of quasi-possession of the claim."

This query **entails B4** because both consider scenarios where the effectiveness of a performance is contingent upon specific conditions related to authorization and enrichment. However, B4 specifically talks about indirect but tangible enrichment, which isn't directly mentioned in the query.

Considering the context, the query seems more aligned with the conditions under which performance to an unauthorized person might still be effective (like in cases of quasi-possession), thus touching on the concepts around R1 and R2. 

However, **the query agrees with R2** because it emphasizes that performance to an unauthorized person generally has no effect on the creditor's rights, aligning with the idea that such performances are only effective if they enrich the obligee (as per Article 479).

Given this analysis:
- The final assessment is: **(query entails B4)** and **(query agrees R2)**.

Upon reevaluation for clarity and precision in the context of the provided instructions and legal framework, it's clear that the query directly pertains to the effectiveness of performances made to unauthorized parties, which is a central theme in both articles. Therefore, the conclusion stands as an accurate reflection of how the query interacts with the constructed legal framework.

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 487 seeks to establish that if there is an instrument evidencing a claim and the person making the performance has made full performance, that person may demand the return of the instrument.
- **Root Node (R1):** A person who has made full performance of a claim evidenced by an instrument may demand the return of the instrument.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Existence of an instrument evidencing a claim.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Completion of full performance by the person making the performance.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1) for A1:** The instrument is a valid evidence of the claim.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) for A1:** The claim is for wages or another form of debt.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3) for A2:** Payment has been made in full as per the agreement or contract.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1):** The validity of the instrument as evidence supports the existence of an instrument evidencing a claim.
- **(B2 supports A1):** The specific type of claim (e.g., for wages) supports the existence of an instrument evidencing a claim.
- **(B3 supports A2):** Full payment according to the agreement supports the completion of full performance.

### Justification
Given the query: "In cases where there is any instrument which evidences the claim for wages, the borrower may assert the fact that he/she will make a payment by returning and exchanging the instrument when attempting to make the performance has completed his/her entire performance."

- **(Query entails B1):** The query considers a scenario with an instrument evidencing a claim (specifically for wages), which aligns with Base-Level Factor B1.
- **(Query agrees R1):** The query implies that upon completing the payment (full performance), the borrower may return or exchange the instrument, which is in line with Root Node R1's conclusion that a person who has made full performance of a claim evidenced by an instrument may demand the return of the instrument.

Therefore, after careful justification and re-justification:
- The query directly relates to the conditions outlined in Base-Level Factor B1.
- The query aligns with the legal outcome or verdict presented in Root Node R1, as both concern the return of an instrument evidencing a claim upon full performance.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) should represent the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 481, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: An attaching obligee is entitled to request a third party obligor to perform the obligation de novo to the extent of the damage sustained by the attaching obligee if the third party obligor performs the obligation to their own obligee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion represented by the root node.
- **A1**: The performance of an obligation by a third party obligor to their own obligee despite an attachment.
- **A2**: The right of the attaching obligee to request performance de novo from the third party obligor.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific base-level factors:
- Under **A1**, a possible base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The third party obligor's payment to their own obligee was made despite being aware of the attachment.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: The extent of damage sustained by the attaching obligee due to the third party obligor's performance to their own obligee.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links connect factors in terms of support or denial relationships.
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Payment despite knowledge of attachment supports the condition for requesting de novo performance.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): The extent of damage is crucial for determining the right to request de novo performance.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Performance by the third party obligor to their own obligee supports the attaching obligee's entitlement to request de novo performance.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): The right to request de novo performance directly supports the root node's conclusion.

Given the query: "If a third party obligor who has been enjoined from making payment has paid his/her obligation to his/her own obligee, the relevant obligee shall not be entitled to request such third party obligor to make payment, even to the extent he/she suffered the damages."

### Justification
- The query entails **B1** because it considers a scenario where a third party obligor pays their obligation despite being enjoined (similar to being aware of an attachment), which is a specific situation that could fall under the abstract factor of performance despite legal impediments.
- However, upon closer examination, the query actually presents a scenario contrary to what **R1** establishes. The root node **R1** suggests that the attaching obligee can request de novo performance to the extent of their damage, whereas the query posits a situation where the obligee cannot request payment even if they suffered damages.

### Conclusion
- (query entails **B1**) because it discusses a specific scenario related to payment despite legal restrictions.
- (query disagree **R1**) because the query concludes that the relevant obligee shall not be entitled to request payment, contrary to what **R1** establishes regarding entitlement to de novo performance based on sustained damage.

After rejustification, considering the nuances of legal terminology and the specific conditions presented in both the article and the query, it's clear that the initial interpretation stands with a deeper understanding of how the query and the root node interact within the context of legal obligations and attachments.

correct prediction case 28
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 485 is to establish that unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the expenses of performance, those expenses are borne by the obligor. However, if the obligee causes these expenses to increase, the amount of this increase is borne by the obligee.

- **Root Node (R1):** The obligor bears the expenses of performance unless otherwise intended or increased by the obligee's actions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
- The manifestation of a particular intention regarding the expenses.
- The increase in expenses due to the obligee's actions.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Manifestation of a particular intention regarding the expenses of performance.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Increase in expenses caused by the obligee's relocation or other acts.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2, we get:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The obligee relocates their domicile, thereby increasing the expenses of performance.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The obligee takes other actions that increase the expenses of performance.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)** because if a particular intention is manifested, it directly influences who bears the expenses.
- **(A2 denies R1)** in cases where the obligee's actions cause an increase, as this changes who bears the increased expense.
- **(B1 supports A2)** since relocating domicile is an act that can increase expenses.
- **(B2 supports A2)** because other actions by the obligee can also lead to increased expenses.

Given the query: "Unless any other intention is manifested with respect to the expense of performance, such expenses shall be borne by the obligee, but in cases the relevant obligor caused the expense of performance to increase by relocating his/her domicile or taking any other actions, such incremental amount shall be borne by the obligor."

### Justification
- The query does not directly align with **B1** because it mentions the obligor causing the increase, not the obligee. However, it discusses a scenario where actions (relocation or others) cause an expense increase, which can be seen as related to **B2**, but with the roles reversed.
- Thus, considering the reversal of roles in responsibility for expenses based on who causes the increase, we could argue that **(query entails B2)** if we were strictly focusing on the action causing an increase. However, since the query flips the responsibility (obligor vs. obligee), it's more about the principle of increased expense due to actions rather than directly entailing B1 or B2 as written.
- The query fundamentally **disagrees** with **R1** because it suggests that unless a particular intention is manifested, expenses are borne by the obligee (not the obligor), and only the incremental amount caused by the obligor's actions is borne by the obligor.

### Conclusion
Given the structure and analysis:
- The query does not directly entail any base-level factor due to its role reversal but touches on principles similar to **B2** if focusing solely on the action causing an increase.
- It disagrees with the root node **R1** due to the difference in who bears the expenses by default and under what conditions.

Therefore, the justification is:
**(query disagree R1)**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if a claim extinguished by prescription was eligible for set-off prior to its extinguishment, the obligee may use that claim for the set-off. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A claim extinguished by prescription can still be used for set-off if it was eligible before extinguishment.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Eligibility of the claim for set-off before its extinguishment due to prescription.
- **A2**: The effect of prescription on the legal status of a claim, specifically regarding set-off.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2**:
- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The claim was legally valid and could be used for set-off before prescription occurred.
  - **B2**: The conditions under which a claim is considered eligible for set-off were met before the claim's extinguishment.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: Prescription leads to the complete extinguishment of a claim, potentially affecting its use in legal proceedings like set-off.
  - **B4**: There are exceptions or considerations that allow for the use of an extinguished claim under specific circumstances (e.g., set-off).

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **B1** supports **A1**
- **B2** supports **A1**
- **B3** denies **A2** in the context of allowing set-off after prescription.
- **B4** supports **A2**, as it provides a basis for using an extinguished claim in certain situations.

Given the query: "In cases where an active claim extinguished due to prescription, set-off may not be performed, but the adverse party may abandon the benefits of prescription and effect the set-off."

### Justification
The query entails **B4** because both consider scenarios where an extinguished claim might still be used in a legal context (set-off), albeit under specific conditions such as the abandonment of prescription benefits.

Regarding agreement with the root node (**R1**):
- The query seems to disagree with **R1** because it suggests that set-off may not be performed on an extinguished claim due to prescription, unless the benefits of prescription are abandoned. This implies a condition (abandonment of prescription benefits) under which an extinguished claim can be used for set-off, whereas **R1** states that if eligible before extinguishment, the claim can be used for set-off.

Therefore:
- (query entails B4)
- (query disagree R1)

After careful reconsideration, this justification holds because the query introduces a conditionality (abandonment of prescription benefits) not directly addressed by **R1**, which focuses on eligibility before extinguishment as the criterion for allowing set-off.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that gifts not in writing may be cancelled by either party under certain conditions. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: Gifts not in writing can be cancelled by either party.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The gift is not in writing.
- **A2**: Performance of the gift has been completed, at least in part.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A2**, we can refine it further because the condition of performance being completed affects the cancellability of the gift:
- **B1**: A portion of the gift's performance has been completed.
- **B2**: No performance of the gift has been completed.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **A1 supports R1**: The fact that a gift is not in writing directly supports the conclusion that it can be cancelled by either party.
- **A2 denies R1**: If a portion of the gift's performance has been completed, this undermines the ability to cancel the entire gift, thus denying **R1**.
- **B1 supports A2**: If a portion of the gift has been performed, this directly supports the condition that performance has been completed, at least in part.
- **B2 denies A2**: If no performance has occurred, this denies the condition that any part of the gift's performance has been completed.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "Either the donor or the donee may revoke gifts not in writing. However, that this shall not apply for any portion of the gift for which performance has been completed."
- The query essentially states the same principle as **R1** but with a condition similar to what **A2** and **B1** address.
- Thus, the query entails **B1**, because it considers a scenario where a portion of the gift's performance has been completed, making that part non-revocable.

### Agreement/Disagreement with Root Node
The query agrees with **R1** in principle but adds a specific condition regarding the completion of performance. However, since the core statement about gifts not in writing being revocable is maintained, and the exception mentioned aligns with the structure's factors (specifically supporting **A2** and thus indirectly denying **R1** under certain conditions), we can say the query agrees with **R1** in the general scenario where no performance has been completed but introduces a nuance that **R1** does not explicitly cover.

### Re-Justification
Upon re-evaluation, it's clear that the query directly addresses the revocability of gifts not in writing and introduces an exception based on performance completion. This aligns with both the root node's general statement and the abstract factor regarding performance completion. The introduction of **B1** as a base-level factor that the query entails is accurate because it specifies a condition (performance completion) under which revocation does not apply, directly supporting **A2**.

### Output
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

This analysis demonstrates how the ANGELIC structure can be applied to legal provisions to clarify and organize the relationships between different factors influencing a legal conclusion.

wrong prediction case 31
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article seeks to establish that a mandate becomes effective when a first party asks a second party to perform a juridical act, and the second party accepts this. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A mandate contract is effective upon acceptance by the second party.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the effectiveness of a mandate contract are:
- **A1**: The existence of an agreement between the parties.
- **A2**: The form of the agreement (oral vs. written).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining **A2** into base-level factors, we get:
- **B1**: Oral agreements are sufficient for the effectiveness of a mandate contract between parties.
- **B2**: Written documentation is necessary to assert the effect of a mandate contract to a third party.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Because an oral agreement can be considered as part of the acceptance process, supporting the existence of an agreement.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: Since written documentation can serve as evidence of the agreement, thereby supporting its existence for third-party assertions.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The existence of an agreement directly supports the effectiveness of a mandate contract upon acceptance.

### Justification:
Given the query "Since a mandate contract is a consensual contract, it shall be effective if there is an oral agreement. However, in order to assert the effect of a mandate contract to a third party, it must be documented in writing," we can justify as follows:

- **(query entails B1)**: The query considers oral agreements as sufficient for the effectiveness of a mandate contract between parties, aligning with base-level factor **B1**.
- **(query entails B2)**: It also acknowledges the necessity of written documentation to assert effects to a third party, which matches **B2**.

Considering the root node **R1**, the query essentially agrees that a mandate contract becomes effective upon acceptance but adds nuances regarding the form of agreement for internal (between parties) and external (to third parties) assertions. Therefore:
- **(query agree R1)**: The query fundamentally supports the verdict that a mandate contract is effective upon acceptance, with additional specifications on oral and written agreements.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics about oral agreements being sufficient for effectiveness but requiring written documentation for asserting effects to third parties, it's clear that the query aligns with **R1** while providing additional context. Thus, the initial justification stands:
- The query entails both **B1** and **B2**, reflecting nuances in agreement forms.
- The query agrees with **R1**, as it supports the effectiveness of a mandate contract upon acceptance, albeit with specifications on agreement forms.

Therefore, the justified conclusions are:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 176 and Article 177 combined seeks to establish that for a real right creation or transfer to be effective against third parties, it requires not only the manifestation of intention of the parties but also registration. However, focusing strictly on the effectiveness between parties:
- **Root Node (R1):** The creation and transfer of a real right become effective solely by the manifestations of intention of the parties.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion are:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Existence of an agreement between the parties.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Registration requirements for real rights on immovables.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Further refining these abstract factors, we get:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The presence of a written agreement is not required for the effectiveness of the creation and transfer between parties.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Registration is necessary for the real right to be asserted against third parties.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1)** because having an agreement, even without writing, can fulfill the manifestation of intention.
- **(A1 supports R1)** since the existence of an agreement directly contributes to the effectiveness of real right creation and transfer between parties.
- **(A2 denies R1)** in the context of being effective against third parties, as registration is a necessary step for such effectiveness.

Given the query: "If a mortgage creation contract has the agreement of the mortgagee and of the mortgagor that has ownership of the subject matter of the mortgage, it will be effective even if it is not in writing and there is no registration of its creation."

### Justification
- **(query entails B1)** because both consider scenarios where the effectiveness of a real right's creation or transfer does not strictly require a written agreement.
- Considering the presence of an agreement (mortgagee and mortgagor's consent) and the specifics about writing and registration, we then compare this to the root node's statement about effectiveness solely through manifestations of intention:
- **(query agree R1)** because both assert that between parties, the creation or transfer can be effective based on their agreements, even without fulfilling additional formalities like writing or registration.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of real property law and the distinction between inter-party effectiveness and effectiveness against third parties, it's clear that while the query aligns with R1 in terms of inter-party agreement sufficing for certain effects, the broader context (including Article 177) indicates a more nuanced scenario where registration impacts enforceability against third parties. However, strictly within the confines of the query and R1 as defined:
- The conclusion stands as initially justified.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should represent the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 446, the primary focus is on the responsibilities and formal requirements of a guarantor in a guarantee contract. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A guarantor is responsible for performing the obligation if the principal obligor fails.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These factors should either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion represented by the root node.
- **A1**: The guarantee contract must be in writing to be effective.
- **A2**: Electronic or magnetic records can serve as written contracts for guarantees.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1** and **A2**, we can refine them further:
- For **A1**:
  - **B1**: The contract's effectiveness hinges on its written form.
- For **A2**:
  - **B2**: Electronic or magnetic records are considered written forms for guarantee contracts.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1 supports A1**): Having a contract in writing is crucial for its effectiveness, which directly supports the abstract factor that written form is necessary.
- (**B2 supports A2**): Recognizing electronic or magnetic records as written forms supports the notion that these can serve as valid written contracts.
- (**A1 supports R1**): The requirement for a guarantee contract to be in writing indirectly supports the guarantor's responsibility by ensuring there's a clear, legally binding agreement.
- (**A2 supports R1**): By allowing electronic or magnetic records as written forms, it facilitates the creation of legally binding guarantee contracts, thereby supporting the guarantor's responsibility.

### Justification of Query against ANGELIC Structure
Given the query: "A guarantor may revoke a contract of guarantee that is not in writing. However, this shall not apply for the portion that has been performed."

- **(Query entails B1)**: The query directly pertains to the scenario where a guarantee contract's form (written or not) affects its validity and the guarantor's obligations, which aligns with the consideration of written contracts being essential (**B1**).
  
- To evaluate if the query agrees or disagrees with the root node **R1**, let's analyze:
  - The query discusses the revocation of a guarantee contract not in writing but does not negate the responsibility of the guarantor for obligations that have been performed. This implies that while there might be conditions under which a guarantor can revoke their obligation (if the contract is not in writing), it does not entirely absolve them of responsibility, especially for portions already performed.
  - Therefore, **(Query agree R1)**: The query, by stating that revocation doesn't apply to portions that have been performed, indirectly supports the root node's stance that a guarantor has responsibility for performing the obligation, albeit with specific conditions regarding contract form and performance.

After re-justification, considering the nuances of legal obligations and contract forms, the conclusion remains that the query aligns with the principles outlined in the ANGELIC structure, particularly supporting the notion of a guarantor's responsibility under certain conditions.

wrong prediction case 34
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the article is to establish that a person who commences the management of a business for another person without being obliged to do so may not demand compensation from the principal, even if they expend useful expenses for the principal, when that management is against the intention of the principal.
- **Root Node (R1):** A manager cannot demand compensation from the principal for expenses incurred while managing the principal's business against their will.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The manager's right to reimbursement for beneficial expenses.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The manager's authority to act on behalf of the principal.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The principal's intention regarding the management of their business.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **Abstract Factor (A1)**, we have:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Expenses incurred by the manager are beneficial to the principal.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The manager acted without prior authorization from the principal.
- Under **Abstract Factor (A2)**, we consider:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The manager's actions were taken in good faith but against the principal's expressed will.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1):** Beneficial expenses generally support a manager's right to reimbursement.
- **(B2 denies A1):** Lack of authorization can deny the manager's right to reimbursement for those expenses.
- **(B3 denies A2):** Acting against the principal's will undermines the manager's authority.

Given the query: "A person who commences the management of a business for another person without being obliged to do so may not demand compensation from the principal, even if he/she expends useful expenses for the principal, when that management is against the intention of the principal."

- **(query entails B2):** The scenario described in the query directly involves a situation where management and expenses are incurred without obligation and against the principal's intention, aligning with Base-Level Factor (B2).
  
Considering the query in relation to the Root Node (R1), both address scenarios where management is undertaken against the principal's will, and compensation for expenses is considered.

- **(query agree R1):** The query agrees with the root node that a manager cannot demand compensation from the principal for expenses incurred while managing the business against their will.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of legal interpretations and the specifics of each scenario:
- The agreement between the query and the Root Node (R1) remains consistent because both emphasize the importance of the principal's intention and the manager's lack of obligation in determining compensation for expenses incurred during unauthorized management. 

Thus, the conclusion after careful consideration is:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 474 seeks to establish that a third party may perform an obligation under certain conditions. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A third party may perform an obligation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **A1**: The legitimacy of the third party's interest in performing the obligation.
- **A2**: The will of the obligor regarding the performance by a third party.
- **A3**: The nature of the obligation and whether it permits performance by a third party.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining the abstract factors:
- **B1** (under A1): The third party has no legitimate interest in performing the obligation.
- **B2** (under A2): The obligor's will is against the performance by a third party.
- **B3** (under A3): The nature of the obligation does not permit performance by a third party.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Having no legitimate interest directly relates to the legitimacy of the third party's action.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The obligor's will being against the performance directly impacts the condition under which a third party can perform.
- **(B3 supports A3)**: If the nature of the obligation does not permit third-party performance, it directly affects whether the obligation can be performed by a third party.
- **(A1 denies R1)**: If there's no legitimate interest, generally, the third party cannot perform against the obligor's will.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: The obligor's opposition is a condition that restricts the performance by a third party.
- **(A3 denies R1)**: If the obligation's nature prohibits it, then a third party cannot perform it.

### Justification:
Given the query "A third party who has no interest in an obligation may not perform the obligation against the will of the obligor," we can see that:
- **(query entails B1)**: Because both consider scenarios where the third party lacks legitimate interest.
- **(query agrees R1)**: In the context provided by Article 474, the query and R1 are discussing conditions under which a third party may or may not perform an obligation. The query specifies a condition (lack of interest and against the obligor's will) that aligns with restrictions on when a third party can perform an obligation, as outlined in R1.

Upon re-justification, considering the structure and links established:
- The query directly relates to B1 because it discusses a scenario where a third party has no interest.
- The agreement with R1 is based on understanding that both the query and R1 discuss conditions for third-party performance of obligations, with the query specifying a condition that falls under the broader statement of R1.

wrong prediction case 36
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break down the process into steps based on the provided legal provisions and the query.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should represent the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 462, the focus is on the rights and obligations of a guarantor who has given a guarantee without the request of the principal obligor and performs an act for extinguishment of obligation. Therefore, the root node (R1) can be defined as:
- R1: A person who becomes a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor has specific rights to reimbursement.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For Article 462, these could include:
- A1: The guarantor's right to reimbursement is limited to the extent they are currently enriched.
- A2: The principal obligor's potential grounds for set-off against the obligee can affect the guarantor's demand for reimbursement.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors helps in addressing specific conditions directly. For instance:
- B1 (supports A1): The guarantor must demonstrate current enrichment to claim reimbursement.
- B2 (supports A2): The principal obligor's assertion of grounds for set-off prior to the demand for reimbursement can alter the guarantor's rights.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Each abstract factor and base-level factor should have a directed link indicating whether it supports or denies another factor or the root node. For example:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1 (since limited reimbursement is a right of such guarantors)
- A2 supports R1 (as it details a condition affecting reimbursement rights)

### Applying the ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the steps above, we have:
- Root Node: R1
- Abstract Factors: A1, A2
- Base-Level Factors: B1, B2
- Directed Links:
  - B1 supports A1
  - B2 supports A2
  - A1 supports R1
  - A2 supports R1

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root Node
The query states: "A third party who has no interest in an obligation may not guarantee an obligation against the will of the obligor."
- This query does not directly match any base-level factor (B1 or B2) as those factors discuss reimbursement rights after becoming a guarantor, not the act of becoming a guarantor itself.
- However, considering the spirit of the query and its focus on the conditions under which a third party can become a guarantor, it seems to touch upon principles related to A1 and A2 indirectly by questioning the premise of becoming a guarantor without the obligor's consent. Yet, it does not directly entail any base-level factor as defined.
- Regarding agreement with the root node (R1), the query essentially questions the initial condition (becoming a guarantor against the will of the obligor) rather than the rights following such an action. Thus, it doesn't directly agree or disagree with R1 but rather challenges a presupposition leading to the scenario where R1 applies.

### Re-Justification
Upon re-evaluation, considering the query's focus on whether a third party can guarantee an obligation against the obligor's will, and comparing this with the defined structure:
- The query does not directly entail any base-level factor as it addresses a different aspect (the act of becoming a guarantor) than what B1 and B2 discuss (rights following that act).
- The query's premise seems to disagree with the scenario that leads to R1, as R1 discusses rights after one has become a guarantor against the obligor's will, implying such a situation can occur. However, this is not a direct disagreement with R1's conclusion about reimbursement rights but rather a challenge to the initial condition.

Output:
- (query does not entail B1 or B2 directly)
- Given the nuances and the focus on different aspects of the legal scenario, it's challenging to categorize the query as directly agreeing or disagreeing with R1 without considering the broader context of guarantee obligations. However, if forced to choose based on the direct implications:
  - (query seems to implicitly challenge a condition leading to R1 rather than its conclusion)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the provided legal provisions and the query to construct the ANGELIC structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The Root Node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Given the context of Articles 541, 542, 559, and 564, and the query about cancelling a contract due to defects in a building, we can identify the Root Node as:
- **R1:** A party may cancel a contract if the purpose of the contract cannot be achieved due to non-performance or defects.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract Factors are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. Based on the articles, we can derive:
- **A1:** Non-performance of obligations.
- **A2:** Nature of the contract and its purpose.
- **A3:** Right to claim compensation for loss or damage.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1:** Non-performance of obligations, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1:** Failure to perform due to impossibility.
  - **B2:** Failure to perform due to refusal or neglect.
- Under **A2:** Nature of the contract and its purpose, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B3:** The contract's purpose cannot be achieved without specific performance (e.g., timely completion).
- Under **A3:** Right to claim compensation for loss or damage, while important, it does not directly refine into a base-level factor related to the query about cancelling due to defects.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- **B1** supports **A1**.
- **B2** supports **A1**.
- **B3** supports **A2**.
- **A1** supports **R1**.
- **A2** supports **R1**.

Given the query, "If a building that is the subject matter of a job in a building contract has any defect, and the purpose of the contract cannot be achieved because of the defect, the party ordering the work may cancel the contract for that reason," we analyze its relationship with our constructed structure:

- The query entails **B3** because it discusses a situation where defects (implying non-performance or improper performance) affect the achievement of the contract's purpose.
- The query agrees with **R1** since both conclude that cancellation is an option when the contract's purpose cannot be fulfilled, in this case, due to defects.

Therefore, based on our analysis:
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

After re-justification, considering the context of contractual obligations and the impact of defects on achieving a contract's purpose, these conclusions remain consistent with the provided legal framework.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 620 is that if a lease is cancelled, the cancellation becomes effective solely toward the future and does not preclude a claim for compensation for loss or damage.
   - **Root Node R1:** "Cancellation of a lease affects only future obligations and does not prevent claims for past damages."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - **Abstract Factor A1:** The principle that cancellation affects only future obligations.
   - **Abstract Factor A2:** The allowance for claims of compensation for loss or damage despite cancellation.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - **Base-Level Factor B1** under A1: Cancellation does not affect past contractual obligations.
   - **Base-Level Factor B2** under A2: Parties can claim damages for losses incurred before cancellation.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - (B1 supports A1)
   - (B2 supports A2)
   - (A1 supports R1)
   - (A2 supports R1)

Given the query, "The cancellation of a partnership contract shall solely become effective toward the future," we need to analyze if it entails base-level factors and if it agrees or disagrees with the root node.

- The query implies that the cancellation affects only future obligations in a partnership context, which aligns with the principle stated in Article 684 that applies the provisions of Article 620 mutatis mutandis to partnership contracts.
- **(query entails B1)** because both consider the effect of cancellation on future obligations.
- Since R1 deals with leases but the underlying principle (cancellation affects only future obligations) is applied to partnership contracts through Article 684, and given that the query talks about partnership contracts:
- **(query agree R1)** in the sense that both assert cancellations have future-oriented effects, despite R1 specifically mentioning leases. The extension of this principle to partnership contracts via Article 684 supports the agreement.

After rejustification, considering the legal context provided and the application of principles from one area (leases) to another (partnership contracts), the conclusion remains consistent with the initial analysis. 

**Output:**
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 39
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that when one of the parties exercises the right to cancel a contract, each party must restore the other to its original state without prejudicing third-party rights, and this includes refunding monies with accrued interest, returning things with their fruits, and does not preclude claims for compensation.

- **Root Node (R1):** The exercise of the right to cancel a contract requires restoration of parties to their original state, including financial restitution with interest, return of goods with their fruits, and potential compensation for damages.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors include:
- The obligation to restore each party's original state.
- The payment of interest on refunded monies.
- The return of non-monetary items with any accrued benefits (fruits).
- The possibility of claiming compensation for loss or damage.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Obligation to restore original state.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Financial restitution, including interest on monies.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Return of non-monetary items with accrued benefits.
- **Abstract Factor (A4):** Claiming compensation for loss or damage.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under A1, a base-level factor could be the specific actions required to restore the original state, such as refunding payments.
- Under A2, a base-level factor could involve calculating interest on monies received.
- For A3 and A4, base-level factors might include determining what constitutes "fruits" of an item or assessing damages for compensation.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Refund of purchase price paid.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Calculation of interest on refunded monies from the time of receipt.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Determination of "fruits" to be returned with non-monetary items.
- **Base-Level Factor (B4):** Assessment of damages for compensation claims.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- B1 supports A1.
- B2 supports A2.
- B3 supports A3.
- B4 supports A4.
- A1, A2, A3, and A4 all support R1.

Given the query: "If after a sales contract for moveables is entered and a portion of the purchase price is paid, the sales contract is cancelled due to default of the seller, then he/she bears an obligation to compensate the buyer for damages, but in returning the portion of the purchase price that was received, there is no need to add interest from the time of that receipt of those moneys."

### Justification
- The query entails a situation where the sales contract is cancelled and there's an obligation to refund the purchase price without necessarily adding interest, which seems to contradict the base-level factor B2 regarding the calculation of interest on refunded monies.
- **(query entails B1)** because it involves the refund of the purchase price paid.
- However, the query seems to disagree with the requirement for interest as stated in Article 545(2), thus potentially conflicting with B2 and by extension A2.

### Agreement/Disagreement with Root Node
The root node R1 emphasizes restoration to the original state, including financial restitution with interest. The query agrees on the necessity of refunding the purchase price (supporting part of R1) but seems to disagree on the aspect of adding interest (potentially denying a part of A2 which supports R1).

- **(query disagree R1)** because while it aligns with parts of the restoration requirement, it specifically mentions not needing to add interest, which contradicts one of the supporting factors of R1.

Upon rejustification, considering the emphasis on contractual obligations and restitution following cancellation:
- The disagreement seems more nuanced, focusing on the specifics of financial restitution (interest calculation) rather than the overarching principle of restoring parties to their original state.
- The query's stance on not adding interest could be seen as a specific interpretation or condition under which R1 operates, particularly in scenarios where contractual terms or legal precedents might exempt such calculations.

Thus, the initial analysis stands with a nuanced understanding that the disagreement is more about specifics within the agreement rather than the fundamental principle of restoration and compensation.

 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a manifestation of intention is voidable under certain conditions related to mistakes in understanding or intention. Thus, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A manifestation of intention can be voidable due to material mistakes regarding the intention or circumstances.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The existence of a mistake that is material in light of the purpose of the juridical act and common sense.
- **A2**: The indication that certain circumstances were taken as the basis for the juridical act, relevant for mistakes about those circumstances.
- **A3**: Gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we can have:
  - **B1**: The mistake concerns the person's lack of corresponding intention.
  - **B2**: The mistake involves an incorrect understanding of the circumstances that form the basis for the juridical act.
- Under **A3**, we consider scenarios where gross negligence affects the ability to rescind, such as:
  - **B3**: The other party was aware or should have been aware of the mistake due to their own gross negligence.
  - **B4**: Both parties were under the same mistake.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **B1 supports A1**, as it specifies a condition under which a mistake can void a manifestation of intention.
- **B2 supports A1**, offering another scenario where a mistake leads to voidability.
- **A1 supports R1**, because the existence of such material mistakes directly contributes to the voidability of a manifestation of intention.
- **B3 supports A3**, and **B4 supports A3**, as they provide conditions under which gross negligence does not preclude rescission.
- **A3 denies R1** in cases where gross negligence is involved without the specified exceptions.

### Analysis of Query
Given the query about person C being unaware that real property L belonged to person A at the time of executing a sales contract with person B, and considering this mistake regarding an essential element of the contract:
- **(query entails B2)** because it involves a mistake about circumstances (ownership) crucial for the juridical act (the sale).

Considering the directed links and the query's scenario:
- Since **B2 supports A1**, and **A1 supports R1**, we can infer that in a comparable situation, the query would align with the root node regarding the voidability of manifestations of intention due to material mistakes.

Thus, regarding agreement or disagreement with the root node (R1) on whether a manifestation of intention can be voidable under such conditions:
- **(query agree R1)** because both the query scenario and R1 involve situations where a mistake about essential circumstances leads to the voidability of a juridical act's manifestation of intention.

After careful consideration, this justification holds as it accurately reflects how mistakes about crucial aspects (like ownership in real property transactions) can indeed lead to the voidability of contractual agreements based on the provided legal framework.

 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that statutory liens for construction work on immovables exist under certain conditions. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: Statutory lien for construction work exists with respect to immovables.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- A1: Expenses of construction work performed by a person who designs, constructs, or supervises construction regarding the immovables of the obligor.
- A2: Current increase in the value of the immovables resulting from the construction work.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors:
- B1: The person performing the construction work has a direct role in designing, constructing, or supervising the project.
- B2: The construction work leads to an increase in the value of the immovables.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Given the query, "Provisions for statutory liens for real property construction are established in the Civil Code," we can see it aligns with the scenario described by the base-level factors and the root node. 

The query directly relates to the establishment of statutory liens for construction work on immovables, which is what R1 states. Therefore, the query agrees with R1.

Justifying whether the query entails a base-level factor:
- The query does not specifically mention the role of the person performing the construction (B1) or the increase in value due to construction (B2), but it implies the existence of provisions for statutory liens, which aligns more closely with the abstract factors and the root node.

Justifying whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root:
- The query essentially states that provisions for statutory liens are established, which aligns with R1 stating that a statutory lien for construction work exists under certain conditions. Therefore, (query agree R1).

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and the implications of each factor:
- The query directly speaks to the existence of statutory lien provisions in the Civil Code, which supports the concept presented by R1 without directly addressing the specific base-level factors B1 or B2.

Therefore, the final justification is that (query agree R1).

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 15 is that the family court may decide to commence an assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder.

- **Root Node (R1):** The family court may commence assistance for a person with inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- The person's capacity to appreciate their own situation being inadequate due to a mental disorder.
- The request for assistance coming from specific individuals (the person in question, spouse, relative within the fourth degree of kinship, guardian, etc.).

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Inadequate capacity to appreciate one's situation due to a mental disorder.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Valid request for assistance from authorized individuals.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- For A1, we can refine it based on the degree of inadequacy (extremely inadequate vs. inadequate).
- For A2, refinement could be based on who makes the request, but since both articles mention similar sets of individuals, this might not yield distinct base-level factors applicable to our specific query.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The person's capacity is extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The request for assistance comes from an authorized individual as specified in Article 15.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- B1 supports A1 because if the capacity is extremely inadequate, it certainly falls under being inadequate.
- B2 supports A2 since a request from an authorized individual is necessary for commencing assistance.
- A1 supports R1 as inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder justifies commencing assistance.
- A2 supports R1 since a valid request is required for the court to consider commencing assistance.

Given the query: "The family court may decide to commence an assistance also in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is extremely inadequate due to a mental disorder."

### Justification
- **(query entails B1):** The query directly mentions a scenario where the person's capacity is extremely inadequate, aligning with Base-Level Factor B1.
  
Considering the structure and the query:
- The query essentially discusses a condition (extremely inadequate capacity) that falls under the broader category of being inadequate. 
- **(query agree R1):** Since both Article 15 and the query discuss scenarios where assistance can be commenced due to mental disorder-related inadequacies, they align in principle regarding when assistance can be provided.

Therefore, based on the construction and analysis:
- The query directly entails Base-Level Factor B1 because it specifies a condition (extremely inadequate capacity) that would necessitate assistance.
- The query agrees with Root Node R1 as both pertain to the commencement of assistance for individuals with mental disorders affecting their capacity, differing only in the degree of inadequacy but not the principle of providing assistance. 

Hence, after careful justification and rejustification:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 15 is that the family court may decide to commence assistance in respect of a person whose capacity to appreciate their own situation is inadequate due to a mental disorder under certain conditions. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1:** The family court may commence assistance for a person with inadequate capacity due to a mental disorder.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** Request for commencement of assistance by an eligible party.
- **A2:** Capacity of the person in question to appreciate their own situation.
- **A3:** Consent of the person in question when the request is made by another party.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1:** The request is made by the person in question themselves.
  - **B2:** The request is made by a person other than the person in question (e.g., spouse, relative within the fourth degree of kinship, guardian, etc.).
- Under **A2**, no further refinement seems necessary for this analysis.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B3:** The person in question gives their consent to the commencement of assistance when requested by another party.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
The directed links are as follows:
- **B1 supports A1**: Because if the request is made by the person themselves, it directly fulfills one of the conditions for commencing assistance.
- **B2 supports A1**: This also fulfills a condition but requires additional considerations like consent from the person in question.
- **B3 supports A3**: Consent from the person in question is crucial when the request is made by another party.

Given these steps, we can now analyze the query:
"The issuance of a decision for commencement of assistance at the request of a person other than the person in question requires the consent of the person in question unless the family court finds it to be suitable."

### Justification
- The query directly references a scenario where **B2** is applicable (request by another party) and introduces an exception based on the court's finding, which can be seen as affecting **B3** (consent requirement).
- Therefore, we can say that **(query entails B2)** because it discusses a specific condition under which assistance may be commenced when requested by someone other than the person in question.
- Additionally, the introduction of an exception based on the court's finding could imply a nuanced approach to consent, but fundamentally, the query still revolves around the necessity of consent or its waiver under certain conditions. Hence, **(query entails B3)** indirectly because it touches upon the idea of consent and exceptions thereto.

Regarding agreement with the root node (R1):
- The query essentially agrees with the core principle that assistance may be commenced under certain conditions but introduces an additional consideration (the court's finding) for when consent is not strictly required. This does not fundamentally disagree with R1 but rather specifies a condition under which assistance can be provided without explicit consent.
- Therefore, **(query agree R1)** because both the query and Article 15 allow for the commencement of assistance under specific conditions, including requests by other parties and considerations regarding the person's capacity and consent.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation:
- The core elements of the query align with the base-level factors related to requests by other parties (**B2**) and the nuances of consent (**B3**).
- The agreement with R1 stands because both the original article and the query framework support the commencement of assistance under defined conditions, including considerations for capacity and consent.

Hence, the conclusions **(query entails B2)**, **(query entails B3)** (in a broader sense related to consent and its exceptions), and **(query agree R1)** are reaffirmed upon careful consideration.

correct prediction case 44
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, we will follow the step-by-step approach to construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 18 is that if the grounds for commencement of assistance cease to exist, the family court must rescind the decision for commencement of assistance under certain conditions. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: The family court must rescind the decision for commencement of assistance when the grounds cease to exist.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The existence of grounds prescribed in the main clause of Article 15, paragraph (1).
- A2: The request by an eligible party for rescission of the decision.
- A3: The family court's discretion to rescind all or part of the decision.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2:
- B1: The grounds prescribed in Article 15, paragraph (1) have ceased to exist.
- B2: An eligible party (as defined) has made a request for rescission of the decision.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (B1 supports A1): If the grounds cease to exist, it supports the condition for rescinding the assistance decision.
- (B2 supports A2): An eligible party's request directly supports the action for rescission.
- (A1 supports R1): The cessation of grounds is a direct reason for the court to rescind the decision.
- (A2 supports R1): A request from an eligible party is a condition under which the court may rescind the decision.

Given the query: "If the grounds of commencement of assistance cease to exist, the family court may rescind the decision for commencement of assistance without any party's request."

### Justification
- (query entails B1) because both consider the scenario where the grounds for commencement of assistance have ceased.
- However, the query seems to disagree with R1 in terms of requiring a request from an eligible party. The original text implies that a rescission can occur at the request of specific individuals, but it does not explicitly state that such a request is necessary when the grounds cease to exist. The query suggests that the family court may act without a request, which introduces a nuance not directly supported by the provided text.

### Rejustification
Upon closer examination, the original Article 18(1) states that if the grounds cease to exist, the family court "must" rescind the decision at the request of certain parties. This implies an action contingent on a request when grounds cease. However, it does not explicitly address what happens in the absence of such a request but with ceased grounds. The query introduces a scenario (action without a request) that isn't directly addressed by the provided legal text, suggesting a potential gap or ambiguity in how the regulation is presented.

Therefore, considering the direct information given and focusing strictly on the entailment regarding base-level factors and agreement/disagreement with the root:
- (query entails B1)
- The query seems to introduce a scenario not explicitly covered by R1 as defined from the provided text, thus potentially disagreeing with how R1 is conditioned in the original text. However, given the strict definitions and focusing on direct entailments without introducing assumptions beyond the provided text:
- It's challenging to directly conclude (query agree R1) or (query disagree R1) without assuming additional context not provided by the query or the original article regarding the necessity of a request for rescission when grounds cease.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 17 is to establish that the family court may grant permission operating in lieu of an assistant's consent for specific acts if such acts are unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: The family court may grant permission in lieu of an assistant's consent for certain acts.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The requirement for obtaining consent from the assistant for specific juridical acts.
- **A2**: The condition that the act must not prejudice the interests of the person under assistance.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2**:
- **B1**: The assistant does not consent to an act.
- **B2**: The act is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance.
- **B3**: The request for permission is made by the person under assistance.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The lack of consent from the assistant directly relates to the requirement for obtaining consent.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The condition that the act must not be prejudicial is directly supported by the fact that it's unlikely to cause prejudice.
- **(B3 supports R1)**: The request by the person under assistance is a base-level factor supporting the root node, as it's a scenario where the family court may grant permission.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The requirement for consent supports the conclusion that the court may grant permission in its lieu.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The condition of non-prejudice supports the court granting permission.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "If the assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the assistant's consent, at the request of the person under assistance."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query directly mentions a scenario where the assistant does not consent.
- **(query entails B2)**: It also mentions the act is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance.
- **(query entails B3)**: The query specifies that the request for permission is made by the person under assistance.

### Agreement with Root Node
The query essentially describes a scenario where all conditions (**B1**, **B2**, and **B3**) are met, which supports the root node **R1**. Therefore:
- **(query agree R1)**: The query agrees with the verdict of the root node that under certain conditions, the family court may grant permission in lieu of an assistant's consent.

After careful reconsideration, this analysis holds true as it directly maps the conditions and outcome described in the query to the base-level factors and the root node of the constructed ANGELIC structure. 

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 35 seeks to establish that with certain exceptions, foreign juridical persons permitted under Japanese law possess the same private rights as those possessed by a juridical person of the same kind formed in Japan, with specific limitations.

- **Root Node (R1):** A foreign juridical person permitted under Japanese law has the same private rights as a domestic juridical person of the same kind, except where restricted by law or treaty.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The type of foreign juridical person and its eligibility under Japanese law.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The existence of special provisions in laws or treaties that limit the rights of foreign nationals or entities.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The foreign juridical person is specifically permitted by a law or treaty.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** There are no special provisions in laws or treaties restricting the rights of this specific type of foreign juridical person.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The permission under a law or treaty directly supports the eligibility of the foreign juridical person.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The absence of restrictive special provisions supports the notion that there are no legal limitations to the rights of this foreign juridical person.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Eligibility under Japanese law supports the conclusion that a foreign juridical person has similar private rights.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: Special provisions restricting rights would deny or limit the conclusion that a foreign juridical person has the same private rights as a domestic one.

Given the query: "A foreign juridical person permitted possesses the same private rights even if a foreign national is not entitled to enjoy the rights as those possessed by a juridical person of the same kind that has been formed in Japan."

- **(query entails B2)**: The query considers a scenario where there might be restrictions on what a foreign national can enjoy, which aligns with considering special provisions (or their absence) as in B2.

Comparing the query to the root node R1:
- The query seems to suggest that despite certain restrictions (like those on foreign nationals), a permitted foreign juridical person still has similar rights. This interpretation seems to **agree** with the general principle outlined in R1, which allows for exceptions based on laws or treaties but fundamentally supports equal private rights for eligible foreign juridical persons.

Therefore:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

After rejustification, considering the nuances of legal language and the structure provided, the analysis holds that the query does indeed align with the concept presented in B2 regarding special provisions and agrees with the fundamental principle stated in R1, acknowledging the equality of private rights for permitted foreign juridical persons under Japanese law, with due consideration for exceptions.

correct prediction case 47
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The article seeks to establish that a manifestation of intention is voidable if it is based on certain mistakes and those mistakes are material in light of the purpose of the juridical act and common sense in the transaction.
   - **Root Node (R1):** A manifestation of intention can be voidable due to material mistakes.

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
     - **Abstract Factor (A1):** Materiality of the mistake in light of the purpose of the juridical act.
     - **Abstract Factor (A2):** Materiality of the mistake considering common sense in the transaction.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - Refining A1 and A2:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The person making the manifestation lacks the intention corresponding to it due to a mistake.
     - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The person holds an understanding that does not correspond to the truth regarding the circumstances of the juridical act.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - Each abstract factor supports the root node, and each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor.
   - **(A1 supports R1)**
   - **(A2 supports R1)**
   - **(B1 supports A1)**
   - **(B2 supports A2)**

Given the query: "With respect to the rescission of a manifestation of intention on the ground of a mistake, whether the mistake is material or not is decided on the basis of the person making the manifestation of intention."

- The query essentially discusses how the materiality of a mistake is determined from the perspective of the person making the manifestation. This directly relates to **Base-Level Factor (B1)** because it involves understanding the intentions and understandings of the person, which could be influenced by mistakes.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.

Considering the root node **R1**, the query discusses a condition (materiality of the mistake) that affects whether a manifestation of intention can be voidable. The query doesn't directly contradict or agree with the verdict presented in R1 but provides insight into how materiality is determined, which indirectly supports the structure of determining voidability based on material mistakes.

Thus, **(query agree R1)** because both the query and R1 consider the importance of material mistakes in the context of voiding a manifestation of intention, even though they focus on different aspects (determination of materiality vs. the outcome of being voidable).

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances of legal interpretations and the specific wording of the provisions and the query, the conclusion remains consistent with the initial analysis.

Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

wrong prediction case 48
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process step by step according to the provided instructions and legal provisions.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 120 seeks to establish conditions under which an act can be rescinded, specifically focusing on the grounds of qualified legal capacity, mistake, fraud, or duress. Thus, the root node (R) can be defined as:
- **R1:** An act can be rescinded based on specific legal grounds.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
- **A1:** The act being voidable due to qualified legal capacity issues.
- **A2:** The act being voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1:** The person who performed the act lacked qualified legal capacity.
- Under **A2**, base-level factors could include:
  - **B2:** The act was performed under mistake.
  - **B3:** The act was performed under fraud.
  - **B4:** The act was performed under duress.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A2**, **B3 supports A2**, and **B4 supports A2**
- **A1 supports R1** and **A2 supports R1**

Given the query: "If an act that may be rescinded by a person (A) who made the defective manifestation of intention on the ground of A's mistake, the act is also voidable by the counterparty (B)."

### Justification
- The query specifically mentions an act being rescindable due to a mistake, which aligns with **B2**.
- Therefore, **(query entails B2)** because both consider scenarios where a mistake has occurred.
- Since **B2 supports A2**, and **A2 supports R1**, the query indirectly supports **R1**.
- However, the query introduces an additional element by stating the act is also voidable by the counterparty (B), which isn't directly addressed in the provided articles but implies a broader application of rescindability than what's outlined for mistakes or qualified legal capacity issues.
- Given this, we need to assess if the introduction of the counterparty's ability to void the act aligns with or contradicts **R1**. The root node focuses on the conditions under which an act can be rescinded without explicitly limiting it to the person who made the defective manifestation or their representatives.
- Therefore, considering the spirit of the articles that outline conditions for rescission without directly addressing counterparty rights in this specific scenario, we could interpret the query as not directly contradicting **R1** but rather seeking clarification on its application. Hence, **(query agree R1)** in the sense that it explores a nuanced application of the principle that an act can be rescinded based on specific legal grounds, without fundamentally disagreeing with the premise.

After rejustification:
- The conclusion remains that the query entails a base-level factor concerning mistakes (**B2**).
- The agreement with **R1** is based on the interpretation that the query explores aspects of rescindability under specific conditions, aligning with the principle that acts can be rescinded due to legal grounds such as mistake.

Output:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 121-2 is that a person who has received payment or delivery as the performance of an obligation based on a void act must restore the other party to the original state. However, for a voidable act, if the recipient did not know it was voidable at the time of receipt, they only need to return what they are currently enriched by.

Root Node (R1): A person who receives payment or delivery based on a void or voidable act must restore or return according to specific conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
- A1: Receipt of payment or delivery under a void act.
- A2: Knowledge at the time of receipt regarding the voidability of the act.
- A3: The nature of the act (void or voidable).

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
- B1 (under A1): Receipt without knowledge that the act was void or voidable.
- B2 (under A2): Lack of knowledge at the time of receipt about the act's voidability.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- B1 supports A1 because receiving payment under a void act without knowing it's void directly relates to the obligation to restore.
- B2 supports A2 since not knowing about the voidability affects the extent of return.
- A1 supports R1 as it directly leads to the conclusion that restoration is required.
- A2 supports R1 by clarifying the conditions under which restoration or return is required.

### Directed Links
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)

Given the query: "If a gift without burden was rescinded on the ground of a mistake by the donor (A), but the donee (B) had already received the payment or delivery based on the gift contract, and B did not know at the time of receiving the payment or delivery that the gift contract was voidable, B has an obligation to return to the extent currently enriched."

### Analysis
- The query entails B2 because it considers a scenario where the donee (B) did not know about the voidability of the gift contract at the time of receipt.
- Since B2 supports A2 and A2 supports R1, the query essentially agrees with the conditions outlined under R1 for returning what one is currently enriched by.

### Conclusion
(query entails B2)
(query agree R1)

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of Article 121-2 and the details provided in the query:
- The scenario clearly matches a situation where the donee's lack of knowledge about the voidability of the act affects their obligation to return what they are enriched by.
- Therefore, both the entailment of B2 and the agreement with R1 hold true under the given conditions.

Rejustification confirms that (query entails B2) and (query agree R1).

correct prediction case 50
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of the article is that a manifestation of intention can be voidable if it is based on certain mistakes and conditions are met.
   - **Root Node (R1):** "A manifestation of intention is voidable under specific mistake conditions."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Key legal factors include the type of mistake, materiality of the mistake in light of the purpose of the juridical act, and gross negligence.
   - **Abstract Factor (A1):** "The manifestation of intention is based on a mistake that is material to the purpose of the juridical act."
   - **Abstract Factor (A2):** "Gross negligence affects the ability to rescind the manifestation of intention."

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - Refining A1:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** "The mistake concerns a lack of corresponding intention."
     - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** "The mistake involves an incorrect understanding of circumstances taken as the basis for the juridical act, which was indicated to be crucial."
   - Refining A2:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** "Gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention prevents rescission unless the other party knew or should have known of the mistake."

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **(A1 supports R1)**
   - **(A2 denies R1)**
   - **(B1 supports A1)**
   - **(B2 supports A1)**
   - **(B3 supports A2)**

Given the query: "In the case a manifestation of intention of A to B is based on a mistake and the mistake is due to gross negligence on the part of A, A may not rescind the manifestation of intention, unless B knew, or did not know due to gross negligence, of the mistake on the part of A."

- **(query entails B3)** because both consider scenarios where gross negligence affects the ability to rescind a manifestation of intention based on a mistake.
- Comparing with the Root Node (R1), which states that "A manifestation of intention is voidable under specific mistake conditions," and considering the scenario described in the query, we see that the query actually **(query disagree R1)** because it outlines a condition where rescission is not possible due to gross negligence unless certain knowledge conditions are met by the other party, implying that the manifestation might not be voidable in cases of gross negligence without additional factors.

Upon re-justification:
- The query indeed entails B3 as both discuss scenarios involving gross negligence and its impact on rescinding a manifestation of intention.
- The disagreement with R1 stands because the query specifies conditions under which a manifestation cannot be rescinded due to gross negligence, which adds a layer of complexity not covered by the simple statement that a manifestation is voidable under specific mistake conditions. This suggests a more nuanced view where certain mistakes (especially those due to gross negligence) might not lead to the voidability of the manifestation without additional considerations.

Therefore:
- **(query entails B3)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

correct prediction case 51
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 117 is to establish that a person who concludes a contract as an agent of another person is liable for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage unless they prove their authority to represent or the principal ratifies the contract.

- **Root Node (R1):** A person acting as an agent without authority is liable for the contract's performance or compensation for loss or damage.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- The existence of authority to represent.
- The ratification of the contract by the principal.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Presence of Authority to Represent
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Ratification of the Contract by the Principal

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific conditions gives us:
- Under A1, a base-level factor could be the explicit granting of authority.
- Under A2, a base-level factor could be the principal's awareness and agreement to the contract.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Explicit Granting of Authority
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Principal's Awareness and Agreement

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(A1 supports R1):** If there is no authority, it supports the agent's liability.
- **(A2 supports R1):** Ratification by the principal can shift liability but initially supports the premise that without it, the agent is liable.
- **(B1 denies A1):** If explicit authority was granted, then A1 (lack of authority) is denied, suggesting the agent might not be liable due to having proper authorization.
- **(B2 supports A2):** The principal's awareness and agreement directly support the concept of ratification.

Given the query: "A, who acts as the agent of B, concluded a contract with C for sale of land owned by B. However, A had no authority to represent to conclude the contract. A is liable for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage, as chosen by A."

### Justification:
- The query entails **B1** because it directly addresses a situation where the agent (A) had no explicit authority to represent the principal (B), which aligns with the absence of an explicit granting of authority.
- However, upon closer examination, the query's focus is on the liability of A due to the lack of authority, which directly relates to **R1**. The query states A is liable, which aligns with the root node's determination under similar circumstances (lack of authority).
  
Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

After rejustification, considering the structure and the relationships between nodes, it's clear that the initial analysis correctly identifies the query's alignment with both a base-level factor and the root node concerning liability in the absence of explicit authority.

correct prediction case 52
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the query in relation to this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 117(1), the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A person who concludes a contract as an agent of another person is liable for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage unless they prove their authority to represent or the principal ratifies the contract.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the root legal conclusion. For Article 117(1), we can derive:
- **A1**: The agent's authority to represent the principal.
- **A2**: The principal's ratification of the contract.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors into more specific conditions gives us:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The agent had no explicit authority to conclude the contract.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: The principal ratifies the contract after it was concluded by the agent.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor and its base-level factors should have directed links indicating whether they support or deny the root node or other factors. For simplicity, let's establish that:
- **B1** denies **A1** because lacking explicit authority undermines the agent's representation.
- **B2** supports **A2** since ratification by the principal validates the contract.
- **A1** and **A2** both deny **R1** when present (i.e., if the agent had authority or the principal ratifies, the agent is not liable).

### Application to Query
Given the query: A, who acts as the agent of B, concluded a contract with C for the sale of land owned by B without authority. However, if B ratifies the contract, then:
- The query entails **B2** because it involves a scenario where the principal (B) ratifies the contract.
- Since **B2** supports **A2**, and given that the presence of **A2** (principal's ratification) denies **R1** (agent's liability), we can say the query agrees with the conditions under which **R1** is not applicable, thus:
  - (query entails B2)
  - Given the context, it implies a scenario where the agent might not be liable due to the principal's ratification, aligning with a denial of **R1** in this specific situation. However, the direct conclusion regarding agreement or disagreement with **R1** requires considering if the query's conditions (ratification by the principal) directly influence the root node's applicability.
  - Upon careful consideration, since the query specifies a scenario where the contract is ratified by B, it implies a condition under which A (the agent) would not be liable according to Article 117(1), thus aligning with an exception to **R1** rather than directly disagreeing with it. Therefore, the query essentially presents a scenario that aligns with the exceptions outlined in the article, meaning:
    - (query agree R1) when considering the broader principle that liability is contingent upon proof of authority or ratification by the principal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B2), (query agree R1)}$

wrong prediction case 53
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined in the instructions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The Root Node (R) is the outcome or legal conclusion that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 117, the Root Node can be identified as:
- R1: A person who concludes a contract as an agent of another person without authority is liable to the counterparty for the performance of the contract or compensation for loss or damage.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract Factors are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion. From Article 117, we can derive:
- A1: The agent's lack of authority to represent the principal.
- A2: The counterparty's knowledge or negligence regarding the agent's authority.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
We refine A2 into more specific conditions:
- B1: The counterparty knew that the agent had no authority to represent.
- B2: The counterparty was negligent in not knowing that the agent had no authority to represent, but this does not apply if the agent knew themselves to have no authority.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- A1 supports R1 because lacking authority is a direct condition for liability.
- B1 denies R1 because if the counterparty knew of the lack of authority, the agent is not liable.
- B2 denies R1 under specific conditions but generally supports A2.

### Applying ANGELIC Structure Formation Criteria
Given the query: "A, who acts as the agent of B, concluded a contract with C for sale of land owned by B. However, A had no authority to represent to conclude the contract. In the case that C was negligent in not knowing that A had no authority to represent, even if A knew themselves to have no authority to represent, A is not liable to C as an unauthorized agency."

### Justification
- The query entails B2 because it involves a scenario where the counterparty (C) was negligent in not knowing about the agent's (A) lack of authority, and A knew they had no authority.
- Given that B2 denies R1 under specific conditions and considering the details of the query, we see that the query disagrees with R1. The query presents a scenario where A is not liable to C due to C's negligence and A's knowledge of lacking authority, which aligns with an exception to the general rule stated in R1.

### Re-Justification
Upon re-examining the structure and the query:
- It is clear that the query specifically addresses a condition (B2) where the counterparty's negligence does not lead to the agent's liability if the agent knew they lacked authority.
- The core of the disagreement with R1 lies in the specifics of the scenario presented by the query, which highlights an exception to the general rule of liability for unauthorized agency.

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 166 is that a claim is extinguished by prescription under certain conditions. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A claim is extinguished by prescription.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. Based on Article 166, two abstract factors can be identified:
- **A1**: The obligee's knowledge of the exercisability of the right.
- **A2**: The time frame within which the obligee exercises the right.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- **B1** (under A1): The obligee knew that the right was exercisable.
- **B2** (under A2): The exercise of the right occurred within five years from when the obligee came to know it was exercisable or within 10 years from when it became exercisable.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Each abstract factor must either support or deny the occurrence of the root legal determination. Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor:
- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A2**
- **A1 supports R1** (Knowing the right is exercisable leads to the possibility of extinguishing the claim by prescription if not acted upon.)
- **A2 supports R1** (The specific time frames are conditions for the claim's extinction by prescription.)

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "A claim for damage due to non-performance is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise the right within five years from the time when the obligee came to know that it was exercisable."

- The query directly mentions a condition related to the timing of exercising the right, which aligns with **B2**. Therefore, **(query entails B2)**.
- Since B2 supports A2 and A2 in turn supports R1 (the claim being extinguished by prescription under certain conditions), the query's scenario is consistent with the root node's verdict that a claim can be extinguished by prescription if not exercised within specified time frames. Hence, **(query agrees R1)**.

Justifying this further:
- The query and B2 are considering similar scenarios where the timing of exercising the right after coming to know it's exercisable is crucial.
- This scenario supports A2 (time frame for exercising the right), which in turn supports the root node R1 (claim extinguished by prescription under specified conditions).

Therefore, based on the provided structure and analysis:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agrees R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break down the process step by step according to the provided instructions and analyze the given article and query.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 126 is that the right to rescind an act is extinguished by prescription if not exercised within five years from when it becomes possible to ratify the act, or if 20 years have passed since the act. Therefore, the Root Node can be stated as:
- R1: The right to rescind an act is extinguished by prescription under certain time conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: The time elapsed since the act became possible to ratify.
- A2: The total time passed since the act itself.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion about the extinguishment of the right to rescind an act due to prescription.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining the abstract factors:
- B1 supports A1: If less than five years have passed since it became possible to ratify the act, and no action was taken.
- B2 supports A1: If more than five years have passed since it became possible to ratify the act.
- B3 supports A2: If 20 years or more have passed since the time of the act.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A1
- B3 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Given this structure, let's analyze the query: "The right to rescind an act induced by fraud is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise the right within five years from the time of the act."

### Justification

The query seems to consider a scenario similar to Base-Level Factor B2 but with a slight difference in the timing reference (from the time of the act rather than from when it became possible to ratify). However, given the context and focusing on the core idea of prescription extinguishing the right to rescind within a certain timeframe:
- The query entails B2 because both deal with the concept of time passing (five years in this case) before the right is extinguished.

Regarding the agreement or disagreement with the Root Node R1:
- Since the query discusses a situation where the right to rescind an act is extinguished due to prescription after a certain period, it aligns with the principle stated in R1. Therefore, (query agree R1).

Rejustifying the answer after careful consideration confirms these conclusions.

### Output

- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)
======== ASP facts conversion step: ======= 
 entail(query, node(bfactor(2))).agree(query, node(root(1))).
correct prediction case 56
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 724 is that the claim for compensation for loss or damage caused by tort is extinguished by prescription under certain conditions.
   - Thus, the root node can be determined as: "The claim for compensation in torts is extinguished by prescription."
   - **Root Node (R1):** Claim for compensation in torts is extinguished by prescription.

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the conclusion are:
     1. The period within which the victim or their representative becomes aware of the damage and the perpetrator's identity.
     2. The overall time limit from the tortious act regardless of awareness.
   - **Abstract Factor (A1):** Exercise of right within three years from knowledge of damage and perpetrator.
   - **Abstract Factor (A2):** Exercise of right within 20 years from the time of the tortious act.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, a base-level factor could be the specific condition of knowing both the damage and the perpetrator's identity.
     - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Victim or representative knows the damage and the perpetrator's identity within three years.
   - For A2, a straightforward application is already presented as a time limit.
     - No further refinement needed for this example.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **(A1 supports R1)**: If the right is exercised within three years from knowing the damage and perpetrator, it supports the condition under which the claim can be extinguished by prescription.
   - **(A2 supports R1)**: The 20-year limit directly supports the conditions for extinction of the claim by prescription.
   - **(B1 supports A1)**: Knowing both the damage and the perpetrator within three years is a crucial factor supporting the condition under which the right must be exercised.

Given the query "The claim for compensation for loss or damage in torts is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise the right within 20 years from the time of the tortious act.":

- This directly aligns with **Abstract Factor (A2)** and its direct support for **Root Node (R1)**.
- The query essentially states a condition under which the claim is extinguished by prescription, which matches one of the conditions outlined in Article 724.

**Justification:**
- The query entails **Base-Level Factors** related to time limits but directly corresponds with **A2**, as it specifies a scenario (20 years from the tortious act) that aligns with A2's condition.
- Thus, **(query entails B1 is not accurate)** because B1 refers to knowledge of damage and perpetrator within three years, which isn't the focus of the query. Instead, we could consider it related to a base-level factor for A2 if we were to define one specifically about the 20-year time frame.
- The query **agrees with R1** because both state that under specific conditions (in this case, not exercising the right within 20 years), the claim for compensation in torts is extinguished by prescription.

Therefore:
- **(query entails B1)**: Not applicable directly as defined.
- **(query agree R1)**: Yes, they agree on the outcome regarding the extinction of the claim under the specified condition.

correct prediction case 57
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break down the legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that the period of prescription of a right determined by a final and binding judgment is 10 years, even if a shorter period is provided for. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: The period of prescription of a right determined by a final and binding judgment is 10 years.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The provision for a shorter period of prescription.
- A2: The determination of the right by a final and binding judgment.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1, we get:
- B1: The right has a period of prescription shorter than 10 years provided for it before the final judgment.
- B2: The claim is not yet due and payable at the time of determination.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Given the provisions:
- B1 supports A1, because if a right has a period of prescription shorter than 10 years, it directly relates to the consideration of what period should apply after a final judgment.
- B2 denies A1, because if the claim is not yet due and payable, the provisions regarding the period of prescription do not immediately apply as per paragraph (2).
- A1 denies R1, because if there's a provision for a shorter period, it challenges the blanket application of a 10-year prescription period.
- A2 supports R1, because a final and binding judgment determining the right is what triggers the consideration of the 10-year prescription period.

### Justification
Given the query: "If a right for which a period of prescription shorter than 10 years is provided is determined by a final and binding judgment, the period of prescription of the right is the shorter one."
- (query entails B1), because both consider a scenario where a right has a prescribed period of prescription shorter than 10 years before being determined by a final judgment.
- However, upon closer examination, the query seems to disagree with R1. The article states that despite a shorter period being provided for, the period of prescription becomes 10 years after a final and binding judgment. Thus, (query disagree R1).

After rejustification, considering the specifics of the legal provisions and how they apply to the scenario described in the query:
- The presence of B1 is confirmed because both deal with rights having a shorter prescribed period.
- The disagreement with R1 stands because the article aims to establish that regardless of the initially provided period, a final judgment sets the prescription period to 10 years, contrary to what the query suggests.

Therefore, the justified output remains:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

correct prediction case 58
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 168 is that a claim for periodic payments is extinguished by prescription under certain conditions.
   - Root Node (R1): A claim for periodic payments is extinguished by prescription.

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Abstract Factor (A1): The obligee does not exercise each claim for the delivery of things such as money arising from the claim for periodic payments within a specified timeframe.
   - Abstract Factor (A2): The obligee's failure to require a written acknowledgment from the obligor regarding the renewal of the prescription period.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1: The obligee does not exercise each claim within 10 years from the time when the obligee comes to know that each claim is exercisable.
   - Base-Level Factor (B2) under A1: The obligee does not exercise each claim within 20 years from the time when it becomes exercisable.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - B1 supports A1
   - B2 supports A1
   - A1 supports R1
   - A2 denies R1 (since acquiring a written acknowledgment can prevent prescription)

Given the query: "A claim for periodic payments is extinguished by prescription, if the obligee does not exercise each claim for the delivery of things such as money arising from the claim for periodic payments within 10 years from the time when the obligee comes to know that each claim is exercisable."

- **Justification:** The query directly corresponds with Base-Level Factor B1, which specifies a condition under which a claim for periodic payments is extinguished by prescription.
- Therefore, (query entails B1).
  
- Since B1 supports A1 and A1 supports R1, the query agrees with the conditions that lead to the Root Node R1's conclusion. 
- Hence, (query agree R1).

After rejustification, considering the specific scenario provided in the query matches the conditions outlined in Base-Level Factor B1, which in turn supports the overall conclusion of Root Node R1, the justification holds true.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 59
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a person who commences the possession of movables peacefully and openly by a transactional act acquires the rights exercised with respect to the movables immediately if they possess it in good faith and without negligence. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A person can acquire ownership of movables through good faith acquisition.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: Possession commenced peacefully and openly.
- **A2**: Possession is by a transactional act.
- **A3**: The person possesses in good faith.
- **A4**: The person possesses without negligence.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we could consider scenarios where possession is not only peaceful but also recognized by others, leading to:
  - **B1**: The possession is acknowledged by the community or relevant parties.
- Under **A3**, good faith implies that the person believes they have a right to possess the item without knowing it belongs to someone else, which could be further refined into:
  - **B2**: The person has a reasonable belief of ownership or right to possess.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **A1** supports **R1**: Peaceful and open possession is crucial for good faith acquisition.
- **A2** supports **R1**: Possession by a transactional act is necessary for acquiring rights.
- **A3** supports **R1**: Good faith is essential for the legitimacy of the acquisition.
- **A4** supports **R1**: Lack of negligence ensures the acquisition is not fraudulent or unjust.
- **B1** supports **A1**: Community acknowledgment strengthens the peaceful and open nature of possession.
- **B2** supports **A3**: A reasonable belief in ownership is key to possessing in good faith.

### Analysis of the Query
Given the query: "A took the jewelry that B had forgotten, believing without negligence that it belonged to A. In this case, A may not obtain the ownership of the jewelry by good faith acquisition."

- The query entails **B2** because both consider scenarios where a person has a reasonable belief of ownership or right to possess.
- However, upon closer examination, the query seems to disagree with **R1** in the context provided. The root node suggests that under conditions of good faith and peaceful possession, one can acquire ownership. The query presents a scenario where despite these conditions (A believes in good faith it belongs to them), A may not obtain ownership, suggesting an exception or disagreement.

Justifying further:
- The initial assessment might seem to suggest the query disagrees with **R1** due to the specific circumstances (forgotten jewelry) potentially not fulfilling all criteria for good faith acquisition (e.g., peaceful and open possession might be challenged if B had not abandoned the item).
- However, upon reevaluation considering the essence of good faith acquisition as outlined in the article, if A's belief that the jewelry belonged to them was genuinely without negligence and in good faith, the core principles of **R1** (good faith acquisition leading to ownership) would actually support A's potential claim to the jewelry under normal circumstances. The query's conclusion that "A may not obtain the ownership" could be seen as an exception rather than a rule, possibly due to other legal factors not directly addressed in the provided article (e.g., specific laws regarding lost and found items).

Thus, considering the structure and focusing on the most direct interpretation related to good faith acquisition:
- **(query entails B2)**
- Upon deeper analysis and reevaluation, it seems there might have been an oversight in directly linking the query's outcome with **R1**'s principle without fully accounting for the nuances of good faith acquisition. The disagreement or agreement with **R1** should be evaluated based on whether the scenario described by the query aligns with or challenges the principles of good faith acquisition as outlined. Given this, a more accurate final assessment would consider how the query's specifics interact with the legal framework provided.

Given the complexity and the need for precise alignment with the ANGELIC structure criteria and the nuances of legal interpretation:
- **(query entails B2)**
- The agreement or disagreement with **R1** should reflect whether the query supports or challenges the acquisition of ownership through good faith under the specific circumstances described, necessitating a careful consideration of the legal principles involved. 

Therefore, considering the initial analysis and the structure provided:
- The direct relationship between the query and the base-level factor is acknowledged.
- A deeper dive into the nuances of the query and its alignment with **R1**'s principle on good faith acquisition suggests that while there are aspects of agreement (in the context of good faith), specific legal outcomes can depend heavily on the interpretation of possession, good faith, and negligence in the scenario described. 

Hence, focusing strictly on the format requested for the output:
- **(query entails B2)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 193 is that the victim or the person who lost the thing may demand its return from the possessor within two years from the time of loss or theft. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: A victim or a person who lost an item has the right to demand its return from the current possessor within a specified timeframe.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The item in question constitutes stolen or lost property.
- **A2**: The possession of the item is peaceful, open, and done in good faith by a transactional act.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, we can refine it into:
- **B1**: The item was stolen.
- **B2**: The item was lost.
For **A2**, refinement could consider the nature of possession and faith, but given the context, these remain abstract without further specification in the query or articles.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Stolen items fall under stolen or lost property.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): Lost items also constitute stolen or lost property.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): If an item is stolen or lost, it directly supports the victim's right to demand its return.
- (**A2** denies **R1** in certain contexts): Good faith possession might limit the immediate return of the item but doesn't negate the right to demand it back within a specified timeframe.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: A stole the jewelry that B had leased from C, and gave it to D. If D received the actual delivery of the jewelry believing without negligence that it belonged to A, B may demand the return of the jewelry from D within two years from the time of the theft.
- **(query entails B1)** because the query involves a stolen item (jewelry).
- The situation described aligns with **R1** since it involves demanding the return of a stolen item.

### Justification and Rejustification
Upon initial analysis, it appears that:
- The query agrees with **R1** because both involve scenarios where a victim demands the return of stolen property within a specified timeframe.
However, upon reevaluation considering the specifics of the scenario (the involvement of leasing, theft, good faith possession), the core principle remains unchanged: the right to demand return exists for stolen items. Therefore:
- **(query agree R1)**.

The final output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 61
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and query, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 200(1) is that a possessor who is forcibly dispossessed may demand the restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage by filing an action for recovery of possession. Thus, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A possessor who is forcibly dispossessed may demand restitution and compensation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The possession was obtained through force.
- **A2**: The possessor has the right to file an action for recovery of possession.

These abstract factors validate the conclusion by establishing the conditions under which a possessor can demand restitution and compensation.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2** into base-level factors:
- **B1**: The leasing agreement has been terminated, and the lessee refuses to return the item.
- **B2**: The lessor (original possessor) has legal grounds to reclaim the item.

These base-level factors directly apply to specific conditions related to the scenario described in the query.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links:
- (**B1** supports **A1**): The scenario where a leasing agreement is terminated, and the lessee refuses to return the item, supports the condition that possession was obtained through force or is being wrongfully withheld.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): The lessor having legal grounds to reclaim the item supports the possessor's right to file an action for recovery of possession.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): The fact that the possession was forcibly taken or wrongfully withheld supports the conclusion that the possessor may demand restitution and compensation.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): The possessor's right to file an action for recovery of possession also supports this conclusion.

### Justification
Given the query, "A has leased a copying machine owned by A to B, and B has not returned it by using it even after the termination of the lease agreement. In this case, A may demand the return of the copying machine against B by filing an action for recovery of possession," we can justify:
- (**query entails B1**): The query describes a situation where the leasing agreement has been terminated, and the lessee (B) refuses to return the item, which aligns with base-level factor **B1**.
- (**query agree R1**): The query's conclusion that A may demand the return of the copying machine against B by filing an action for recovery of possession agrees with the root node **R1**, which states that a possessor who is forcibly dispossessed (or in this case, wrongfully denied return of their property) may demand restitution and compensation.

After rejustification, considering the specifics of the query and how it aligns with the base-level factors and the root node's conclusion, the assessment remains consistent. The query indeed entails a scenario similar to **B1** and agrees with the verdict presented in **R1**, as both involve a situation where the original possessor seeks legal recourse to reclaim their property after being wrongfully denied its return. 

Therefore, the justified output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)
======== ASP facts conversion step: =======

correct prediction case 62
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 200 is to establish that a possessor who has been forcibly dispossessed may demand restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage by filing an action for recovery of possession. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: A possessor who has been forcibly dispossessed may file an action for recovery of possession.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- A1: The possession was taken forcibly.
- A2: The successor had knowledge of the unlawful taking of possession.

These abstract factors validate or invalidate the conclusion regarding the filing of an action for recovery of possession.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2:
- B1: There is evidence that the possessor was forcibly dispossessed.
- B2: The successor did not have knowledge of the unlawful taking of possession at the time of acquisition.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are established as follows:
- (B1 supports A1): Evidence of forcible dispossession supports the fact that the possession was taken forcibly.
- (A1 supports R1): The fact that the possession was taken forcibly supports the possessor's right to file an action for recovery of possession.
- (B2 supports A2): Lack of knowledge by the successor about the unlawful taking at the time of acquisition supports the condition regarding the successor's knowledge.

Given the query: B stole A's computer with a sticker "Owner A" on the bottom. B transferred the computer to C who does not know the theft, without changing the computer's appearance. In this case, A may not demand the return of the computer by filing an action for recovery of possession.

### Analysis
- (query entails B2): The query mentions that C does not know about the theft, which aligns with B2, indicating a scenario where the successor lacks knowledge.
- However, considering the details and applying them to the structure:
  - A1 is supported because there's an indication of forcible dispossession (theft).
  - Given B stole the computer and C didn't know, B2 is relevant but in this context, it actually supports a condition that might limit direct action against C due to lack of knowledge.
- The query seems to disagree with R1 when stating A may not demand the return by filing an action for recovery of possession. However, upon closer examination:
  - The law (Article 200) specifically allows for an action for recovery of possession if one has been forcibly dispossessed, and it does provide an exception regarding successors' knowledge.
  - Therefore, despite the initial appearance, the scenario described doesn't inherently negate R1 but rather involves considerations around A2 and its base-level factors.

Justifying further:
- The query essentially presents a situation where A's computer was stolen (forcible dispossession), which directly aligns with the premise of Article 200 allowing for an action for recovery.
- The transfer to C, who lacks knowledge, introduces nuances regarding direct action against successors but doesn't negate the principle that A can seek restitution due to the initial forcible dispossession.

Thus, considering the nuances and focusing on the core legal principles presented:
- (query entails B2) is accurate because it deals with a successor lacking knowledge.
- The query's scenario aligns more closely with the spirit of R1 when understanding that the right to file an action for recovery of possession is fundamentally about addressing forcible dispossession, despite the additional considerations around successors and knowledge.

Therefore, upon reevaluation:
- (query disagree R1) might be too simplistic given the context. The query's details highlight complexities but ultimately, the principle that a possessor can seek restitution after forcible dispossession stands, with nuances around how this applies to successors without knowledge.
  
Given the detailed analysis and focusing strictly on the provided format for the final answer:
- (query entails B2)
- Upon careful consideration, it seems there was an initial inclination towards disagreement due to misunderstanding the application of R1 in the context provided. However, recognizing the core principle that a possessor forcibly dispossessed can seek restitution, unless explicitly barred by conditions like those outlined for successors with knowledge:
- (query agree R1) might better reflect the alignment with the legal principle allowing for action after forcible dispossession, despite the nuanced scenario presented involving a successor without knowledge.

wrong prediction case 63
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node is determined by identifying the legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. In Article 200(1), the legal conclusion is that if a possessor is forcibly dispossessed, they may demand the restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage by filing an action for recovery of possession.

- **R1**: A possessor who is forcibly dispossessed may file an action for recovery of possession to demand restitution and compensation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- The possession of the thing by the individual.
- The forcible nature of the dispossession.
- The right to seek legal remedy through an action for recovery of possession.

- **A1**: Forcible dispossession of a possessor supports their right to file an action for recovery of possession.
- **A2**: Legal possession of a thing is a prerequisite for seeking its recovery.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be the specific scenario where the dispossession occurs without the consent of the possessor.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could involve leased items where possession is legally granted to the lessee for a specified period.

- **B1** (under A1): Dispossession by theft supports the right to file an action for recovery of possession.
- **B2** (under A2): Leased property, when stolen from the lessee, entitles the lessee to seek its recovery through legal means.

### 4. Establish Directed Links:
Directed links are established as follows:
- **B1 supports A1**: Theft is a form of forcible dispossession.
- **B2 supports A2**: Leased property is considered in the possession of the lessee during the lease term, thus they have a right to its recovery if stolen.
- **A1 supports R1**: Forcible dispossession directly leads to the right to file an action for recovery of possession.
- **A2 supports R1**: Legal possession is necessary for the right to recover the thing through legal action.

Given the query: A has leased a machine tool owned by A to B, and C stole the machine tool from B within the duration of the lease agreement. In this case, B may file an action for recovery of possession against C independently of A.

### Analysis:
- **(query entails B2)** because both involve scenarios where leased property is stolen from the lessee, focusing on the lessee's right to recover the stolen item.
- Considering the root node R1 and its supporting factors, particularly how they relate to the scenario presented in the query, we observe that the query aligns with the principle established by Article 200(1). The query presents a situation where B, as the possessor of the leased machine tool (albeit temporarily through a lease agreement), is forcibly dispossessed by C. This situation directly corresponds with the conditions outlined under R1 for seeking recovery and compensation.
- Therefore, **(query agree R1)** because both assert that a possessor who has been forcibly dispossessed has the right to file an action for recovery of possession.

Upon reevaluation:
The initial analysis correctly identifies that the query entails B2 due to the shared context of leased property being stolen. It also accurately concludes that the query agrees with R1, as the scenario described fits within the legal framework outlined by Article 200(1) regarding the rights of a forcibly dispossessed possessor to seek recovery and compensation.

Thus, reaffirming:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

This structured approach ensures that the analysis remains grounded in the provided legal provisions and accurately applies them to the given query.

correct prediction case 64
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and query, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article seeks to establish that a person who commences the possession of movables peacefully and openly by a transactional act acquires the rights exercised with respect to the movables immediately if the person possesses it in good faith and without negligence.

- **Root Node (R1):** A person acquires immediate rights to movables possessed peacefully, openly, in good faith, and without negligence.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Peaceful and open possession of movables.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Good faith possession.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Possession without negligence.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining these factors further:

- **Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1:** The possession must be initiated through a recognized transactional act (e.g., purchase, gift).
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) under A2:** The possessor must have no knowledge of any defects in the title at the time of acquisition.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3) under A3:** The possessor must take reasonable care to ensure their possession is lawful and does not infringe on others' rights.

### 4. Establish Directed Links

Directed links will be established as follows:

- **(B1 supports A1):** B1 directly contributes to the condition of peaceful and open possession.
- **(B2 supports A2):** B2 directly upholds the principle of good faith by ensuring the possessor has no knowledge of title defects.
- **(B3 supports A3):** B3 ensures that the possession is without negligence by emphasizing the need for reasonable care.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the query:

"B obtained A's bicycle by fraud. In this case, A may demand the return of the bicycle against B by filing an action for recovery of possession."

### Justification

- The query involves a situation where the possession was not peaceful and open (fraudulent acquisition), which directly contradicts the conditions necessary for acquiring immediate rights as per R1.
- **(query entails B1):** The query considers a scenario where B's method of obtaining the bicycle (by fraud) is contrary to what B1 supports (peaceful and open possession through a recognized transactional act).
  
Considering the directed links and the nature of the query:

- Since B's acquisition by fraud undermines the principles of good faith and peaceful possession, it contradicts the conditions set forth in R1 for acquiring rights to movables.
- **(query disagree R1):** The scenario presented in the query (acquisition by fraud) does not align with the verdict of R1, which requires peaceful, open, good faith, and non-negligent possession.

Upon rejustification:

The initial analysis correctly identifies that the query involves a base-level factor related to the method of acquisition but highlights a disagreement with the root node's conditions due to the fraudulent nature of the transaction. The structure properly represents the legal principles at play, emphasizing the importance of good faith and peaceful acquisition in determining rights over movables.

Thus, the final analysis confirms:

- **(query entails B1):** Because it involves considerations around the method of possession initiation.
- **(query disagree R1):** Due to the fraudulent (and thus not peaceful or open) manner of acquiring the bicycle, which contradicts the conditions for immediate rights acquisition as stated in R1.

correct prediction case 65
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 201 is to establish that an action for maintenance of possession must be filed within a specific timeframe after obstruction stops or under certain conditions related to construction work.
   - **Root Node R1:** "An action for maintenance of possession can be filed."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Key legal factors include the timing of filing the action and the context of obstruction or construction work.
   - **Abstract Factor A1:** "The action is filed within the specified timeframe."
   - **Abstract Factor A2:** "The obstruction or construction work has stopped or reached a completion stage that affects the filing."

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, we refine it based on the specific conditions provided:
     - **Base-Level Factor B1:** "The action is filed during the obstruction."
     - **Base-Level Factor B2:** "The action is filed within one year after the obstruction stops."
     - **Base-Level Factor B3:** "The construction has been completed or more than a year has passed since it started, affecting the filing eligibility."
   - For A2, refinement might not be necessary as it directly pertains to the state of the obstruction or construction work.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **B1 supports A1** because filing during obstruction is within the specified timeframe.
   - **B2 supports A1** since filing within one year after obstruction stops also meets the criteria.
   - **B3 denies A1** because if construction has been completed or more than a year has passed, it may prevent the action from being filed under certain conditions.
   - **A1 supports R1** as filing within the specified timeframe allows for the maintenance of possession action.
   - **A2 supports R1** since the condition of obstruction or construction work stopping or reaching a completion stage is crucial for determining the eligibility to file.

Given the query: "A had owned land in an area of holiday homes. B, who owned neighboring land, began to construct a fence on A's land crossing the boundary without A's consent, and two years later the fence was completed. As of this time, A may not demand the removal of the fence against B by filing an action for maintenance of possession."

- **(query entails B3)** because the scenario involves construction being completed more than a year after it started, which aligns with the conditions described in B3.
- **(query disagree R1)** because, according to the query, A may not demand the removal of the fence (which implies that A cannot file an action for maintenance of possession), contrary to what R1 states under normal circumstances. However, upon closer inspection, this disagreement arises from the specific conditions (completion of construction and the timeframe) that align with B3's scenario, which denies A1, thereby indirectly supporting a conclusion where R1 might not apply due to those specific conditions.

After re-justification, considering the specifics of the query and how it aligns with the base-level factors and their implications on the root node:
- The presence of **(query entails B3)** is confirmed because the construction's completion and the elapsed time directly relate to the conditions outlined in B3.
- The interpretation of **(query disagree R1)** may initially seem accurate due to the query's outcome. However, considering that R1 generally states an action for maintenance of possession can be filed under certain conditions, and B3 (entailed by the query) denies A1 (a condition supporting R1), it actually means the query's scenario leads to a specific instance where R1 does not apply due to the construction completion and timeframe. Thus, the disagreement is contextually based on the specifics of when and how actions can be filed rather than a direct contradiction of the root principle itself.

Therefore, the corrected understanding after thorough justification should reflect that while the query does entail B3, its relationship with R1 is nuanced by the specific conditions outlined in the legal provisions.

wrong prediction case 66
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the query against this framework, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if the duration of superficies is not fixed by the act that established it and there are no relevant customs, the superficiary may waive that right at any time under certain conditions. Thus, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The superficiary may waive the right of superficies at any time if its duration is not fixed and there are no relevant customs.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The absence of a fixed duration for the superficies.
- **A2**: The absence of relevant customs governing the superficies.
- **A3**: The payment of rent and its implications on waiving the right.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- **B1** (under A1): The act establishing the superficies does not specify a duration.
- **B2** (under A1): There are no local customs or agreements that imply a specific duration for the superficies.
- **B3** (under A3): If rent must be paid, giving notice one year in advance or paying rent for one year that has not yet become due and payable is required to waive the right.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The absence of a specified duration in the act supports the abstract factor of an unfixed duration.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: The lack of local customs also supports the notion of no fixed duration.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: An unfixed duration for the superficies supports the conclusion that the superficiary can waive the right at any time under certain conditions.
- **(A3 supports R1)**: The condition related to rent payment (if applicable) also supports this conclusion by outlining specific requirements for waiving the right.

### Evaluating the Query
The query states, "The duration of agreed superficies must be fixed within a duration of 20 years or more but not more than 50 years."

- **(Query entails B1)**: The query does imply a consideration of the duration of superficies, which aligns with the concept of B1 (the act establishing the superficies does not specify a duration). However, it actually suggests a fixed duration, contrary to what B1 directly supports.
  
- Given this analysis, we must evaluate if the query agrees or disagrees with **R1**:
  - **(Query disagree R1)**: The query implies that there should be a fixed duration for superficies between 20 and 50 years, which contradicts the premise of R1 that allows for waiving the right without a specified duration.

Upon reevaluation, it's clear that the query introduces a condition (a specific range for the duration) not directly addressed by R1 or its supporting factors. The core disagreement lies in the query's requirement for a fixed duration versus the scenario described in R1 where no such duration is specified, allowing for flexibility in waiving the right.

Therefore, the correct output based on the analysis is:
- **(Query entails B1)**: This might seem initially true because it discusses duration, but upon closer inspection, the query actually suggests a fixed duration.
- **(Query disagree R1)**: Due to the introduction of a specific duration requirement that contrasts with the flexible waiver conditions outlined in R1.

correct prediction case 67
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article establishes that "A superficiary has the right to use another person's land in order to own structures, or trees or bamboo, on that land." Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A superficiary has the right to use another person's land for owning specific assets (structures, trees, or bamboo).

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors substantiating this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The existence of a superficies agreement or right.
- **A2**: The type of assets allowed under the superficies (e.g., structures, trees, or bamboo).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2**:
- **B1**: The superficiary has a legitimate agreement or legal right to use the land.
- **B2**: The assets in question are of a type permitted by the superficies (structures, trees, or bamboo).

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- (**B1 supports A1**): Having a legitimate agreement supports the existence of a superficies right.
- (**B2 supports A2**): The assets being of a permitted type supports the type of assets allowed under the superficies.
- (**A1 supports R1**): The existence of a superficies agreement supports the superficiary's right to use the land.
- (**A2 supports R1**): The specification of allowed assets supports the superficiary's right to own those assets on the land.

### Justification
Given the query: "Superficies are the rights to use a land in order to own structures, or trees or bamboo."
- This query aligns with the concept presented by **B2**, as it specifies the type of assets (structures, trees, or bamboo) that can be owned under superficies. Therefore, (**query entails B2**).
- The query essentially agrees with the root node's verdict (**R1**) because both assert the right to use land for owning specific types of assets (structures, trees, or bamboo). Thus, (**query agree R1**).

After rejustification, considering the specifics of the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure, it remains clear that the query directly relates to the base-level factor **B2** due to its focus on the type of assets. Moreover, the overall assertion made by the query is in agreement with the root node's conclusion regarding the superficiary's rights.

Therefore, the final justification confirms:
- (**query entails B2**)
- (**query agree R1**)

correct prediction case 68
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided article, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 269-2 is to establish that an underground space or airspace may be set up as the subject matter of superficies for ownership of structures through specifying upper and lower extents. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: An underground space or airspace can be established as the subject matter of superficies for ownership of structures.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Specification of upper and lower extents is possible.
- **A2**: Restrictions on land use can be added to facilitate the exercise of superficies.

These abstract factors validate the conclusion by providing the means through which an underground space or airspace can be established for superficies.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
- **B1**: The technology and legal framework exist to accurately specify upper and lower extents of underground spaces or airspaces.
For **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
- **B2**: There are precedents or legal mechanisms for adding restrictions on land use that do not violate property rights.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Given the nature of these factors, we can establish the following directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The existence of technology and legal frameworks to specify extents supports the possibility of doing so.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The presence of precedents or mechanisms for adding restrictions supports the feasibility of such actions.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The ability to specify upper and lower extents supports the establishment of underground spaces or airspaces as superficies subjects.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The possibility of adding use restrictions facilitates the exercise of superficies, thus supporting the root conclusion.

### Justification
Given the query "An underground space or airspace may be established as the subject matter of superficies for ownership of structures, through the specification of upper and lower extents," we can see that it directly aligns with the conditions described by **B1** and implicitly supports the notion presented in **R1**. The query does not directly mention restrictions on land use (**A2** or **B2**), but its focus is on the establishment process, which is central to **R1**.

- **(query entails B1)**: Because the query implies that specifying upper and lower extents is a viable method for establishing superficies over underground spaces or airspaces.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query directly agrees with the root node's conclusion regarding the establishment of superficies over such spaces.

Upon rejustification, considering the steps and the structure formed, it's clear that the query aligns closely with the factors supporting the establishment of superficies over underground spaces or airspaces. Thus, the initial justification stands as a correct interpretation of how the query relates to the constructed ANGELIC structure.

correct prediction case 69
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided article and query, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of the article is that to preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables, the budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same. This can be stated as:
- R1: Registration of budgeted expenses before starting construction work preserves the effectiveness of statutory liens.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: The requirement for prior registration of budgeted expenses.
- A2: The consequence of exceeding the budgeted amount on the statutory lien.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

For A1, a base-level factor could be:
- B1: Timely registration of budgeted expenses before construction commencement.
For A2, a base-level factor could be:
- B2: The excess amount over the registered budget does not benefit from the statutory lien.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 denies R1 in cases where expenses exceed the budgeted amount

Given the query: "In order to preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens for construction work for immovables, the budgeted expenses of the construction work must be registered prior to the commencement of the same."

### Justification

The query directly aligns with the Root Node R1. It essentially states the same requirement for preserving the effectiveness of statutory liens as outlined in R1.

- (query entails B1) because both consider the importance of registering budgeted expenses before construction starts.
- (query agree R1) because both assert that prior registration of budgeted expenses is necessary to preserve the effectiveness of statutory liens.

Upon rejustification, considering the context and the specifics of the query in relation to the constructed ANGELIC structure, it's clear that the query directly supports the root node without introducing any conditions that would lead to a denial or disagreement. Thus, the justification holds true after reconsideration.

correct prediction case 70
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, we first need to construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the query against this structure.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article states that "No mortgage is extinguished by prescription in relation to obligors and mortgagors unless it is extinguished simultaneously with the claim the mortgage secures." The root node, therefore, can be defined as:
- R1: A mortgage cannot be extinguished by prescription independently of the claim it secures.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The existence of a registered mortgage creation.
- A2: The passage of time (specifically, 20 years) for prescription to apply.
- A3: The status of the claim secured by the mortgage.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- B1 (supports A1): Registration of the mortgage creation is a prerequisite for its validity.
- B2 (supports A2): The prescription period of 20 years must have elapsed since the mortgage became exercisable.
- B3 (supports A3): The claim secured by the mortgage remains valid and has not been extinguished.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links include:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3
- A1, A2, and A3 support R1

Given this structure, we analyze the query: "A may assert the extinctive prescription of the mortgage if 20 years have passed from the time when it becomes exercisable, even if the claim the mortgage secures is not extinguished."

### Justification
The query directly relates to the concept of prescription and its conditions, specifically the time frame (20 years) and the status of the secured claim. This scenario aligns with Base-Level Factor B2, as both consider the 20-year prescription period.

However, the query seems to contradict the root node R1 because it suggests that a mortgage can be extinguished by prescription even if the claim it secures is not extinguished, which directly opposes the statement in Article 396.

### Conclusion
- The query entails B2 because both consider the scenario where 20 years have passed since the mortgage became exercisable.
- However, upon closer examination, the query actually disagrees with R1. This is because R1 stipulates that a mortgage cannot be extinguished by prescription unless the claim it secures is also extinguished, whereas the query posits a situation where the mortgage can be extinguished despite the claim remaining valid.

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

correct prediction case 71
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this framework, let's follow the steps outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome or verdict that Article 398-11 seeks to establish is that before the principal is crystallized, a revolving mortgagee may not dispose of a revolving mortgage under certain conditions, but there are exceptions for applying it to secure other claims.

- **Root Node (R1):** "A revolving mortgagee cannot dispose of a revolving mortgage before the principal is crystallized except for securing other claims."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors here involve the rights and limitations of a revolving mortgagee before the principal is crystallized.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** "Limitations on disposing of a revolving mortgage before principal crystallization."
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** "Exceptions for securing other claims."

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
For A1 and A2, we can refine them further:

- Under A1: 
  - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** "Prohibition on assignment or waiver of a revolving mortgage before principal crystallization."
  - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** "Restrictions on applying the mortgage to secure other claims before principal crystallization, except as provided."

- Under A2:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** "Allowance for applying a revolving mortgage to secure other claims before principal crystallization."

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The prohibition on assignment or waiver directly supports the limitations on disposing of a revolving mortgage.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: Restrictions on applying the mortgage also support the general limitation principle.
- **(B3 supports A2)**: The allowance for securing other claims supports the exception principle.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The general limitations support the root conclusion about restricted disposal before crystallization.
- **(A2 denies R1 partially)**: The exceptions partially deny or modify the absolute nature of the restriction in the root node, allowing for some forms of disposition.

### Query Evaluation:
Given the query "An obligee (B) may assign the order of priority of a mortgage to another obligee(C) of obligator (A) before the principal is crystallized," let's analyze:

- This scenario involves assigning or modifying the order of priority, which relates to disposing of or altering the mortgage's terms.
- The query essentially touches on whether such an action is permissible before the principal is crystallized.

### Justification:
- **(query entails B1)**: Because the query discusses assignment (a form of disposition) before crystallization, it directly pertains to the prohibition or limitations outlined in B1.
- Considering the specifics of Article 398-11 and the general principles of mortgage law as provided, the query seems to challenge or seek clarification on the root node's assertion about restricted disposal before principal crystallization.

### Agreement with Root Node:
Given that R1 posits a general restriction with exceptions for securing other claims, and considering the query involves assignment (which could be seen as disposition), there might initially seem to be a disagreement. However, upon closer examination:

- **(query disagree R1)**: The query suggests a scenario where an obligee may assign priority, which could imply a form of disposition or alteration of the mortgage's terms before crystallization, potentially disagreeing with the absolute restriction stated in R1 unless this falls under the exception for securing other claims.

### Rejustification:
Upon reevaluation, recognizing that Article 398-11 does allow for applying the revolving mortgage to secure other claims before principal crystallization as an exception, if the query's scenario involves such an application (securing another claim by adjusting priority), it could actually align with the exceptions provided rather than directly disagreeing with R1. Thus, the initial disagreement might be nuanced based on how one interprets "assigning the order of priority" in relation to securing other claims.

However, sticking strictly to the format and the initial analysis without overcomplicating the query's intent:

The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B1)}$

retrying...  failed
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined in the prompt.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The Root Node is determined by identifying the legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish or refute. Given Article 398-6 and Article 398-4, the primary focus is on the conditions and procedures for changing the principal crystallization date of a revolving mortgage and the scope of claims secured by it. The key legal conclusion here revolves around whether changes to a revolving mortgage's terms require the consent of subordinated mortgagees.

Root Node (R1): Changes to a revolving mortgage, including the crystallization date, do not necessarily require the consent of a subordinated mortgagee.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. 

- A1: The necessity of obtaining approval from third parties, including subordinated mortgagees, for changes to the revolving mortgage.
- A2: The legal provisions governing the timing and registration of changes to a revolving mortgage.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific base-level factors:

- B1 (under A1): The consent requirement for subordinated mortgagees in the context of changing the principal crystallization date.
- B2 (under A2): The registration requirements and deadlines for effecting changes to a revolving mortgage.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links between factors:

- (B1 denies A1) because, according to Article 398-4(2), obtaining the approval of third parties including subordinated mortgagees is not required for changing the scope of claims secured by a revolving mortgage.
- (A1 denies R1) since if A1 were true (requiring consent), it would contradict the root conclusion that changes do not necessarily require consent.
- (B2 supports A2) as it specifies conditions under which changes can be legally recognized.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "Suppose that obligator (A) sets a mortgage on his real estate for obligee (B). If there is a subordinated mortgagee(F), in order for A and B to effect the changes of the principal crystallization date of the revolving mortgage, the consent of F must be obtained."

- The query entails B1 because it directly addresses the scenario where consent from a subordinated mortgagee is considered necessary for changing the terms of a revolving mortgage.
- However, considering the legal provisions provided (Article 398-4(2)), which state that changes do not require the approval of third parties including subordinated mortgagees, the query disagrees with R1. The root conclusion established from the articles suggests that such consent is not necessary.

### Justification
Upon initial analysis, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in directly applying the provided legal framework to the query without considering the specific conditions and exceptions outlined in the articles. 

Re-justifying the answer:
- (query entails B1) because both consider scenarios involving the necessity of consent from subordinated mortgagees for changes in mortgage terms.
- However, given that Article 398-4(2) explicitly states that obtaining approval from third parties is not required, this directly contradicts the premise of the query which assumes consent must be obtained. Therefore, (query disagrees R1), as the root conclusion based on the articles suggests changes can occur without needing such consent.

Corrected Final Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 412-2 seeks to establish that if the performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the contract or other sources of claims and common sense in the transaction, the obligee may not request the performance of the obligation. Thus, the root node can be defined as:

- **R1**: The impossibility of performing an obligation renders the obligee unable to request its performance.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Impossibility of performance at the time of contract formation.
- **A2**: Common sense and transactional context making performance impossible.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining **A1** and **A2** into more specific scenarios:
- **B1**: Impossibility due to unforeseen events occurring before contract conclusion.
- **B2**: Impossibility evident at the time of contract formation.
- **B3**: Transactional context or common sense rendering performance impractical.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- (**B1** supports **A1**): Because if an unforeseen event like a fire occurs before the contract is concluded, it supports the notion that the impossibility was present at the formation.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): Directly stating that if the impossibility is clear at the time of contract formation, it supports the abstract factor of initial impossibility.
- (**B3** supports **A2**): As common sense or transactional context would make performance impractical, thus supporting this abstract factor.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): If the performance is impossible from the start, it logically supports that the obligee cannot request its performance.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): The impossibility due to common sense or transactional context also supports the root conclusion.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "The contract for sale does not become effective in the case where X is burned down the day before the day of the conclusion of the contract."

- (**query entails B1**): Because the scenario described (X being burned down) is an unforeseen event occurring before contract conclusion, which aligns with **B1**.
  
Considering **R1**, the query essentially states a situation where due to an impossibility (the burning down of X), the contract cannot proceed as intended. This situation aligns with the idea that if performance is impossible, the obligee may not request it.

- (**query agree R1**): The query and **R1** agree on the verdict in a comparable situation. Both suggest that when an obligation becomes impossible (due to events like the one described), the contract's effectiveness or the request for performance can be impacted.

Upon rejustification, considering the directed links and the nature of the query, it appears the initial assessment is correct: the query aligns with **B1** due to its scenario-specific details about an unforeseen event impacting contract feasibility. Moreover, this alignment supports the broader conclusion encapsulated in **R1**, indicating agreement on how impossibility affects contractual obligations.

Therefore, the final analysis confirms:
- (**query entails B1**)
- (**query agree R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this framework, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 422-2, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The obligee may demand the transfer of the right or reimbursement of the profit from the obligor if the obligor acquires a substitute for the subject matter due to the same cause rendering performance impossible.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that validate or invalidate the conclusion:
- **A1**: The obligor has acquired a right or profit as a substitute for the subject matter of the obligation.
- **A2**: The acquisition is due to the same cause that rendered the performance of the obligation impossible.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1** and **A2**, we can refine them further:
- Under **A1**:
  - **B1**: The subject matter of the obligation has been destroyed or otherwise rendered unusable.
  - **B2**: The obligor receives insurance money for the damage caused by the destruction of the subject matter.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: The cause of the destruction is attributable to the buyer.
  - **B4**: The acquisition of the right or profit (e.g., insurance money) is directly related to the same cause.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Destruction of the subject matter supports the condition for substitute acquisition.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): Receipt of insurance money supports the obligor having acquired a right or profit as a substitute.
- (**B3** supports **A2**): The cause being attributable to the buyer supports the same cause condition.
- (**B4** supports **A2**): Direct relation between acquisition and cause supports the same cause condition.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Acquisition of a right or profit supports the obligee's demand for transfer or reimbursement.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): Same cause condition supports the obligee's demand.

### Evaluation of the Query
Given the query: "If, after the conclusion of the contract for sale, a buyer (B) pays 1000000 yen for X, but before a seller (A) delivers X to B, X is burned-out due to grounds attributable to B, and A obtains 700,000 yen of the insurance money for damage caused by the destruction of X, B may claim payment of 700,000 yen to A."

- **(query entails B2)**: The query mentions A obtaining insurance money (700,000 yen) for the damage, which aligns with **B2**.
- **(query entails B3)**: The destruction is due to grounds attributable to B, aligning with **B3**.

### Agreement with Root Node
Given that the query involves a situation where the seller (A) obtains insurance money due to the buyer's (B) attributive actions leading to the destruction of X, and considering the framework established:
- **(query agree R1)**: The query scenario aligns with the conditions outlined in **R1**, as B may indeed claim reimbursement for the amount A received from insurance, up to the damage sustained.

Upon reevaluation, this conclusion remains consistent because the structure supports the idea that if an obligor (in this case, the seller) receives compensation (insurance money) due to the same cause (attributable to the buyer) that made the obligation impossible, the obligee (the buyer) can claim reimbursement for the profit acquired by the obligor, up to the amount of damage sustained. Thus, the query aligns with **R1**, supporting the conclusion that B may claim payment from A under the described circumstances.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and query, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 536(1) is that if the performance of an obligation becomes impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, the obligee may refuse to perform counter-performance. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The debt to pay the price is extinguished by operation of law when the performance of an obligation becomes impossible.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **A1**: Impossibility of Performance - The performance of the obligation becoming impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party.
- **A2**: Attribution of Grounds - The grounds for impossibility being not attributable to either party.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, we can refine it further into:
- **B1**: External Causes Beyond Control - The performance becomes impossible due to external causes beyond the control of both parties, such as natural disasters or actions by third parties.
For **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
- **B2**: Lack of Negligence by Parties - Neither party is found to have been negligent in causing the impossibility.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1** supports **A1**) because external causes beyond control directly lead to the impossibility of performance.
- (**B2** supports **A2**) since lack of negligence by parties is essential for attributing grounds not to either party.
- (**A1** supports **R1**) as the impossibility of performance due to non-attributable grounds leads to the debt being extinguished.
- (**A2** supports **R1**) because if the grounds are not attributable to either party, it further justifies the extinction of the debt.

### Justification
Given the query: "If, after the conclusion of the contract for sale and before A delivers X to B, X is burned down caused by negligence of a third party, the debt to pay the price of B is extinguished by operation of law."
- The query entails **B1** because both scenarios involve an external cause (a third party's negligence leading to the destruction of X) beyond the control of the contracting parties.
- Considering **R1**, the query agrees with **R1**. Both state that under conditions where the performance becomes impossible due to non-attributable grounds, the debt is extinguished by operation of law.

### Output
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

This structured approach aligns the legal provisions and the query within the ANGELIC framework, demonstrating how external causes leading to impossibility support the extinction of debt as per Article 536(1).

wrong prediction case 76
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the problem, let's break it down into steps according to the provided framework.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 567 is that if the seller delivers or tenders the subject matter and it is lost or damaged due to grounds not attributable to either party, the buyer may not demand cure, reduction of price, claim compensation, or cancel the contract. Specifically, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The buyer may not refuse to pay the price if the seller has delivered or tendered the subject matter in accordance with the contract and it is lost or damaged due to grounds not attributable to either party.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
- **A1**: Delivery or tender of the subject matter by the seller.
- **A2**: Loss or damage of the subject matter due to grounds not attributable to either party.
- **A3**: Buyer's refusal to accept without a legitimate reason.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Further refining:
- **B1** (under A1): The seller delivers the subject matter that conforms to the terms of the contract.
- **B2** (under A1): The seller tenders the performance of the obligation of delivery, but the buyer refuses or is unable to accept.
- **B3** (under A2): Loss or damage due to gross negligence of one party.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- (**B1 supports A1**)
- (**B2 supports A1**)
- (**B3 denies A2**) because gross negligence can be attributed to a party.
- (**A1 supports R1**)
- (**A2 supports R1**)
- (**A3 supports R1**)

### Query Analysis
Given the query: If A tenders the performance of the obligation of delivery of X and B refuses to accept without a legitimate reason, and X is lost due to gross negligence of A while in custody of X by A, B may not refuse to pay the price.
- This scenario involves **B2** (seller's tender) and **A3** (buyer's refusal without a legitimate reason), but it introduces **B3** (loss due to gross negligence of one party).
- (**query entails B2**) because it discusses the seller's tender of delivery.
- (**query entails B3**) because it involves loss due to gross negligence.

### Agreement with Root Node
The query seems to agree with the outcome in a similar situation where the buyer may not refuse to pay if the conditions are met as per Article 567. However, the introduction of "gross negligence of A" complicates this because it means the loss is attributable to one party (A), which contradicts the conditions under which the buyer may not refuse payment according to Article 567.
- Therefore, (**query disagree R1**) because the query introduces a condition (gross negligence) that changes the applicability of R1.

After careful consideration and rejustification:
The conclusion stands. The introduction of gross negligence as the cause for the loss or damage shifts the responsibility back to one party (in this case, A), which under Article 567, means B could potentially refuse payment due to the conditions not being fully met as described in the article.

Thus, the final answer is: 
- (**query entails B2**)
- (**query entails B3**)
- (**query disagree R1**)

correct prediction case 77
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node is the outcome or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 424-7, the primary concern is with actions concerning demands for rescission of fraudulent acts and the parties involved in such actions. Thus, a possible root node could be:
- **R1:** In an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act, specific persons must stand as defendants.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. From Article 424-7, we can identify:
- **A1:** The category of the party against whom the demand for rescission is made (e.g., beneficiary or subsequent acquirer).
- **A2:** The requirement for notice to be given to the obligor when an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act is filed by the obligee.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors helps in applying them to specific conditions. For **A1**, we can refine it as follows:
- **B1:** The beneficiary must be stood as a defendant in an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act against the beneficiary.
- **B2:** The subsequent acquirer must be stood as a defendant in an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act against the subsequent acquirer.

For **A2**, we can refine it as:
- **B3:** The obligee must give notice to the obligor without delay when filing an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Each abstract factor supports the root node, and each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor.
- (**A1** supports **R1**)
- (**A2** supports **R1**)
- (**B1** supports **A1**)
- (**B2** supports **A1**)
- (**B3** supports **A2**)

### Justification of Query Against the Structure:
Given the query: "In the case that an obligee (C) files an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act, an obligor (A) must be stood as a defendant."
- This scenario directly relates to the requirement for notice to be given to the obligor when an action is filed, which aligns with **B3**. However, the query seems to misunderstand the roles as defined by Article 424-7, specifically in identifying who stands as a defendant in such actions.
- The query entails **B3** because it involves an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act and the role of the obligor, but it misinterprets the standing of parties according to Article 424-7.

Regarding agreement with the root node:
- The query seems to agree with **R1** in that specific persons must stand as defendants in actions concerning demands for rescission of fraudulent acts. However, it inaccurately specifies who those persons are based on the roles given (obligee and obligor).

### Rejustification:
Upon reevaluation, considering the specific details provided in Article 424-7 and the query's focus on the obligor's role when an obligee files an action:
- The query indeed relates to the notice requirement (**B3**) but does not accurately reflect the determination of who stands as a defendant based on the categories outlined in Article 424-7.
- Thus, while the query touches upon aspects related to **R1** (regarding standing as defendants), it does so with an apparent misunderstanding of how the roles of obligee and obligor relate to the demand for rescission of fraudulent acts.

Given this analysis:
- (**query entails B3**)
- The query seems to have a misunderstanding regarding who should be stood as a defendant, which aligns more closely with disagreeing on the specifics of **R1**, given its apparent misinterpretation of roles. However, since it touches upon the concept of actions for rescission and the involvement of parties, there's an aspect of agreement but based on incorrect premises.
- Therefore, a precise alignment in terms of agreement or disagreement with **R1** requires clarifying that the query does not accurately represent the legal conclusion as per Article 424-7 regarding who stands as a defendant. 

Thus, considering the structure and the provided query:
- (**query entails B3**) because it involves an obligee filing an action and mentions an obligor.
- The interpretation of agreement or disagreement with **R1** is nuanced due to the query's misalignment with Article 424-7's specifics on standing as defendants. However, if forced into the provided format without further clarification:
- (**query disagree R1**) might be a closer representation due to the misunderstanding in the roles and application of Article 424-7 principles.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 424 and its subsections is to establish when an obligee may demand rescission of an act that prejudices them, specifically focusing on acts involving a beneficiary and subsequent acquirers. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** An obligee can demand rescission of an act prejudicial to them under certain conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** Knowledge of the beneficiary about the prejudice to the obligee.
- **A2:** Conditions under which a subsequent acquirer can be held liable for rescission.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2, we get:
- **B1:** The subsequent acquirer knows that the act will prejudice the obligee at the time of acquisition from the beneficiary.
- **B2:** In cases of multiple subsequent acquisitions, all previous acquirers knew about the prejudicial nature of the act.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A2):** Knowing the prejudice at the time of acquisition directly supports the conditions for liability.
- **(B2 supports A2):** Knowledge throughout the chain of acquisitions supports the conditions for liability in cases of multiple subsequent acquirers.
- **(A1 denies R1):** If the beneficiary does not know about the prejudice, it undermines the basis for demanding rescission.
- **(A2 supports R1):** Conditions being met for subsequent acquirers support the obligee's right to demand rescission.

Given the query: "If beneficiary (B) sells and delivers X to a subsequent acquirer (D), who knows that the gifts of X will prejudice the obligee of A, C may claim to D to rescind the sale between B and D."

- **(query entails B1):** The query involves a scenario where the subsequent acquirer (D) knows about the prejudice at the time of acquisition, which aligns with Base-Level Factor B1.
- **(query agree R1):** The query presents a situation where the conditions for demanding rescission are met (knowledge of prejudice by the subsequent acquirer), which agrees with the root node's conclusion that an obligee can demand rescission under certain conditions.

After careful consideration, the analysis holds because the query directly addresses a scenario covered by the legal provisions outlined in Article 424 and its subsections, specifically focusing on the knowledge of subsequent acquirers as a condition for demanding rescission. 

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 79
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 424(1) is that an obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing it will prejudice the obligee. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: An obligee can demand the court to rescind a prejudicial act.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- A1: The obligor's knowledge of the act's prejudicial effect on the obligee.
- A2: The beneficiary's knowledge of the act's prejudicial effect on the obligee at the time of the act.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2:
- B1 (refining A1): The obligor is aware that their action will prejudice the obligee.
- B2 (refining A2): The beneficiary is unaware that the act will prejudice the obligee at the time of the act.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 denies R1

Given the query: "If B sells and delivers X to D, who knows that the gift of X will prejudice the obligee of A, C may claim to B to rescind the gift between A and B."

### Justification
The query involves a scenario where there is knowledge about the prejudicial effect on the obligee. Here:
- (query entails B1) because both involve scenarios where someone is aware that an action will prejudice the obligee.
  
Given this, we need to assess whether the query agrees or disagrees with R1.

### Agreement/Disagreement with Root Node
The root node R1 states that an obligee can demand the court to rescind a prejudicial act. The query presents a scenario where C (potentially an obligee or acting on behalf of one) seeks to rescind a gift due to its prejudicial effect, which aligns with the principle behind R1.

Thus, considering the comparable situation:
- (query agree R1)

Upon reevaluation, this assessment holds because both the query and R1 deal with scenarios where an act's prejudicial effects on an obligee are grounds for seeking its rescission. The presence of knowledge about these effects supports the action to rescind, aligning with the legal principle outlined in Article 424(1). 

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the query against this framework, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article concludes that "a final and binding judgment upholding demand for rescission of fraudulent act is effective against the obligor and all obligees." Thus, the root node (R) can be determined as:
- **R1**: A final and binding judgment upholding demand for rescission of a fraudulent act is effective against all parties involved.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The existence of a fraudulent act.
- **A2**: The issuance of a final and binding judgment demanding the rescission of the fraudulent act.
These abstract factors validate the conclusion by establishing the grounds for the judgment's effectiveness.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, we can refine it further:
- **B1**: The fraudulent act was committed by one party against another, directly affecting their legal obligations.
For **A2**:
- **B2**: The judgment was issued after a thorough examination of the evidence and legal arguments presented by all parties involved.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
The directed links can be established as follows:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The existence of a direct victim of fraud supports the notion that there was indeed a fraudulent act.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The thorough examination of evidence in reaching the judgment supports its final and binding nature.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The acknowledgment of a fraudulent act supports the effectiveness of the judgment against all parties.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The issuance of a final and binding judgment directly supports its effectiveness.

### Evaluating the Query
The query states, "A final and binding judgment upholding demand for rescission of fraudulent act of C is effective against all obligees of A." To evaluate whether this query entails base-level factors or agrees/disagrees with the root node:

- The query essentially discusses a scenario where a fraudulent act's rescission is demanded through a final and binding judgment, which aligns closely with **B1** (considering "C" as the perpetrator and "A" as the affected party) because it involves a specific situation of fraud affecting legal obligations.
- Thus, **(query entails B1)**.

Considering the root node **R1**, the query agrees that a final and binding judgment for rescission due to fraudulent acts is effective against all parties involved (in this case, all obligees of A). Therefore:
- **(query agree R1)**.

After re-evaluation, these conclusions remain consistent with the provided framework and query analysis. 

**Output:**
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 81
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 425-4 seeks to establish that if an act done by the obligor is rescinded by a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act made against the subsequent acquirer, the subsequent acquirer may exercise specific rights under certain conditions.

- **Root Node (R1):** The subsequent acquirer has the right to demand return of the counter-performance or reimbursement of its value from the obligor if the act is rescinded due to fraudulent acts affecting the beneficiary's interests.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

Abstract factors that either substantiate or undermine this legal conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The act was indeed conducted in a manner that prejudices the beneficiary, potentially rendering it a fraudulent act against the beneficiary.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The subsequent acquirer had knowledge of the potential prejudice to the beneficiary at the time of acquisition.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1 and A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The act involved selling and delivering property (X) with the knowledge that such gifts would prejudice the obligee.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** A judgment upholding a demand for rescission of a fraudulent act has become final and binding, indicating the act's prejudicial nature.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- **(A1 supports R1)**: Knowing that an act prejudices the beneficiary supports the subsequent acquirer's right to demand return or reimbursement.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The specific scenario of selling and delivering X with knowledge of prejudice supports the abstract factor of the act being potentially fraudulent against the beneficiary.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: If the subsequent acquirer had knowledge, it strengthens their case for demanding return or reimbursement.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: A final judgment on a related rescission demand supports the notion that the acquirer's knowledge of potential prejudice is significant.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "If B sells and delivers X to D, who knows that the gifts of X will prejudice the obligee of A and judgment upholding demand for rescission of fraudulent act of C has become final and binding, D may demand the return of the price from B."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query directly involves selling and delivering property with knowledge of prejudicing the beneficiary, aligning with Base-Level Factor B1.
- **(query agrees R1)**: Both the query and Root Node R1 conclude that the subsequent acquirer (D in the query) has the right to demand return or reimbursement under similar conditions, indicating agreement.

After careful consideration and re-justification:
- The structure aligns with the legal principles outlined, focusing on the rights of subsequent acquirers in cases involving fraudulent acts against beneficiaries.
- The query directly relates to Base-Level Factor B1 by involving a scenario where property is sold and delivered with knowledge of its prejudicial effect on the beneficiary.
- Both the query and Root Node R1 support the notion that under specific conditions, a demand for return or reimbursement can be made, indicating agreement in their verdicts regarding comparable situations.

**Output:**
- (query entails B1)
- (query agrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's first analyze the provided legal provisions and construct the ANGELIC structure step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of these articles collectively seeks to establish how obligations are affected among joint and several obligors when certain legal actions or changes occur. Specifically, a key conclusion is about what happens when there's a novation, set-off, merger, or other circumstances affecting one of the obligors.

**Root Node (R1):** The obligation among joint and several obligors can be extinguished or modified under specific conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion about obligations among joint and several obligors.
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Novation between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee affects the obligation.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Set-off invoked by one of the joint and several obligors against the obligee affects the obligation.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee affects the obligation.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For each abstract factor, we can refine them further:
- Under A1 (Novation):
  - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** If novation occurs between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee, it extinguishes the claim for all.
- Under A2 (Set-off):
  - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** When a set-off is invoked by one of the joint and several obligors against the obligee, it extinguishes the claim for all.
- Under A3 (Merger):
  - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** If there's a merger between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee, the obligation is deemed performed.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Each abstract factor supports or denies the root node (R1). Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor.
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**
- **(B3 supports A3)**

### Analysis of Query
The query discusses a scenario where an obligee files an action concerning demand for performance of an obligation, and the judgment upholding the demand has become final and binding. It mentions that neither the obligee nor one of the obligors manifests a particular intention, leading to a new period of extinctive prescription commencing.

This scenario does not directly fall under the specific conditions described in the articles (novation, set-off, merger) but rather deals with the effect of a judgment on the prescription period. However, it touches upon how obligations are affected by legal actions or changes, which aligns with the broader theme of R1.

### Justification
- **(query entails B1):** No, because the query does not directly involve novation between an obligor and the obligee.
- **(query agrees R1):** Yes, in a broad sense. The query implies that legal actions (like judgments) can affect obligations among joint and several obligors, which aligns with the idea that specific conditions can modify or extinguish these obligations.

Upon rejustification, considering the context of the ANGELIC structure and the specifics of the query:
- The query does indeed touch upon how obligations are affected by legal outcomes (like a judgment becoming final), which is in line with the principle that obligations among joint and several obligors can be modified or extinguished under certain conditions.
- However, it introduces a concept (extinctive prescription) not directly addressed by the provided articles but still relevant to how obligations evolve over time.

Given this analysis, the output remains consistent with the initial assessment regarding agreement with R1.

correct prediction case 83
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node should represent a clear legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Based on Article 441, a suitable root node could be:
- **R1**: Any circumstances which have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors are not effective in relation to other joint and several obligors.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
These factors should validate or invalidate the conclusion represented by the root node. From the articles, we can derive:
- **A1**: Manifestation of a different intention by the obligee and one of the joint and several obligors.
- **A2**: Novation between one of the joint and several obligors and the obligee.
- **A3**: Invocation of set-off by one of the joint and several obligors against the obligee.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining **A1**, we have:
- **B1**: The obligee manifests an intention to release another obligor from the obligation.
- **B2**: One of the joint and several obligors manifests a different intention regarding their obligation.

For **A2** and **A3**, no further refinement is necessary as they are already specific conditions.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- (**B1 supports A1**): The manifestation of an intention to release another obligor directly supports the concept of manifesting a different intention.
- (**B2 supports A1**): Similarly, one of the joint and several obligors showing a different intention regarding their obligation supports **A1**.
- (**A1 denies R1**): If there is a manifestation of a different intention, it can deny or override the general rule that circumstances affecting one obligor do not affect others.
- (**A2 denies R1**): Novation between one obligor and the obligee can extinguish the claim for all joint and several obligors, thus denying **R1**.
- (**A3 denies R1**): Invocation of set-off by one obligor against the obligee can also lead to the extinction of the claim for all obligors, denying **R1**.

### Justification:
Given the query: "In the case that D manifests the intention to release another obligor (C) from the obligation to D, even if neither D nor B manifests a particular intention, D may not claim the payment of 600,000 to another obligor (A)."

- (**query entails B1**): The scenario involves D manifesting an intention to release C, which aligns with **B1**, the obligee manifesting an intention to release another obligor.
  
Considering the directed links and the query's alignment with **B1**, we then evaluate if this leads to agreement or disagreement with **R1**. Since **A1** (manifestation of a different intention) denies **R1** (circumstances affecting one obligor not affecting others), and **B1** supports **A1**, the query essentially presents a scenario where an exception to **R1** applies.

- (**query agree R1**): However, upon closer examination, the query actually aligns with an exception to the general rule stated by **R1**, rather than directly agreeing or disagreeing with it. The manifestation of intention (as per **B1**) leads to a specific outcome where D cannot claim payment from A, which indirectly supports the idea that specific circumstances (like manifestation of intention) can alter the general applicability of **R1**.

Upon reevaluation:
The correct interpretation should focus on whether the query aligns with or contradicts the root node's general principle. Given that **B1** supports an exception (**A1**) to the rule stated by **R1**, and considering the specific scenario presented, it seems there was an initial misunderstanding in directly applying the agreement or disagreement without accounting for the nuances of how **A1** (and by extension **B1**) interacts with **R1**.

Thus, the query actually presents a scenario where an exception applies, meaning it does not straightforwardly agree or disagree with **R1** but rather illustrates a condition under which **R1**'s general applicability is modified. However, since this modification (through **A1** and **B1**) essentially leads to a denial of the absolute nature of **R1**, one could argue that in the context provided:

- (**query disagree R1**): In the sense that it presents an exception to the rule, thereby not supporting the general statement as universally applicable.

This nuanced interpretation highlights the complexity of legal reasoning and the importance of carefully considering how different factors interact within the structure of legal arguments.

correct prediction case 84
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this framework, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 439, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A joint and several obligor may refuse to perform an obligation to the extent of another joint and several obligor's share if the latter has a claim against the obligee but does not invoke a set-off.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the root legal conclusion. For Article 439:
- **A1**: The existence of a claim by one joint and several obligor against the obligee.
- **A2**: The invocation or non-invocation of a set-off by the joint and several obligor with a claim against the obligee.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we can refine it to:
  - **B1**: The joint and several obligor has a valid claim against the obligee.
  - **B2**: The amount of the claim is sufficient to cover part or all of the obligation owed by other joint and several obligors.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B3**: The decision not to invoke a set-off affects the rights of other joint and several obligors.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Establishing directed links:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Having a valid claim supports the existence of a claim.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: The sufficiency of the claim amount supports the practical application of the claim.
- **(B3 supports A2)**: The decision not to invoke a set-off directly impacts the scenario described by A2.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The existence of a claim by one joint and several obligor supports the root conclusion about refusal to perform an obligation.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: Not invoking a set-off could deny or limit the right of other joint and several obligors to refuse performance, thus attacking the root conclusion.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "If D owes C a debt (Y) of 300000 yen that is set off against the debt (X), and D demands payment of 600000 yen from A while C does not use a set-off for the debt (Y), A may refuse to pay 200000 yen of that debt."

- **(query entails B2)**: The query involves a specific amount (300000 yen) which is part of the obligation, similar to B2 discussing the sufficiency of the claim amount.
- **(query agrees R1)**: The scenario in the query aligns with the root conclusion (R1), as A is allowed to refuse payment up to the extent of D's share (implied by the context that D owes C and this affects A's obligation), given that C does not invoke a set-off for debt Y.

Justifying the agreement between the query and R1:
- Both involve a situation where one joint and several obligor (D in the query, analogous to the obligor with a claim in Article 439) has a claim against the obligee (C), but this claim is not being used as a set-off.
- The query specifies that A may refuse to pay part of the debt (200000 yen out of 600000 yen demanded by D), which directly corresponds to the principle outlined in R1, where an obligor can refuse performance up to the extent of another's share if that other has a claim against the obligee but doesn't invoke a set-off.

Upon careful reconsideration, this analysis remains consistent with the principles outlined in Article 439 and the constructed ANGELIC structure. The query does indeed entail a base-level factor (B2) concerning the sufficiency of the claim amount to affect obligations, and it agrees with the root node (R1) regarding the right to refuse performance under specified conditions.

**Output:**
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 85
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article seeks to establish that if one of the joint and several obligors performs the obligation or obtains a common discharge without giving notice to the other obligors and another joint and several obligor duly asserts a defense against the obligee, the latter may assert that defense against the former to the extent of their share. Specifically, it concludes that in such cases, if a set-off is asserted as a defense, the joint and several obligor who obtained the discharge may request the obligee to perform the obligation that should have been extinguished due to set-off.

- **R1**: A joint and several obligor who obtains a common discharge without notice may be subject to a defense from another joint and several obligor who asserts a set-off, potentially leading to a request for the obligee to perform an obligation that was supposed to be extinguished.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
- **A1**: Knowledge of other joint and several obligors by the obligor obtaining the discharge.
- **A2**: Assertion of a defense by another joint and several obligor against the obligee.
- **A3**: The existence of a set-off as part of the defense.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
- Under **A1**, we can refine it to:
  - **B1**: The obligor obtaining the discharge knew about other joint and several obligors but did not give notice.
- Under **A2**, refinement yields:
  - **B2**: The defense asserted by another joint and several obligor is valid and duly made against the obligee.
- Under **A3**, we refine to:
  - **B3**: The set-off is a legitimate defense that affects the obligations between the parties.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Knowledge without notice supports the abstract condition of joint and several obligors' awareness.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): A valid defense assertion supports the abstract factor of another obligor asserting a defense.
- (**B3** supports **A3**): A legitimate set-off supports the abstract condition regarding the type of defense.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Awareness without notice is crucial for the root conclusion.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): The assertion of a defense directly impacts the outcome described in the root node.
- (**A3** supports **R1**): The existence of a set-off as a defense affects the obligations and thus supports the root conclusion.

### Analysis of Query:
Given the query, "In the case that D owes C a debt (Y) of 200000 yen that is set off against the debt (X), if A, knowing that C is a joint and several obligor of the debt (X), pays 600000 yen to D and claims reimbursement from C without giving notice to C and C duly asserts a set-off as defense against A, A may request D to pay 200000 yen of Y which should have been extinguished due to set-off."

- The query entails **B1** because it involves a situation where A knows about another joint and several obligor (C) but does not give notice before claiming reimbursement.
- The query entails **B2** as C duly asserts a defense against A, implying a valid assertion of a defense.
- The query entails **B3** since the set-off is considered a legitimate part of the defense mechanism between the parties.

### Justification:
The query and root node **R1** agree on the legal conclusion that in such scenarios, where one joint and several obligor obtains a discharge without notice and another asserts a valid defense (including set-off), the former may request the obligee to perform an obligation supposed to be extinguished due to set-off. Thus, (**query agrees R1**).

Upon re-justification, considering all aspects of the query in relation to the constructed structure, it's evident that the query directly aligns with the conditions and conclusions outlined in **R1**, supporting the initial agreement.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this framework, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a manifestation of intention to restrict assignment made by a party regarding a claim for deposits can be asserted against a third party (such as an assignee) if that third party knew or did not know due to gross negligence about the restriction. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The effectiveness of restricting assignment of a deposit claim against a third party depends on the third party's knowledge or gross negligence regarding the restriction.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion in R1 are:
- **A1**: The existence of a special agreement between parties restricting assignment.
- **A2**: The assignee's knowledge or lack thereof due to gross negligence about the restriction.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2, since it encompasses scenarios of both knowledge and gross negligence:
- **B1**: The assignee had actual knowledge of the restriction.
- **B2**: The assignee did not know about the restriction due to gross negligence.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The existence of a special agreement restricting assignment directly supports the effectiveness of such restriction against third parties.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The assignee's knowledge or lack thereof due to gross negligence about the restriction also supports the assertion of the restriction against them.
- **(B1 supports A2)**: Actual knowledge by the assignee is a scenario where the assignee knew, supporting A2.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Gross negligence regarding the restriction is another scenario supporting A2.

### Assessing the Query
Given query: "If a deposit claim held by A against Bank (B) is subject to a special agreement that it cannot be assigned, even if A enters into an agreement with G to assign the deposit claim, the assignment will not be effective if G was in bad faith or grossly negligent with respect to the special agreement."

- **(query entails B2)**: The query specifically mentions "grossly negligent," which aligns with the scenario described by B2.
  
### Agreement with Root Node
The query essentially states that if there's a restriction on assignment and the assignee (G) was grossly negligent about this, then the assignment is not effective. This directly agrees with R1, as it stipulates conditions under which the restriction can be effectively asserted against a third party.

- **(query agree R1)**: The query aligns with the root node's conclusion regarding the effectiveness of restricting assignment based on the assignee's knowledge or negligence.

### Rejustification
Upon reconsideration, the analysis holds because:
- The root node (R1) correctly identifies the core issue of asserting restrictions against third parties.
- Abstract factors A1 and A2 are properly derived as they cover the essential aspects influencing R1.
- Base-level factor B2 is accurately refined from A2, directly relating to the query's mention of "grossly negligent."
- The directed links logically connect these elements, forming a coherent structure that supports the conclusion in R1.

Thus, the final assessment confirms the initial conclusions:
- **(query entails B2)**
- **(query agree R1)**

correct prediction case 87
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 499 is that a person who has performed the obligation for the benefit of the obligor is subrogated to the claim of the obligee. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** A third-party collateral provider who pays a secured claim is subrogated to the claim of the obligee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1:** The performance of the obligation by the third party for the benefit of the obligor.
- **A2:** The applicability of subrogation principles as per Article 499.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into base-level factors:
- **B1:** The third-party collateral provider has a legitimate interest in making the performance.
- **B2:** The subrogation does not require additional perfection when the third party pays the secured claim.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1):** Because having a legitimate interest is crucial for the performance to be considered valid under Article 499.
- **(B2 supports A2):** Since subrogation without requiring perfection directly relates to how the claim can be exercised after payment by the third party.
- **(A1 supports R1):** The performance of the obligation is a direct condition for subrogation.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The principle that subrogation applies in such scenarios directly supports the root conclusion.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "If a third-party collateral provider paid a secured claim, the third-party collateral provider may exercise the secured claim acquired through subrogation without requirement for perfection."

- **(query entails B2):** Because both are considering a scenario where a third party pays a secured claim and the issue of requiring perfection for exercising the claim is addressed.
  
### Agreement with Root Node
- **(query agree R1):** The query and the root node R1 present similar verdicts in comparable situations. Both affirm that a third-party collateral provider can be subrogated to the claim of the obligee after paying a secured claim, with the query specifying this can happen without requiring perfection.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation, it's clear that the query directly pertains to the conditions under which a third-party collateral provider can exercise a secured claim through subrogation, aligning with the base-level factor B2 and supporting the root conclusion R1. The focus on "without requirement for perfection" is a specific condition that supports the broader principle of subrogation as outlined in Article 499.

Therefore, the final output based on the analysis is:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 88
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 502(1), the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A subrogee may exercise the rights of the subrogee together with the obligee in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance when performance by subrogation occurs with respect to one part of a claim, provided the obligee consents.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion. For R1, we can derive:
- **A1**: The occurrence of partial performance by subrogation with respect to a claim.
- **A2**: The consent of the obligee for joint exercise of rights.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific base-level factors:
- Under **A1**, we can have:
  - **B1**: The subrogee has partially paid a secured claim.
  - **B2**: There is a remaining obligation after the partial payment.
- Under **A2**, we might not need further refinement for this example, but it could include specific conditions under which consent is given.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links show how each factor supports or denies the occurrence of the root legal determination or another abstract factor:
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Partial payment of a secured claim supports the condition of partial performance by subrogation.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): The existence of a remaining obligation after partial payment also supports the scenario of partial performance.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): The occurrence of partial performance by subrogation supports the root node's conclusion about exercising rights proportionally.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): The obligee's consent is necessary for the joint exercise of rights, thus supporting the root node.

### Evaluating the Query
Given the query: "If a guarantor has partially paid a secured claim but there is a remaining obligation, the guarantor may independently exercise the secured claim and the security right acquired through subrogation in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance."

- **Justification for Entailment**: The query mentions partial payment of a secured claim and a remaining obligation, which directly relates to **B1** and **B2**. Thus, (query entails **B1**) and (query entails **B2**).
- **Agreement with the Root Node**: The query suggests that after partial payment, the guarantor may exercise rights independently in proportion to their performance. This seems to align with the principle behind **R1**, which allows for proportional exercise of rights after partial performance by subrogation, albeit **R1** specifies joint exercise with the obligee's consent. However, the query implies independent action, which might not fully align with the need for consent in **R1** but does reflect a scenario where rights are exercised proportionally to the value of performance. Thus, there seems to be an alignment in the proportional exercise aspect but a potential discrepancy regarding independent action versus joint action with consent.

### Re-Justification
Upon reevaluation, considering the emphasis on "independently" in the query, which contrasts with the joint exercise specified in **R1**, it's crucial to acknowledge this distinction. The core principle of exercising rights proportionally to the performance value is shared, but the mode of exercise (independent vs. joint with consent) differs. Therefore, while the query aligns with the base-level factors (**B1** and **B2**), its agreement with **R1** might be more nuanced due to the independent action aspect.

Given this analysis:
- (query entails **B1**)
- (query entails **B2**)
- The query's alignment with **R1** is nuanced, focusing on proportional exercise of rights but differing in the independence of action, which could suggest a disagreement on the specifics of how these rights are exercised rather than the principle of proportionality itself. Thus, it might be more accurate to say (query partially disagrees **R1**) due to the independent action aspect not being explicitly supported by **R1** as described.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The article seeks to establish that if there is a person with a legitimate interest in performing an obligation and the obligee causes the security thereof to be lost or diminished intentionally or negligently, this person is relieved from responsibility to the extent they can no longer seek reimbursement due to the loss or diminution in security available upon subrogation.
   - **Root Node (R1):** "A person entitled to subrogation is relieved from responsibility if the obligee causes the security to be lost or diminished intentionally or negligently."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - **Abstract Factor (A1):** The obligee's actions were intentional or negligent in causing the loss or diminution of security.
   - **Abstract Factor (A2):** The person entitled to subrogation has a legitimate interest in performing the obligation.
   - **Abstract Factor (A3):** The obligee had reasonable grounds for causing the security to be lost or diminished.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - **Base-Level Factor (B1) for A1:** The obligee's actions were intentional in causing the loss or diminution of security.
   - **Base-Level Factor (B2) for A1:** The obligee's actions were negligent in causing the loss or diminution of security.
   - **Base-Level Factor (B3) for A3:** The reasonable grounds were based on common sense in the transaction.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **(A1 supports R1):** The intention or negligence of the obligee supports the relief of responsibility from the person entitled to subrogation.
   - **(A2 supports R1):** Having a legitimate interest in performing the obligation supports the condition for relief from responsibility.
   - **(A3 denies R1):** Having reasonable grounds for causing the loss or diminution denies the relief from responsibility.

Given the query: "In case that the obligee is found to have reasonable grounds in light of the common sense in the transaction for causing the security to be diminished, the guarantor may not assert that the guarantor is relieved from responsibility to the extent that the guarantor can no longer seek the reimbursement due to the diminution in the security available upon subrogation."

- **Justification:** The query entails a scenario where the obligee's actions were justified by reasonable grounds based on common sense, which directly relates to **Base-Level Factor (B3)** and by extension **Abstract Factor (A3).** Thus, **(query entails B3).**
  
- **Agreement with Root Node:** Given that the query discusses a situation where the obligee had reasonable grounds for diminishing the security, it implies that the person entitled to subrogation cannot be relieved from responsibility. This aligns with the denial of relief when there are reasonable grounds (as per A3 denies R1). Therefore, in this scenario, **(query agree R1)** because both state that if there are reasonable grounds for the obligee's actions, the guarantor (person entitled to subrogation) cannot claim relief from responsibility.

Upon careful reconsideration, it's clear that the initial analysis correctly identified the relationship between the query and the base-level factor B3, as well as its agreement with the root node R1 under the specific condition provided. The structure and relationships established align with the legal principles outlined in the article, emphasizing the importance of the obligee's intent and justification in determining the relief from responsibility for the person entitled to subrogation.

wrong prediction case 90
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that unless the parties manifest a particular intention with respect to a claim which bears interest, the rate of the interest is the statutory interest rate as of the time when the interest first accrues. Thus, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The rate of interest on a claim is the statutory interest rate at the time interest first accrues unless otherwise specified by the parties.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The absence of a particular intention manifested by the parties regarding the interest rate.
- **A2**: The applicability of statutory interest rates to claims.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2** into base-level factors:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The parties have not explicitly agreed on an interest rate for the claim.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: The statutory framework provides for a default interest rate applicable to all claims unless otherwise specified.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links can be established as follows:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: If the parties haven't agreed on an interest rate, it supports the condition that there's no particular intention regarding the interest rate.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The existence of a statutory default rate supports the applicability of statutory interest rates to claims.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The absence of a specified interest rate intention by the parties supports the conclusion that the statutory rate applies.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The general applicability of statutory interest rates to claims supports the conclusion about the default rate.

Given this structure, let's address the query:
"Unless the parties manifest a particular intention with respect to a claim which bears interest, the rate of the interest is the statutory interest rate as of the time when the interest first accrues."

### Justification
- The query directly aligns with **R1**, suggesting that if there's no specific agreement on interest rates by the parties, the statutory interest rate applies.
- Since the query talks about the absence of a particular intention and the applicability of statutory rates, it can be said to entail base-level factors similar to **B1** (absence of an agreed-upon interest rate) because both are considering scenarios where no specific interest rate is agreed upon by the parties.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)**.

Considering the agreement with the root node:
- The query and **R1** present the same verdict in a comparable situation—both state that unless otherwise specified, the statutory interest rate applies at the time interest first accrues. Thus, there's an agreement between the query and the root node regarding the application of statutory interest rates when no specific intention is manifested by the parties.
- Hence, **(query agree R1)**.

After careful reconsideration, these justifications hold because both the structure derived from the article and the query itself hinge on the principle that statutory interest rates apply as a default in the absence of any specified agreement between parties regarding claims that bear interest.

correct prediction case 91
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish where the delivery of a specific thing or the discharge of any other obligation must be effected when no particular intention is manifested with respect to the place of performance. Thus, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: The delivery of a specific thing must be effected at the place where that thing was located when the relevant claim accrued, and the discharge of any other obligation must be effected at the current domicile of the obligee.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors substantiating or undermining this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The manifestation of a particular intention with respect to the place where performance should take place.
- **A2**: The location of the specific thing when the relevant claim accrued for obligations involving specific things.
- **A3**: The current domicile of the obligee for obligations not involving specific things.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1**:
  - **B1**: If a particular intention is manifested regarding the performance place, it dictates where performance should occur.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B2**: For specific things, delivery occurs at their location when the claim accrued if no other intention is shown.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B3**: For non-specific obligations, discharge happens at the obligee's current domicile unless otherwise intended.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links include:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Showing that a manifested intention about performance location directly affects where performance occurs.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Indicating that for specific things, their original location is key unless otherwise stated.
- **(B3 supports A3)**: Stating that the obligee's domicile is crucial for non-specific obligations without other intentions.

Given these steps and considering the query:
"Unless a particular intention is manifested with respect to the place where the performance should take place, even if X was located at the domicile of D at the time of the conclusion of contract for sale, the delivery of X must be effected at the current domicile of B."

### Justification
- The query entails **B2** because it considers a scenario involving a specific thing (X) and discusses where its delivery should occur based on the absence of a particular intention regarding performance location.
  
  - **(query entails B2)**

- Comparing this to the root node **R1**, the query actually seems to disagree with **R1** in the comparable situation because it suggests delivering X at B's current domicile, even if X was initially located elsewhere (at D's domicile), which contradicts the principle that specific things should be delivered where they were when the claim accrued unless a particular intention is shown.

  - **(query disagree R1)**

After reconsideration, this analysis remains consistent with the ANGELIC structure formation criteria and accurately reflects the relationships between the query, base-level factors, and the root node based on the provided legal provisions. 

Output:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

correct prediction case 92
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 539-2 is that if one party to a contract makes an agreement with a third party to transfer their contractual status and the other party consents, then the contractual status is transferred.
   - **Root Node (R1):** "Contractual status is transferred to a third party upon consent from the other contracting party."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Key factors include an agreement between one of the original parties and a third party for the transfer, and consent from the other original party.
   - **Abstract Factor (A1):** "Existence of an agreement between one of the original parties and a third party."
   - **Abstract Factor (A2):** "Consent from the other original party to the contract."

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, we could refine it further but based on the information provided, let's consider a base-level factor related to consent since that is more directly comparable with the query.
   - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** "The other party to the contract gives consent for the transfer of contractual status."
   
4. **Establish Directed Links:**
   - **(A1 supports R1):** The existence of an agreement between one original party and a third party supports the transfer of contractual status.
   - **(A2 supports R1):** Consent from the other original party directly supports the transfer of contractual status.
   - **(B1 supports A2):** Since B1 is about consent, which directly relates to A2, it supports A2.

Given the query: "If B makes an agreement with E to transfer contractual status of the buyer to E, regardless of whether A consents, the status of the buyer is transferred to E."

- **(query entails B1):** The query considers a scenario where consent (or lack thereof) from one party (A) is a factor, similar to what B1 addresses regarding the necessity of consent for the transfer.
  
- To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with R1:
  - R1 stipulates that consent from the other contracting party is necessary for the transfer of contractual status.
  - The query suggests that the transfer occurs "regardless of whether A consents," which directly contradicts the condition set forth in R1.
  
Therefore, **(query disagree R1).**

After re-justification, considering the emphasis on consent in both the original article and the structure, the conclusion holds. The query's disregard for the necessity of consent (suggesting transfer occurs regardless of A's consent) fundamentally disagrees with the root node's stipulation that consent is a required condition for the transfer of contractual status.

correct prediction case 93
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if one of the parties promises in a contract to render a certain performance to a third party, the third party has the right to claim that performance directly from the obligor, and this does not depend on the existence or specification of the third party at the time of contract formation. Thus, the Root Node (R1) is: "A contract promising performance to a third party is valid even if the third party does not exist or is not specified at the time of its formation."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The principle that a contract can stipulate benefits for a third party.
- **A2**: The validity of a contract does not depend on the immediate existence or specification of the third-party beneficiary.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For A1 and A2, we can refine them as follows:
- For A1, a base-level factor could be **B1**: The contract explicitly names the third party to receive the benefit.
- For A2, a base-level factor could be **B2**: The contract's validity is not affected by the third party's non-existence or lack of specification at the time of formation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **B1 supports A1** because explicitly naming the third-party beneficiary aligns with the principle that a contract can stipulate benefits for a third party.
- **B2 supports A2** since it directly addresses the scenario where the contract remains valid despite the third party's status at the time of contract formation.
- **A1 supports R1** as it underpins the concept that contracts can indeed benefit third parties, contributing to the overall validity of such contractual agreements.
- **A2 supports R1** because it directly addresses and resolves concerns about the contract's validity in relation to the third party's existence or specification.

Given the query: "If the contract of sale stipulates that F, who was not born at the time of the conclusion of the contract, is to acquire the ownership of X, the contract of sale is invalid."

### Justification
- The query entails **B2** because it considers a scenario where the third party (F) does not exist at the time of the contract's formation, similar to what B2 addresses.
- However, the query disagrees with **R1**. R1 suggests that such contracts are valid even if the third party does not exist or is not specified at the time of formation, whereas the query concludes that the contract of sale is invalid under these circumstances.

Therefore:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

After rejustification, considering the principles outlined in Article 537 and the specifics of the query, it's clear that while the scenario presented by the query aligns with the conditions addressed by B2, its conclusion about the contract's validity directly contradicts the principle established by R1. Thus, the initial analysis stands correct upon reevaluation.

correct prediction case 94
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 537 and 538 can be summarized into a single root node for our purpose:
- **R1**: A contract between two parties (e.g., A and B) where one party promises to render a performance directly to a third party (G), and after G's rights have accrued, the contract cannot be modified or cancelled without G's consent regarding those rights.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

- **A1**: The existence of a contractual stipulation that specifies a third party is to acquire ownership or benefit from a performance.
- **A2**: The manifestation of intention by the third party to avail themselves of the benefit stipulated in the contract.
- **A3**: Non-performance by the obligor (e.g., A delaying delivery) after the third party's rights have accrued.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining **A1**:
- **B1**: The contract explicitly stipulates that a third party is to acquire ownership of an item (X).
- **B2**: The contractual performance is directly related to the benefit of the third party.

Refining **A2**:
- **B3**: The third party has expressed their intention to receive the benefit, thereby confirming their role in the contract.
  
Refining **A3**:
- **B4**: The obligor fails to deliver the item (X) as promised after the third party's rights have been established.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- (**B1 supports A1**)
- (**B2 supports A1**)
- (**B3 supports A2**)
- (**B4 supports A3**)
- (**A1 supports R1**), because the stipulation is a prerequisite for third-party rights.
- (**A2 supports R1**), since the third party's intention to receive the benefit solidifies their claim.
- (**A3 denies R1**), in the context that non-performance might lead to contract cancellation, but only without G's consent.

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root

Given the query: "If A delays in delivering X after the contract of sale stipulates that a third party (G) is to acquire the ownership of X and G manifests intention of availing of the benefit, B may not cancel the contract of sale without G's consent."

- **(Query entails B1)** because both involve a contractual stipulation about a third party acquiring ownership.
- **(Query entails B3)** as it mentions G manifesting the intention to avail themselves of the benefit.
- **(Query entails B4)** since A's delay in delivery is akin to non-performance after rights have accrued.

The query essentially aligns with the protection afforded to the third party (G) under Articles 537 and 538, particularly emphasizing that once G's rights are established, B cannot unilaterally cancel the contract without G's consent due to A's non-performance. Thus:
- **(Query agrees R1)** because both conclude that after a third party's rights have accrued from a contractual stipulation for their benefit, modifications or cancellations of those rights require the third party's consent.

Upon reevaluation, this justification holds as it correctly interprets the legal provisions in relation to the scenario described in the query. The focus on protecting third-party rights after they have accrued and the conditions under which contracts involving such stipulations can be modified or cancelled aligns with the principles outlined in Articles 537 and 538.

wrong prediction case 95
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 415 and Article 561 combined in the context of the query can be summarized as follows:
- **Root Node (R1):** A buyer can claim damages if a seller fails to transfer rights due to the seller not having those rights, even if the buyer was aware at the time of the contract that the rights belonged to another party.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The seller's obligation to acquire and transfer the right.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The buyer's knowledge at the time of the contract about the ownership of the rights.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The grounds for failure to perform the obligation being attributable or not attributable to the obligor.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these factors further:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1:** The seller's inability to acquire the rights due to them belonging to another party.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) under A2:** The buyer's awareness of the rights' ownership at the time of contract formation does not negate their right to claim damages.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links include:
- **(A1 supports R1):** The seller's obligation to acquire and transfer the right supports the conclusion that a buyer can claim damages if this obligation is not met.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The buyer's knowledge about the ownership of the rights at the time of the contract supports the specific scenario under which damages can be claimed.
- **(B1 supports A1):** The seller's inability to acquire the rights due to them belonging to another party supports the abstract factor of the seller's obligation.
- **(B2 supports A2):** The buyer's awareness not negating their right to claim damages supports the abstract factor concerning the buyer's knowledge.

### Justification
Given the query: "In the case that the seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights to the buyer, if the buyer, at the moment of the contract, knows that the rights the buyer has bought do not belong to the seller, it shall not preclude a buyer from making a claim for damages."
- **(query entails B2):** The query specifically mentions the scenario where the buyer is aware of the ownership issue at the time of the contract, aligning with Base-Level Factor B2.
- **(query agree R1):** The query concludes that the buyer can still make a claim for damages under these conditions, which agrees with the Root Node R1's verdict.

Upon careful reconsideration, this analysis holds as it directly addresses the conditions and outcomes described in both the legal provisions and the query. Therefore, the conclusion that the query entails Base-Level Factor B2 and agrees with Root Node R1 remains justified.

correct prediction case 96
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 415 and its implications in conjunction with Article 561 can be summarized as follows:
- **Root Node (R1):** A buyer may claim compensation for loss or damage from a seller if the seller fails to perform their obligations, including acquiring and transferring rights, under specific conditions.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The failure to perform is due to grounds attributable to the obligor (seller).
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The subject matter of the sale involves rights that belong to another person, and the seller has an obligation to acquire and transfer these rights.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2 into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The seller's inability to acquire and transfer the rights is due to their own fault or negligence.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The sale involves a right that belongs entirely to another person, necessitating acquisition by the seller before transfer.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: If the seller's failure is due to their fault, it supports the condition that the failure is attributable to them.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The involvement of a right belonging entirely to another person supports the necessity for the seller to acquire and transfer this right.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: If the failure is due to grounds attributable to the seller, it supports the buyer's claim for compensation.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The obligation to acquire and transfer rights belonging to another person supports the condition under which a buyer may claim compensation if this obligation is not met.

### Justification
Given the query "In the case that the seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights to the buyer, the buyer may claim to seller compensation for loss or damage even if the case is not caused by grounds attributable to the seller," we can analyze as follows:
- **(query entails B2)**: The scenario described involves a right belonging to another person, which aligns with B2.
- However, upon closer examination, the query seems to disagree with the principle established in R1 when it suggests that compensation may be claimed even if the failure is not due to grounds attributable to the seller. This directly contradicts the conditions under which compensation can be sought according to Article 415.

Therefore, considering the structure and the implications of the articles:
- **(query disagrees R1)**: The query's premise about claiming compensation regardless of attributability to the seller contradicts the root node's condition that compensation claims are valid when the failure is due to grounds attributable to the obligor (seller).

Upon rejustification, considering the nuances of legal interpretations and the specifics of the articles provided:
- The initial analysis stands. The query indeed suggests a scenario where the buyer seeks compensation under conditions (not being due to the seller's fault) that contradict the principle outlined in Article 415 and its application through Article 561.

Hence, **(query entails B2)** and **(query disagrees R1)**.

correct prediction case 97
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 562 and Article 563 combined seeks to establish that a buyer may demand cure for non-conformity of performance by the seller, and if the non-conformity is not cured within a specified period or under certain conditions, the buyer may request a reduction of the price. Thus, the root node can be determined as:

- **R1**: A buyer may request a reduction of the purchase price if the seller fails to cure non-conformity of performance.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The subject matter delivered does not conform to the contract terms regarding kind, quality, or quantity.
- **A2**: The seller's ability or inability to cure the non-conformity within a reasonable period.
- **A3**: Specific circumstances under which a buyer can immediately request a price reduction without demanding cure (e.g., impossibility to cure, seller's refusal, time-sensitive contracts).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining **A2** and **A3**:
- Under **A2**, we have:
  - **B1**: The non-conformity is impossible to cure.
  - **B2**: The seller unequivocally refuses to cure the non-conformity.
- Under **A3**, specifically for time-sensitive contracts, we could consider:
  - **B3**: The contract's purpose cannot be achieved unless performance is carried out at a specific time or within a certain period.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- **(B1 supports A2)**: If the non-conformity is impossible to cure, it directly supports the condition under which the seller's ability to cure affects the buyer's right to request a price reduction.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: The seller's refusal to cure also impacts their ability to fulfill the contractual obligations, supporting the factor related to the seller's performance.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Non-conformity of the subject matter with contract terms is a fundamental reason for requesting a price reduction.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The seller's inability or refusal to cure non-conformity directly supports the buyer's right to request a reduction in price.
- **(A3 supports R1)**: Specific circumstances allowing immediate price reduction requests without demanding cure support the root conclusion.

Given the query, "If the seller cannot transfer any part of the rights which are the subject matter of the sale because the part of the rights belong to others and it is impossible to cure the non-conformity of performance, the seller may immediately claim a reduction of the purchase money without demand."

- **(Query entails B1)**: The query considers a scenario where the non-conformity is impossible to cure due to the nature of the subject matter (rights belonging to others), aligning with base-level factor B1.

Regarding agreement or disagreement with the root node:
- **(Query agree R1)**: Both the query and the root node conclude that under certain conditions (impossibility to cure non-conformity being one of them), a party (in the query, it's inaccurately stated as the seller, but based on the context, it should refer to the buyer) may request a reduction in price without demanding cure, which aligns with the principle established by R1.

After careful reconsideration:
- The initial assessment stands correct. The query indeed entails **B1** because both involve scenarios where curing non-conformity is impossible.
- The agreement with **R1** also holds because the core principle of requesting a price reduction due to non-curable non-conformity aligns between the query and R1, despite the query's misattribution of the party benefiting from this provision.

Therefore:
- (Query entails B1)
- (Query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should represent a clear legal conclusion or verdict derived from the articles. Based on Article 564 and Article 565, we can deduce that the buyer has certain rights if the seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights as agreed upon in the contract. A possible root node could be:
- R1: The buyer may claim compensation for loss or damage or cancel the contract if the seller fails to transfer the rights as per the contract.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that support or deny the root legal determination. From Articles 564 and 565, we can identify:
- A1: The seller's failure to acquire and transfer the rights as agreed upon.
- A2: The buyer's knowledge at the time of the contract about the seller's inability to transfer the rights.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors helps in applying these principles to specific conditions. For A1 and A2:
- B1 (under A1): The seller's failure to acquire the rights due to them not belonging to the seller.
- B2 (under A2): The buyer's awareness at the contract signing that the rights were not the seller's to transfer.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Now, we establish how these factors relate to each other:
- B1 supports A1 (The specific scenario of the seller not having the rights supports the abstract factor of the seller's failure to acquire and transfer rights).
- B2 supports A2 (The buyer's awareness at the time of signing supports the abstract factor of the buyer knowing about the issue).
- A1 supports R1 (The seller's failure to fulfill their part of the contract supports the buyer's right to claim compensation or cancel).
- A2 denies R1 (If the buyer knew about the issue from the start, it could deny their ability to later claim ignorance and thus affect their right to compensation or cancellation).

### Evaluating the Query
The query states: "In the case that the seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights to the buyer, if the buyer, at the moment of the contract, knows that the rights the buyer has bought do not belong to the seller, the seller may not cancel the contract." This scenario directly relates to B2 (the buyer's knowledge) and A1 (seller's inability to transfer rights), but specifically addresses a situation where the buyer's prior knowledge could influence their legal options.

### Justification
- The query entails B2 because it discusses a scenario where the buyer is aware from the start that the seller cannot transfer the rights.
- Considering R1, which focuses on the buyer's right to claim compensation or cancel the contract due to the seller's failure to fulfill their obligations, the query seems to disagree with R1. This disagreement arises because the query suggests that if the buyer knew about the issue from the beginning (entailing B2), it might limit their ability to later take action against the seller for not fulfilling the contract, potentially denying them the right to cancel as outlined in R1.

Therefore, based on the constructed ANGELIC structure and the given query:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

correct prediction case 99
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if the subject matter delivered by the seller does not conform to the terms of the contract and the buyer fails to notify the seller within one year from the time when the buyer becomes aware of it, the buyer may not make certain claims against the seller.

- **Root Node (R1):** The buyer may not demand cure of the non-conformity of performance, demand a reduction of the price, claim compensation for loss or damage, or cancel the contract due to non-conformity if notice is not given within one year.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors here include:
- The delivery of non-conforming goods.
- The buyer's failure to notify the seller within a specified time frame.
- The seller's knowledge or gross negligence regarding the non-conformity.

Let's denote these as:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Non-conformity of delivered goods.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Buyer's notification within the specified time frame.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Seller's knowledge or gross negligence.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1, we might consider:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The delivered goods do not match the contract in terms of kind.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The delivered goods do not match the contract in terms of quality.

For A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The buyer is aware of the non-conformity but fails to notify within one year.
- **Base-Level Factor (B4):** The seller's knowledge or gross negligence about the non-conformity at the time of delivery affects the applicability of the one-year notification rule.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **(A1 supports R1):** Non-conformity of goods is a basis for the buyer's potential claims.
- **(A2 denies R1):** Failure to notify within the specified time frame limits the buyer's ability to make claims, thus denying R1 under normal circumstances.
- **(A3 denies R1):** If the seller knew or should have known about the non-conformity due to gross negligence, it affects the application of the rule stated in R1.
- **(B1 supports A1), (B2 supports A1):** Both scenarios of non-conformity support the abstract factor of non-conforming goods.
- **(B3 supports A2), (B4 denies A2):** B3 supports the notion that failure to notify is a critical factor, while B4 introduces an exception based on the seller's knowledge or negligence.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "In the case that the seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights to the buyer, the buyer may not make a claim for damages to the seller in good faith without giving a notice within a year from the time when the seller knows the fact that the rights belong to others."

- **(Query entails B3):** The scenario described involves a failure to notify (in this case, about rights belonging to others), which aligns with B3's context of failing to notify within a specified timeframe.

### Agreement/Disagreement with Root Node
The query essentially discusses a situation where the buyer cannot make certain claims due to a lack of notification within a specific time frame. This scenario is comparable to R1, as both involve limitations on the buyer's ability to make claims due to notification issues.

- **(Query agree R1):** The query and R1 agree that failure to provide timely notice can limit the buyer's legal recourse against the seller.

Upon rejustification, considering the specific details of the query and how it aligns with the factors and root node established from the article, the conclusion holds. The query indeed entails a base-level factor related to notification and agrees with the root node regarding the limitations imposed by failure to notify within a specified timeframe.

correct prediction case 100
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow the step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 605-2 seeks to establish the transfer of the lessor's status and obligations in cases where leased immovables are assigned. Thus, the root node can be determined as:
- R1: The assignee succeeds to the obligation of the assignor to reimburse expenses to the lessee when the status of the lessor is transferred.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: Perfection of the lease in accordance with laws and regulations.
- A2: Agreement between the assignor and assignee regarding the reservation of the lessor's status.
- A3: Registration of the transfer of ownership for the immovables under lease.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors, we have:
- B1 (supports A1): The lease is perfected in accordance with Article 605-2 and other relevant laws.
- B2 (supports A2): There is an agreement between the assignor and assignee that the assignor reserves the status of lessor.
- B3 (supports A3): The transfer of ownership for the immovables under lease is registered.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- B1 supports A1.
- B2 supports A2.
- B3 supports A3.
- A1 supports R1.
- A2 can either support or deny R1, depending on the specifics of the agreement (e.g., if the assignor reserves the status of lessor, it might deny R1).
- A3 supports R1.

Given the query: "If a leased immovables are assigned and the status of the lessor is transferred to the assignee, the assignee thereof succeeds to the obligation of assignor to reimburse expenses to the lessee."

### Justification
The query entails B1 because it considers the scenario where the lease's perfection leads to the transfer of the lessor's status, which aligns with B1.
- (query entails B1).

Regarding agreement with the root node R1:
- The query and R1 agree on the outcome when the status of the lessor is transferred; the assignee succeeds to the obligation to reimburse expenses. Thus,
- (query agrees R1).

After careful reconsideration, the justification remains consistent with the initial analysis based on the provided legal provisions and the structure constructed according to the ANGELIC criteria.

Therefore, the final answer is:
(query entails B1), (query agrees R1).

wrong prediction case 101
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The root node (R1) is: "A lessor assumes an obligation to effect repairs necessary for using and making profit of the leased thing."

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Two abstract factors are identified:
- A1: The necessity of repairs for using and making a profit from the leased thing.
- A2: Repairs being necessary due to grounds attributable to the lessee.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
For A2, we can refine it into a base-level factor:
- B1: The lessor's obligation does not apply when repairs are necessary due to grounds attributable to the lessee.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- A1 supports R1.
- A2 denies R1.
- B1 supports A2.

Given the query: "A lessor assumes an obligation to effect repairs necessary for using and making profit of the leased thing even if repairs are necessary due to any grounds attributable to the lessee."

### Analysis:
The query directly contradicts the base-level factor B1, which states that the lessor's obligation does not apply when repairs are due to the lessee's actions. Since the query considers a scenario where the lessor is still obligated despite the repairs being necessary due to the lessee, it essentially denies the condition set by B1.

However, the correct interpretation based on the provided instructions for justification:
- The query entails B1 because both consider scenarios involving the necessity of repairs due to grounds attributable to the lessee.
  
Regarding the agreement or disagreement with the root node (R1):
- The query disagree R1 because R1 states that the lessor assumes an obligation for repairs necessary for using and making a profit from the leased thing, with an exception for repairs due to the lessee's actions. The query suggests that the lessor is obligated even in cases where repairs are needed due to the lessee, which contradicts the original statement of R1.

Justification:
Upon careful consideration, it becomes clear that the initial interpretation may have misaligned with the instructions provided for determining entailment and agreement/disagreement with the root node. The query indeed presents a scenario that directly pertains to the conditions outlined in B1 but does so in a manner that contradicts the lessor's obligation as stated in R1 when considering the lessee's responsibility.

Therefore, the corrected output based on the instructions is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

correct prediction case 102
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 611 is that if it becomes impossible to use or profit from part of a leased thing due to grounds such as loss and this is caused by grounds not attributable to the lessee, the rent is reduced in proportion to the value of the part that can no longer be used or profited from. Therefore, the Root Node (R1) can be determined as:
- R1: The rent is reduced for the unusable part of a leased property when the cause is not attributable to the lessee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: The impossibility to use or profit from part of the leased thing.
- A2: The cause of the impossibility is not attributable to the lessee.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors, we can identify base-level factors as:
- B1 (under A1): The leased property has suffered a loss.
- B2 (under A1): The loss affects the usability or profitability of part of the leased thing.
- B3 (under A2): The cause of the loss is due to natural disasters, third-party actions, or other factors beyond the lessee's control.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are established as follows:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A1
- B3 supports A2

Given that each base-level factor directly relates to its respective abstract factor, and these in turn support the root node's conclusion without direct links from base-level factors to the root or other abstract factors, we adhere to the ANGELIC structure formation criteria.

### Justification of Query Entailment
The query mentions "it comes to no longer be possible to use or profit from part of a leased thing due to grounds such as loss and this is caused by grounds not attributable to the lessee," which directly aligns with base-level factors B1, B2, and especially B3. Thus, we can say:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query entails B3)

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node
Since the query outlines a scenario where the conditions for rent reduction are met (impossibility to use due to non-attributable causes), it aligns with the conclusion of R1. Therefore:
- (query agree R1)

Upon re-justification, considering the provided legal provision and the structured approach to analyzing its components, the conclusion remains consistent: the query entails base-level factors that support the conditions under which rent reduction is applicable according to Article 611, and it agrees with the root node's verdict on reducing rent in such scenarios.

wrong prediction case 103
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 613(3) is that if the lessee lawfully subleases a leased thing, the lessor may not duly assert against the sublessee the cancellation by agreement of the lease with the lessee.
   - Root Node (R1): "Lessor cannot cancel lease agreement with sublessee due to lawful subleasing."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion are:
     - A1: Lawful subleasing by the lessee.
     - A2: Cancellation of the lease agreement by the lessor.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - Refining A1 and A2 into more specific base-level factors:
     - B1: The lessee has lawfully subleased the property.
     - B2: The cancellation is based on an agreement between the lessor and the lessee.
     - B3: The lessor had a right to cancel due to non-performance by the lessee at the time of cancellation.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - (B1 supports A1) because lawful subleasing directly relates to the condition that allows the sublessee protection.
   - (B2 supports A2) as it specifies a reason for cancellation.
   - (B3 denies R1) because if the lessor had a right to cancel due to non-performance, this exception allows them to assert cancellation against the sublessee.

Now, considering the query: "If the lessee lawfully subleases a leased thing, the lessor may not duly assert against the sublessee the cancellation by agreement of the lease with the lessee even if the lessor has a right to cancel due to non-performance on the part of the lessee at the time of the cancellation."

- **Justification whether the query entails base-level factors:**
  - The query directly mentions lawful subleasing and the condition of the lessor having a right to cancel due to non-performance, which aligns with B1 and B3.
  - Therefore, (query entails B1) and (query entails B3).

- **Justification whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root:**
  - The root node R1 states that the lessor cannot cancel the lease agreement with the sublessee due to lawful subleasing. However, it includes an exception for cases where the lessor has a right to cancel due to non-performance.
  - The query suggests that even in cases of non-performance (which would normally allow cancellation), the lessor may not assert cancellation against the sublessee, which seems to contradict the exception stated in Article 613(3).
  - Therefore, considering the most comparable scenario, (query disagree R1).

After re-justification, the conclusion remains that the query entails base-level factors B1 and B3 but disagrees with the root node R1's general stance on the condition allowing lessor cancellation against sublessees. 

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B3)
- (query disagree R1)

correct prediction case 104
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to evaluate the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if any damage is caused to the leased thing after the lessee receives it (excluding ordinary wear and aging degradation), the lessee has an obligation to restore the damaged thing when the lease is terminated, unless the damage is due to grounds not attributable to the lessee. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: The lessee is obligated to restore any damage to the leased thing at the termination of the lease.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: Damage caused by the lessee's actions.
- A2: Exclusions from restoration obligations, such as ordinary wear and aging degradation.
- A3: Grounds not attributable to the lessee.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors:
- B1 (under A1): Damage caused by misuse or neglect of the leased thing.
- B2 (under A2): Wear and tear from ordinary use.
- B3 (under A3): Natural disasters or third-party actions causing damage.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
Directed links include:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (B3 supports A3)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 denies R1)
- (A3 denies R1)

Given the query, "If The lessee is not obligated to restore any wear of the leased thing caused by the ordinary manner of using and making profit from it when the lease is terminated," we can see that:
- (query entails B2) because both consider the scenario where the damage is due to ordinary use.
  
Considering the root node R1, which states the lessee's obligation to restore damages at lease termination, and comparing it with the query, the query actually aligns with an exception to this rule (ordinary wear and tear), thus:
- (query disagree R1) because the query presents a scenario where restoration is not required, contrary to the general statement of R1.

However, upon reevaluation considering the structure and the specific wording of the provisions and the query, it's clear that the disagreement is based on understanding the conditions under which the lessee is not obligated to restore. The actual disagreement lies in the interpretation of when restoration is not required (in cases of ordinary wear and tear), which aligns with an exception to R1 rather than a direct contradiction. Thus, the justification regarding disagreement may require adjustment based on this nuanced understanding.

Upon careful reconsideration:
- The query directly pertains to B2, as it discusses ordinary wear and tear.
- Given that B2 supports A2 (exclusions from restoration obligations), and A2 denies R1 (under specific conditions like ordinary wear), the correct interpretation should reflect the conditional nature of the lessee's obligations.

Thus, a more accurate reflection considering the nuanced understanding would acknowledge that while there is an apparent disagreement due to the query focusing on an exception (ordinary wear), the structure supports recognizing this as part of the legal framework rather than a direct contradiction. The initial conclusion regarding disagreement may need refinement based on the conditional nature of restoration obligations outlined in the article and reflected in the ANGELIC structure.

Given this, the corrected output considering the nuanced interpretation should focus on the query's alignment with base-level factors and its implications for understanding the root node's applicability under specific conditions. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{(query entails B2)}$

wrong prediction case 105
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of the article is about the conditions under which a party that has cancelled a mandate must compensate for damage suffered by the other party.
   - **Root Node (R1):** A party that has cancelled a mandate is liable to the other party for compensation for loss or damage under certain conditions.

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the liability for compensation include:
     - **Abstract Factor (A1):** The cancellation of the mandate was at a time detrimental to the other party.
     - **Abstract Factor (A2):** The mandator cancelled the mandate for which the purpose includes interests for the mandatary, excluding profit obtained exclusively by receiving remuneration.
     - **Abstract Factor (A3):** There was a compelling reason for the cancellation.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - Refining A1:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The cancellation occurred at a time when it would cause significant financial loss to the other party.
     - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The cancellation happened during a critical phase of the mandated project, impacting the other party's interests.
   - Refining A2:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The mandate's purpose included shared business interests between the mandator and mandatary.
   - Refining A3:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B4):** The compelling reason was due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the cancelling party.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **(A1 supports R1)**: Cancellation at a detrimental time supports the liability for compensation.
   - **(A2 supports R1)**: Cancelling a mandate that includes interests for the mandatary supports the liability for compensation.
   - **(A3 denies R1)**: Existence of a compelling reason denies the liability for compensation.
   - **(B1 supports A1)**: Significant financial loss due to timing supports the notion of cancellation at a detrimental time.
   - **(B2 supports A1)**: Cancellation during a critical phase supports the notion of cancellation at a detrimental time.
   - **(B3 supports A2)**: Shared business interests support the purpose including interests for the mandatary.
   - **(B4 supports A3)**: Unforeseen circumstances support the existence of a compelling reason.

Given the query: "A party that has cancelled a mandate, notwithstanding the time of the cancellation, is not liable to the other party for compensation for loss or damage."

- The query directly contradicts the conditions under which liability for compensation is established. It suggests no liability regardless of the timing or circumstances of the cancellation.
- **(query entails B4)**: Because the query implies that there could be a compelling reason (such as unforeseen circumstances) for the cancellation, which aligns with Base-Level Factor B4.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query disagrees with Root Node R1 because it states a blanket exemption from liability, whereas R1 conditions liability on specific factors such as the timing of the cancellation or the purpose of the mandate.

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and the implications of each factor:
- The disagreement between the query and R1 stands because the query negates any conditionality for liability.
- The entailment with B4 is nuanced but upon closer inspection, it's more about the implication of a compelling reason in the query rather than directly addressing unforeseen circumstances. Thus, while there's an initial alignment, the query's broader statement against liability complicates direct entailment without more specific context.

Therefore, focusing strictly on the provided structure and justification process:
- **(query disagree R1)** remains the primary conclusion due to the direct contradiction between the query's stance on liability and the conditions outlined in R1.

correct prediction case 106
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article states that "The provisions of this Section apply mutatis mutandis to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts." This means the legal conclusion or verdict is about the applicability of certain provisions to non-juridical act entrustments.

- **Root Node (R1):** The provisions of this section are applicable to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors here involve the nature of the entrustments (whether they constitute juridical acts or not) and the applicability of legal provisions to these entrustments.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The nature of the business entrustment (juridical act or not).
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Applicability of legal provisions to non-juridical act entrustments.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For A1, we can refine it further based on the type of business and the legal implications of being a juridical or non-juridical act. For A2, refinement could involve specific provisions and their applicability.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1) for A1:** Entrustments that are explicitly defined as not constituting juridical acts.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) for A2:** Specific legal provisions that are applicable mutatis mutandis to non-juridical act entrustments.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- **(A1 supports R1):** The clarification on the nature of the business entrustment supports the applicability of the provisions.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The principle that legal provisions can apply to non-juridical acts supports the root conclusion.
- **(B1 supports A1):** Specific instances of non-juridical act entrustments support the abstract factor regarding the nature of these entrustments.
- **(B2 supports A2):** Examples of applicable provisions support the abstract factor regarding applicability.

### Analysis of Query
The query states, "The provisions regarding mandate of juridical acts do not apply mutatis mutandis to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts."

- The query directly contradicts the root node (R1), which suggests that certain provisions are applicable to non-juridical act entrustments.
- However, upon closer inspection, it seems the query is discussing a different aspect or assumption about what is being applied (provisions regarding mandate of juridical acts) rather than directly addressing the applicability as stated in R1.

### Justification
Given the structure and analysis:
- The query does not directly entail any base-level factor because it introduces a distinction (mandate of juridical acts) not explicitly addressed by B1 or B2.
- **(Query disagree R1):** The query seems to disagree with the root node's conclusion regarding the applicability of provisions to non-juridical act entrustments, but this disagreement is based on a different premise (type of provision being discussed).

Upon re-justification:
- It becomes clear that the initial interpretation might have been too hasty in stating a direct disagreement without fully considering the implications of "mandate of juridical acts" versus the general applicability stated in R1.
- The core issue is whether the query's premise (about mandates of juridical acts) directly contradicts or aligns with the principle outlined in R1 and its supporting factors. Given the specific wording of both, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the initial disagreement assessment because the query introduces a new element not directly addressed by R1 or its factors.

Thus, the careful reconsideration leads to understanding that the query indeed presents a different scenario or consideration (regarding mandates) which wasn't explicitly covered by the constructed ANGELIC structure's nodes and links. This means the initial direct disagreement might have been premature without fully unpacking the implications of "mandate of juridical acts" in relation to R1's general statement about applicability.

Therefore, considering the output format requirements but acknowledging the nuanced understanding upon re-justification:
- **(Query disagree R1)** still stands as the closest representation given the direct contradiction in their statements, albeit with the recognition that this disagreement hinges on interpreting the scope and specifics of what provisions are being discussed (general applicability vs. mandates of juridical acts).

correct prediction case 107
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 649 is that if costs will be incurred in administering the mandated business, the mandator must pay an advance for those costs at the request of the mandatary.
   - Thus, the Root Node (R1) can be stated as: "The mandator is obligated to pay an advance for costs incurred in administering the mandated business upon the mandatary's request."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
     - A1: The existence of costs incurred in administering the mandated business.
     - A2: The request by the mandatary for an advance to cover these costs.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, a base-level factor could be:
     - B1: Costs are directly related to the administration of the mandated business.
   - For A2, a base-level factor could be:
     - B2: The mandatary has made a formal request for an advance to cover the costs.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - B1 supports A1 because if costs are directly related to the administration of the mandated business, it substantiates the existence of costs that need to be covered.
   - B2 supports A2 because a formal request by the mandatary is necessary for the mandator to be obligated to pay an advance.
   - A1 supports R1 because the existence of costs directly related to the administration of the mandated business is a condition for the mandator's obligation to pay an advance.
   - A2 supports R1 because the request by the mandatary triggers the mandator's obligation to pay.

Given the query: "The mandatary may not request the costs that are incurred in administering the mandated business until after having paid those costs."

- **Justification of Base-Level Factor Entailment:**
  - The query entails B2 because it discusses the conditions under which the mandatary can request costs, implying a scenario where a request for costs (or an advance) is being considered.

- **Agreement or Disagreement with the Root Node:**
  - The query disagrees with R1 because it suggests that the mandatary cannot request an advance until after paying the costs, which contradicts the article's statement that the mandator must pay an advance at the request of the mandatary if costs will be incurred.

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish or refute. Based on Article 655, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The grounds of termination of mandate cannot be asserted against the other party unless the other party was notified of or knew of the same.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion represented by the root node.
- **A1**: Notification or knowledge of the grounds for termination of mandate.
- **A2**: The occurrence of an event leading to the termination of mandate, as outlined in Article 653.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific conditions:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The mandatary was notified of the fact that the mandator is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceedings.
- Under **A2**, base-level factors could include:
  - **B2**: The mandator or mandatary dies.
  - **B3**: The mandator or mandatary is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding.
  - **B4**: The mandatary is subject to a decision for the commencement of guardianship.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- Each abstract factor and its base-level factors must have directed links indicating whether they support or deny the root node or another abstract factor.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Knowing or being notified of the grounds for termination supports the condition under which these grounds can be asserted.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Notification to the mandatary specifically supports the concept of notification or knowledge.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The occurrence of an event leading to termination indirectly supports the necessity of being able to assert these grounds, by making such assertion possible in the first place.
- **(B2, B3, B4 support A2)**: Each specific event supports the abstract concept of a terminating event.

### Analysis of Query
Given the query: "If a mandate is terminated because the mandator has become subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceedings, the mandator may not assert against the mandatary unless the mandatary was notified of or knew of the fact that the mandator is subject to the order commencing bankruptcy proceeding."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query specifically mentions a scenario where notification or knowledge (B1) is crucial for asserting grounds for termination.
- Comparing this with the root node R1, which discusses the necessity of notification or knowledge for asserting grounds of termination:
  - **(query agree R1)**: The query agrees with the root node that assertion of termination grounds requires notification or knowledge.

Justifying this agreement involves recognizing that both the query and the root node hinge on the principle that a party must be aware (notified or has knowledge) of the reason for mandate termination to have it asserted against them. This is a fundamental aspect of fairness in legal proceedings, ensuring that parties are not bound by agreements or obligations without their awareness of the circumstances leading to such bindings being dissolved or altered.

Upon re-justification, considering the specifics of Article 653 and the emphasis on notification/knowledge in Article 655, it's clear that the query directly aligns with the principle established by R1, further solidifying the conclusion that the query entails a base-level factor (B1) concerning notification and agrees with the root node (R1) regarding the necessity of such notification for asserting mandate termination grounds.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the task, let's break it down into steps according to the provided instructions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that "a partner may not independently exercise the rights with regard to a claim that is included in the partnership property based on that partner's interest in the claim." Thus, the root node can be formulated as:
- R1: A partner cannot independently exercise rights regarding a claim in the partnership property.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors here involve the nature of partnership property and the rights of partners within it. Two abstract factors can be identified:
- A1: The principle that partnership property is jointly owned.
- A2: The limitation on individual partners' ability to act independently regarding partnership assets.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- B1 (under A1): Partnership claims are considered joint assets, requiring collective decision-making.
- B2 (under A2): Partners' individual interests in a claim do not grant them independent authority over it.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Given the query "A partner may independently exercise the rights with regard to a monetary claim that is included in the partnership property in proportion to each co-owner's interest," let's analyze it against our constructed structure.

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement/Disagreement with Root
- The query suggests that a partner can act independently regarding a monetary claim within the partnership, which directly contradicts R1.
- However, considering the scenario presented by the query (exercising rights in proportion to each co-owner's interest), it seems to align more closely with considerations around individual interests and joint ownership. Thus, we might argue that the query entails a consideration similar to B2 but from an opposing viewpoint.

Therefore, given the direct opposition to R1's conclusion:
- The query disagrees with R1 because it suggests independence in exercising rights based on individual interest, contrary to the article's assertion.

Upon reevaluation for thoroughness and accuracy:
- The initial construction and analysis correctly apply the provided framework.
- The disagreement between the query and R1 remains consistent upon further consideration.

### Conclusion

correct prediction case 110
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 670 seeks to establish how partnership business decisions are made and executed. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1**: The partnership business is decided by the majority of the partners.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Decision-making process in partnerships.
- **A2**: Delegation of decision and execution to one or more partners or a third party.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors, we have:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: Majority voting among all partners.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: Delegation to one or more specific partners or a third party for decision-making and execution.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are established as follows:
- **B1 supports A1**: Because majority voting among all partners directly relates to the decision-making process in partnerships.
- **B2 supports A2**: Since delegating decision and execution tasks to specific individuals aligns with the concept of delegation within partnerships.
- **A1 supports R1**: As the decision-making process is fundamental to how partnership businesses are decided.
- **A2 denies R1**: Because if decisions can be delegated, it suggests not all decisions require a majority vote by all partners.

Given the query: "The partnership business is decided by the majority of the partners even if any person is delegated to be a person who executes business."

### Justification
- The query does not directly match any base-level factor but seems to challenge or clarify the scenario under **A2**, suggesting that delegation does not negate the requirement for majority decisions.
- However, based on Article 670(3), if there are two or more persons delegated to execute business, decisions among them are made by a majority. This implies that while delegation occurs, majority decision-making still applies within the group of executors.

Considering the evidence and scenario:
- **(query entails B1)**: Because the query emphasizes decision-making by the majority of partners, even in scenarios involving delegation.
  
Regarding agreement with the root node:
- The query seems to align with **R1** in emphasizing the role of majority decisions but introduces a nuance regarding delegation. However, upon closer examination and considering Article 670's provisions on delegation and majority decisions among executors:
- **(query agree R1)**: Since both emphasize the importance of majority decisions, whether among all partners or within a delegated group executing business.

Upon rejustification, considering the specifics of Article 670 and the query's focus on maintaining majority decision-making even with delegation:
- The initial assessment stands, as the query does indeed align with the principle of majority decision-making in partnerships, even when certain aspects are delegated.

wrong prediction case 111
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The outcome of Article 678(2) is that each partner may withdraw from a partnership if there is a compelling reason to do so, even if the duration of the partnership is specified.
   - Therefore, the Root Node (R1) can be stated as: "A partner may withdraw from a partnership due to a compelling reason."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
     - A1: Specification of partnership duration does not preclude withdrawal.
     - A2: Existence of a compelling reason for withdrawal.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, we can refine it into:
     - B1: The partnership agreement explicitly allows for termination due to unforeseen circumstances.
     - B2: Legal precedents support the principle that specified durations do not necessarily bind partners in all scenarios.
   - For A2, we can refine it into:
     - B3: Compelling reasons include significant changes in personal circumstances.
     - B4: Compelling reasons include material breaches by other partners.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - Each abstract factor supports the root node:
     - (A1 supports R1)
     - (A2 supports R1)
   - Base-level factors support their respective abstract factors:
     - (B1 supports A1)
     - (B2 supports A1)
     - (B3 supports A2)
     - (B4 supports A2)

Given the query, "Even if the duration of the partnership is specified, each partner may withdraw if there is a compelling reason to do so," let's analyze its relationship with the constructed structure:

- The query directly aligns with the Root Node (R1) because it states the same condition under which a partner may withdraw from a partnership.
- The query also entails Base-Level Factors B3 and B4 indirectly, as it mentions "a compelling reason" without specifying what those reasons are. However, since B3 and B4 provide examples of such compelling reasons, we can say that the query considers scenarios similar to those described by these base-level factors.

Justification:
- The query entails Base-Level Factors because it discusses withdrawal based on compelling reasons, which aligns with the scenarios considered by B3 and B4.
- The query agrees with Root Node R1 because both state that a partner may withdraw due to a compelling reason, even if the partnership duration is specified.

Output:
- (query entails B3)
- (query entails B4)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 112
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and query, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 677-2(2) is that a new partner admitted to a partnership after it is formed is not liable for obligations arising before their admission. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: A new partner in a partnership is not liable for the partnership's pre-admission obligations.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: The timing of the partner's admission to the partnership.
- A2: The nature of partnership liabilities and how they are distributed among partners.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1, we get:
- B1: The partner was admitted after the partnership was formed.
- B2: The obligations in question arose before the partner's admission.

For A2, we could refine it to:
- B3: Partnership liabilities are generally shared among all partners unless otherwise specified by law or agreement.
- B4: New partners are not retroactively liable for debts incurred before their joining, as per the legal principle stated.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A1
- B3 supports A2
- B4 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Given the query: "A new partner that is admitted to a partnership after it is formed is not liable to perform the obligations of the partnership that arose before that partner's admission."

### Justification
The query directly aligns with the scenario described by B1 and B2, which are base-level factors considering the timing of the partner's admission and the nature of the obligations. Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)

Moreover, the query agrees with the root node R1, as both state that a new partner admitted after the partnership's formation is not liable for pre-admission obligations.
- (query agree R1)

Upon reevaluation, considering the provided structure and the context of the query, it's clear that the initial justification aligns with the logical framework established. The query indeed entails base-level factors B1 and B2, focusing on the partner's admission timing and the pre-existing obligations. Moreover, there is agreement between the query and the root node R1 regarding the liability of new partners for pre-admission obligations.

Therefore, the final justification confirms:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query, we follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article states, "A partner may not seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation." This establishes the root node as:
- **R1**: A partner cannot seek division of partnership property before liquidation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Consent of partners.
This factor is crucial because it could potentially validate or invalidate the conclusion based on whether partners agree to certain actions.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1, we have:
- **B1**: Consent of the majority of partners.
This base-level factor directly applies to specific conditions where the majority's consent could influence the legal outcome.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are as follows:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The consent of the majority of partners would support the abstract factor of partner consent.
- **(A1 denies R1)**: If there is consent among partners, it could deny the root node's conclusion that a partner cannot seek division before liquidation.

### ANGELIC Structure Formation
The structure now includes:
- **R1**: A partner cannot seek division of partnership property before liquidation.
- **A1**: Consent of partners.
- **B1**: Consent of the majority of partners.
With links: (B1 supports A1) and (A1 denies R1).

### Query Analysis
The query states, "A partner may seek the division of the partnership property before liquidation if the consent of the majority of partners exists."
This query directly relates to **B1** because it mentions the condition of having the majority of partners' consent.

- **(query entails B1)**: The query indeed considers a scenario where the consent of the majority of partners is present, aligning with base-level factor B1.

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node
The root node **R1** states that a partner cannot seek division before liquidation. However, the query suggests an exception to this rule based on the majority's consent.
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query disagrees with the absolute stance of R1 by introducing a condition (majority consent) under which a partner can seek division before liquidation.

Justifying again:
Upon reevaluation, it becomes clear that the initial analysis correctly identifies the relationships between the query, base-level factors, and the root node. The query does indeed align with **B1** due to its emphasis on majority consent, and it challenges the absolute nature of **R1** by providing a conditional exception.

Thus, the correct output remains:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

correct prediction case 114
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if an obligor has paid money or delivered anything as performance of an obligation that has not yet fallen due, the obligor may not demand the return of the money paid or thing delivered.

- **Root Node (R1):** An obligor cannot demand the return of prematurely paid money or delivered items for an obligation not yet due.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The payment or delivery was made by mistake.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The payment or delivery was made with full knowledge of the obligation's due date.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The obligor mistakenly believed the due date had arrived.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The obligor was aware of the premature nature of the payment or delivery but proceeded anyway.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: If the payment or delivery was made by mistake, it supports the conclusion that the obligor cannot demand return.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: If the payment or delivery was made knowingly, it challenges the conclusion about demanding a return.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Mistakenly believing the due date had arrived is a scenario where the payment or delivery was made by mistake.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Proceeding with payment or delivery despite knowing it's premature is a scenario of full knowledge.

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation Format
Follows the specified format:
- Root Node labeled as R1.
- Abstract Factors labeled as A1, A2.
- Base-Level Factors labeled as B1, B2.
- Links represented with support or deny relationships (e.g., **(B1 supports A1)**).

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement/Disagreement with Root
Given the query: "A person who misunderstands due to negligence that the due date arrives and has paid money or delivered anything as performance of an obligation that has not yet fallen due may demand the return of the money paid or thing delivered before the arrival of the due date."

- The query **entails B1** because both consider scenarios where there's a misunderstanding about the due date, albeit the query specifies negligence.
- However, considering the nuances, the query actually suggests a scenario where, despite the misunderstanding (negligence), the person may demand return, which seems to **disagree with R1**, as R1 generally states that an obligor cannot demand return for premature payments or deliveries.

Upon rejustification:
- The core of the disagreement lies in how negligence affects the ability to demand a return. The original article suggests that mistakes might allow for returns (as implied by A1), but it does not explicitly address negligence as a factor. Thus, the query introduces a nuance not directly covered by R1 or its supporting/denying factors.
- The correct interpretation hinges on whether negligence is seen as akin to mistake (in which case A1 and thus B1 might apply) or if it's viewed more critically, implying a level of responsibility that precludes demanding a return (potentially aligning more with the spirit of R1).

Therefore, considering the specific phrasing of the query and its focus on negligence leading to a misunderstanding:
- **(query entails B1)** because both deal with misunderstandings about due dates.
- **(query disagree R1)** due to the introduction of negligence as a factor potentially allowing for demanding a return, which complicates the straightforward application of R1. 

However, this interpretation requires careful consideration of legal principles regarding mistake, negligence, and their implications on contractual obligations, suggesting that:
- The query's alignment with B1 might be nuanced by the specific legal context.
- The disagreement with R1 could depend on jurisdictional interpretations of negligence and mistake in contract law.

In conclusion, based on the provided framework and analysis:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 707 is that if a person who is not an obligor performs an obligation by mistake and certain conditions are met (e.g., the obligee acts in good faith and loses the claim by prescription), this person may not demand the return of the subject matter of the performance. Thus, the Root Node can be stated as:
- R1: A non-obligor who mistakenly performs an obligation cannot demand the return of the subject matter if certain conditions are met.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that validate or invalidate the conclusion in R1 include:
- A1: The performance of the obligation by a non-obligor was due to mistake.
- A2: The obligee acted in good faith regarding the loss, damage, waiver, or prescription of the claim.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2 into more specific conditions gives us:
- B1: The obligee lost the claim by prescription.
- B2: The obligee damaged the instrument in good faith.
- B3: The obligee waived the security in good faith.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor supports the occurrence of the root legal determination. Each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor:
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1
- B1 supports A2
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A2

Given the query: "A person who misunderstands that the person is an obligor and has performed an obligation may not demand the return of subject matter of the performance if the obligee, acting in good faith, has lost the claim by prescription."

Justifying whether the query entails base-level factors:
- The query mentions a situation where the obligee loses the claim by prescription, which aligns with B1.
Therefore: (query entails B1).

Justifying whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root R1 in the comparable situation:
- Both the query and R1 conclude that under certain conditions (including the loss of claim by prescription due to good faith actions by the obligee), a non-obligor who mistakenly performs an obligation cannot demand the return of what they performed.
Therefore: (query agree R1).

After rejustification, considering all details provided:
The conclusion remains consistent.

correct prediction case 116
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 509 is to establish that the obligor of certain obligations may not duly assert a set-off against the obligee under specific conditions. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The obligor cannot assert a set-off against the obligee for obligations related to compensation for loss or damage based on torts committed in bad faith or for death/injury to person.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: The nature of the obligation (e.g., whether it's based on a tort committed in bad faith).
- **A2**: The type of compensation sought (e.g., for death, injury to person, or other types of loss/damage).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: The obligation is for compensation for loss or damage based on a tort committed in bad faith.
  - **B2**: The obligation is for compensation for loss or damage for death or injury to person (excluding those based on bad faith).
- Under **A2**, no further refinement is necessary as it's already covered by the specific scenarios of **B1** and **B2**.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
The directed links are:
- (**B1 supports A1**): Having an obligation based on a tort committed in bad faith directly supports the condition under which a set-off cannot be asserted.
- (**B2 supports A1**): Similarly, obligations for compensation due to death or injury support the conditions under which a set-off is not permissible.
- (**A1 denies R1**): The existence of these specific types of obligations (tort in bad faith or compensation for death/injury) denies the obligor's ability to assert a set-off against the obligee, which is the root conclusion.

### Justification
Given the query: "If a person that holds a monetary claim has borne an obligation for compensation for loss or damage for injury to the obligor of that monetary claim, the person may not duly assert against the obligor, a set-off using the monetary claim against the obligation for compensation."

- (**query entails B2**): The query specifically mentions "injury to the obligor," which aligns with the scenario described in **B2**, concerning obligations for compensation for loss or damage due to injury.
  
Considering the structure and the query, we examine if the query agrees or disagrees with the root node **R1**:
- (**query agree R1**): The query's conclusion that the person may not duly assert a set-off using the monetary claim against the obligation for compensation aligns with the root node **R1**, which states that under certain conditions (like those described in **B2**), the obligor cannot assert a set-off.

Upon re-justification, the analysis holds because both the query and **R1** address scenarios where specific types of obligations (especially those related to injury, as in **B2**) preclude the assertion of a set-off by the obligor against the obligee. Therefore, the justification that the query entails **B2** and agrees with **R1** remains accurate based on the provided legal provisions and the constructed ANGELIC structure.

The final answer is: 
(query entails B2)
(query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 117
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the query in relation to this structure, we follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that an act voidable due to mistake, fraud, or duress can only be rescinded by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention or their agent/successor. Thus, the root node is:
- **R1**: An act voidable on grounds of mistake, fraud, or duress may be rescinded only by the person who made the defective manifestation or their agent/successor.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors substantiating the conclusion are:
- **A1**: The requirement for the person who made the defective manifestation to initiate rescission.
- **A2**: The role of agents or successors in initiating rescission on behalf of the original party.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A1 and A2, we get:
- **B1**: The person who made the defective manifestation due to a mistake must initiate rescission.
- **B2**: Agents or successors can initiate rescission on behalf of the original party in cases of mistake.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Since B1 specifies who can initiate rescission due to a mistake, it directly supports A1.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: As B2 outlines the role of agents or successors in initiating rescission, it supports A2.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The requirement for the original party (or their agent/successor) to initiate rescission directly supports R1.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The inclusion of agents or successors as parties who can initiate rescission also supports R1.

Given the query, "An act that is voidable on the grounds of a mistake may also be rescinded by the successor of the contractual status of the person who made the manifestation of intention by mistake," we analyze its relation to our constructed structure:

- The query **entails B2**, because it discusses the role of successors in rescinding an act voidable due to mistake, aligning with the scenario outlined in B2.
  
To assess agreement or disagreement with R1:
- The query and R1 both acknowledge the role of successors (among others) in rescinding acts voidable due to mistakes. Therefore, the query **agrees with R1**.

After rejustification, considering the emphasis on successors as part of those who can rescind such acts and aligning this with B2 and ultimately supporting R1's broader statement on who can initiate rescission:

- The final assessment remains that **(query entails B2)** and **(query agrees R1)**. 

Output format:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The outcome of Article 153 is to establish that the postponement or renewal of a prescription period has limited applicability between parties and their successors under specific conditions.

- **Root Node (R1):** The postponement of expiry of prescription period or its renewal affects only the parties with respect to whom grounds have arisen and their successors.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Existence of grounds for postponing the expiry of prescription period under Articles 147, 148, 149 through 151.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The relationship between parties and their successors in the context of prescription periods.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1 gives us:

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Grounds for postponing expiry under Articles 147 or 148.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Grounds for renewing prescription period under the same articles.

And refining A2 might not be necessary as it directly relates to the conditions under which the postponement is effective without needing further breakdown in this context.

### 4. Establish Directed Links

- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- Since A2 directly pertains to the applicability of the prescription period's postponement or renewal, it inherently supports R1.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The existence of grounds under specific articles supports the limited applicability of prescription period adjustments.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: The consideration of parties and their successors in these legal matters supports the conclusion about who is affected.

### Node Naming Convention and Link Representation

Adheres to the specified format.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "The postponement of expiry of prescription period is not effective against the successors of the parties with respect to whom grounds to postpone the expiry of prescription period have arisen."

- **Justification**: The query directly contradicts the essence of Article 153, which states that the postponement or renewal is indeed effective between the parties and their successors when grounds have arisen. Therefore, it seems to misunderstand or misinterpret the applicability as stated in the article.

### Conclusion

- The query **disagrees** with the Root Node (R1) because R1 indicates that the postponement of expiry of prescription period or its renewal is effective between parties and their successors under certain conditions, whereas the query suggests it's not effective against these successors.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 187(1) is that a successor to a possessor may assert either their own possession only or their own possession together with that of the predecessor. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A successor to a possessor has the right to choose how they assert their possession.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The successor's right to assert their own possession.
- **A2**: The predecessor's influence on the successor's rights of possession.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, we can refine it further into:
- **B1**: The successor's ability to assert their own possession independently.
- **B2**: The legal recognition of the successor's possession as separate from the predecessor's.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Given the structure, the directed links are established as follows:
- (**B1** supports **A1**): The ability to assert independent possession supports the successor's right to choose their assertion method.
- (**B2** supports **A1**): Legal recognition of separate possession also supports this right.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): The successor's right to assert their own possession directly supports the root conclusion.
- (**A2** could support or deny **R1**, but without further refinement, its direct link is not explicitly defined in the given context).

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root
Given the query: "A universal successor to a possessor may also assert the successor's own possession only," let's analyze it against our structure.

- The query directly relates to **B1**, as it discusses the successor's ability to assert their possession independently, which is a base-level factor of the abstract factor **A1** (the successor's right to assert their own possession). Thus, (**query entails B1**).

Considering the root node **R1**, the query essentially agrees with the verdict presented by **R1**. The root node establishes that a successor has the choice in how they assert their possession, and the query specifies a scenario (a universal successor) where this choice is also applicable, affirming the flexibility in asserting possession as stated in **R1**. Therefore, (**query agree R1**).

After careful reconsideration, the analysis holds true because the query specifically addresses a situation that aligns with the base-level factor **B1**, supporting the abstract factor **A1**, which in turn supports the root node **R1**. The scenario presented by the query does not introduce conditions that would contradict or deny the rights established in **R1** but rather exemplifies a specific application of those rights.

Thus, the justified output is:
- (**query entails B1**)
- (**query agree R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article concludes that a claim one co-owner holds against other co-owners with respect to the property in co-ownership may be exercised against their specific successors. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A claim by a co-owner against another co-owner regarding co-owned property can be exercised against the latter's specific successors.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The legal principle of successor liability in co-ownership, which may allow claims to be transferred to successors under certain conditions.
- **A2**: The nature of the claim and its specificity to the co-owned property, which could affect whether it can be exercised against successors.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
- **B1**: Successors who directly inherit or acquire the specific portion of the co-owned property from the original co-owner are liable for claims related to that property.
For **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
- **B2**: Claims that are specifically tied to the co-owned property's maintenance, improvement, or other direct financial obligations can be exercised against successors.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1 supports A1**): The concept of successor liability directly supports the principle that claims can be transferred.
- (**B2 supports A2**): The specificity of claims to the property supports the notion that such claims can be exercised against successors.
- (**A1 supports R1**): The legal principle of successor liability in co-ownership supports the conclusion that claims can be exercised against successors.
- (**A2 supports R1**): The nature of the claim being specific to the co-owned property supports the conclusion.

Given the query: "A claim that a co-owner (A) holds against another co-owner (B) with respect to the property in co-ownership may not be exercised against B's specific successors."

### Justification
- The query entails **B1** because both consider the scenario of exercising claims against successors regarding co-owned property, although they reach opposite conclusions.
- However, upon closer examination, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in directly linking the query to **B1** without considering the negation presented by the query. The query actually presents a counter-scenario to what **R1** and its supporting factors propose.

### Rejustification
Upon reevaluation:
- The query does not align with **R1** because it suggests that claims may not be exercised against successors, which directly contradicts **R1**.
- Therefore, the correct statement should reflect disagreement with **R1**, given the query's assertion is opposite to what **R1** concludes.

Thus, the output format reflecting this analysis would be:
- (query disagrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and address the query, let's follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 407 is to establish that once the obligor manifests the intention to exercise the right to choose under an alternative obligation, this manifestation may not be withdrawn without the consent of the counterparty. Therefore, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: The obligor's manifestation of intention to exercise the right to choose cannot be withdrawn without the counterparty's consent.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: The existence of an alternative obligation.
- A2: The obligor's manifestation of intention to exercise the right to choose.
- A3: The principle that a manifestation of intention under such obligations has specific consequences regarding withdrawal.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2 and A3:
- B1: The manifestation is made before the due date of the obligation.
- B2: The manifestation is made with the understanding that it binds the obligor to a specific performance.
- B3: The counterparty has not given consent for the withdrawal.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- B1 supports A2
- B2 supports A2
- B3 supports A3
- A2 supports R1
- A3 supports R1

Given the query: "If the obligor of an alternative obligation manifests the intention to exercise the right to choose, the manifestation may not be withdrawn without the consent of the obligee even before the due date of the obligation."

### Justification
The query entails B1 because it specifically mentions the scenario where the manifestation is made before the due date. Therefore: (query entails B1).

Considering R1 and the context provided by the query, both agree that once the obligor has manifested the intention to choose under an alternative obligation, this choice cannot be withdrawn without the consent of the counterparty, even if it's before the due date. Thus, the query agrees with R1: (query agree R1).

After re-justification, considering the details and the context provided by the articles and the query, the conclusion remains that the query entails a base-level factor related to the timing of the manifestation and agrees with the root node regarding the non-withdrawal of the obligor's choice without consent. 

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article seeks to establish that "the manifestation of intention to cancel may not be revoked." Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: The manifestation of intention to cancel cannot be revoked.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
To validate or invalidate R1, we need to consider key legal factors related to contract law and cancellation rights. Two abstract factors come into play:
- A1: Existence of a contractual provision allowing for cancellation.
- A2: Legal principles governing revocation of intentions in contractual agreements.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- B1: Specific contract terms explicitly stating that cancellation manifestations are irrevocable.
- B2: Statutory laws or precedents that uphold the principle of non-revocation for cancellation intentions in similar contractual contexts.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Directed links are established as follows:
- B1 supports A1
- B2 supports A2
- A1 supports R1
- A2 supports R1

Given these definitions and relationships, let's address the query: "The manifestation of intention to cancel may not be revoked."

### Justification of Query Entailment with Base-Level Factors:
The query directly pertains to the irrevocability of cancellation intentions. Given that B1 considers contract terms allowing for such irrevocability and B2 looks at legal precedents upholding this principle, we can say:
- (query entails B1) because both consider scenarios where cancellation manifestations are intended to be final.

### Justification of Agreement with Root Node:
Considering the query's stance on the non-revocation of cancellation intentions, it aligns with R1's conclusion that such manifestations cannot be revoked. Therefore:
- (query agree R1)

Upon reevaluation, considering the structured approach and the definitions provided, the justifications remain consistent. The query directly addresses a scenario covered by B1 and supports the conclusion stated in R1, affirming the initial analysis.

Thus, the final answer remains that the query entails base-level factor B1 and agrees with root node R1.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 96 seeks to establish that a manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- R1: A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors that either substantiate or undermine this legal conclusion include:
- A1: Fraud or duress undermines the validity of a manifestation of intention.
- A2: Knowledge of the counterparty about the fraud or duress affects the voidability of the manifestation.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into base-level factors, we get:
- B1: The manifestation of intention is made under duress induced by a third party.
- B2: The counterparty does not know that the manifestation of intention was made under fraud or duress.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links among these factors can be established as follows:
- B1 supports A1, because being under duress is a condition that undermines the validity of an agreement.
- B2 denies A2, since lack of knowledge by the counterparty affects whether the manifestation can be considered voidable.

Given the directed link criteria and node naming convention, we have:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 denies A2)

### Justification
The query states: "In cases where duress was induced by a third party, if the counterparty of the manifestation of intention does not know of that fact, the person who makes the manifestation cannot rescind the manifestation of intention."
This scenario is directly related to Base-Level Factor B1 and indirectly through its context to A1. Hence:
- (query entails B1)

Comparing this with the Root Node R1, which states a manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable, the query actually presents a condition under which such a manifestation might not be rescinded by the person making it due to lack of knowledge by the counterparty. This suggests a specific scenario where the general rule of R1 may face an exception or condition:
- (query disagree R1)

Upon reevaluation for clarity and accuracy in justifying whether the query entails base-level factors and agrees or disagrees with the root, the initial assessment holds true given the specifics of the legal provisions provided. The query directly pertains to scenarios where duress is induced by a third party and the counterparty's lack of knowledge impacts the voidability of the manifestation of intention, thus aligning with the considerations of base-level factor B1 and its implications on the broader rule stated in R1.

Therefore, the final justification stands as:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the articles seek to establish. Based on Article 96 and Article 709, the primary focus is on the validity of a manifestation of intention when fraud or duress is involved, and the liability for damages resulting from infringement of rights or legally protected interests.

- **R1:** A manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable.
- **R2:** A person who infringes on another's rights or legally protected interests is liable to compensate for damage.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These factors are the key legal conditions that validate or invalidate the conclusion represented by the root node.

- **A1:** Presence of fraud or duress in the manifestation of intention.
- **A2:** Knowledge of the second party regarding the fraud committed by a third party.
- **A3:** Intentional or negligent infringement of rights or legally protected interests.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific conditions:

- **B1:** The person making the manifestation believes a fictitious explanation provided by the counterparty without any intention of fraud from the counterparty.
- **B2:** The second party was aware or should have been aware that the manifestation was induced by fraud.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor and base-level factor must be linked to either support or deny the root node or another abstract factor.

- (**A1 supports R1**): The presence of fraud or duress directly supports the voidability of a manifestation of intention.
- (**A2 denies R1**): If the second party knew or should have known about the fraud, it affects the voidability under certain conditions.
- (**B1 supports A1**): Believing a fictitious explanation without an intention of fraud from the counterparty can be seen as a form of fraud or duress influencing the manifestation.
- (**B2 denies A2**): If the second party was not aware and could not have known about the fraud, it impacts their liability.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "In cases where the person who makes the manifestation believes a fictitious explanation of the counterparty and makes a manifestation of intention, if there was no intention of fraud for the counterparty, the person who makes the manifestation will not be rescued under Civil Code."

- **(query entails B1)**: The scenario described in the query aligns with base-level factor B1, where the person making the manifestation believes a fictitious explanation without an intention of fraud from the counterparty.
  
To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with the root node (R1), we consider the context provided by Article 96 and the specifics of the scenario:

- The query suggests that if there was no intention of fraud from the counterparty, and the person making the manifestation believes a fictitious explanation, they will not be rescued under Civil Code. This implies that the manifestation might still be considered valid (not voidable) under these specific circumstances, as it does not fit the typical conditions for fraud or duress as outlined in Article 96.

- **(query disagree R1)**: The query seems to suggest a scenario where the manifestation of intention might not be voidable due to the lack of fraudulent intent from the counterparty, even though the person making the manifestation was deceived. This could be interpreted as disagreeing with the general principle that manifestations based on fraud or duress are voidable (R1), under the specific conditions described.

However, upon closer examination and considering the nuances of legal interpretations:

- The query's disagreement might stem from a misunderstanding or a need for clarification regarding what constitutes "fraud" or "duress" in the context of Article 96. If the counterparty did not intend to defraud but the manifestation was still made under false pretenses, it could potentially fall under duress or fraud if those pretenses were knowingly false and intended to deceive by a third party or through negligence.

- Thus, the initial conclusion might need refinement based on the specifics of legal definitions and the context in which "fraud" or "duress" is considered. The query highlights the complexity of applying legal principles to specific scenarios and the importance of precise language and understanding of legal terminology.

Upon reevaluation, considering the complexities and the need for precision in legal interpretations:

- The query's alignment with **B1** remains clear due to the scenario it describes.
- The agreement or disagreement with **R1** may depend on a nuanced understanding of "fraud" and "duress" as defined legally and how these terms apply to the specific circumstances described in the query.

Given this analysis, the output format reflecting the relationship between the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure is refined to accurately capture the complexity of legal interpretations and the potential for varying conclusions based on the specifics of each case.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions, we follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- R1: A manifestation of intention induced by fraud or duress is voidable.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The presence of fraud or duress in forming a manifestation of intention.
- A2: Knowledge by the second party of the fraud committed by a third party.
- A3: The concept of rescission and its implications on contracts formed under fraud.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these factors:
- B1 (under A1): The manifestation was directly induced by the fraud or duress, making it voidable.
- B2 (under A2): The second party's knowledge or potential knowledge of the third party's fraud affects the voidability of the manifestation.
- B3 (under A3): Rescission due to fraud does not affect a third party acting in good faith without negligence.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links
- B1 supports A1: The direct influence of fraud or duress on the manifestation of intention validates its voidability.
- B2 supports A2: If the second party knew or could have known about the fraud, it impacts the validity of the manifestation.
- B3 supports A3: Rescission's effect on third parties in good faith underlines the fairness principle in contract law.
- A1 supports R1: The presence of fraud or duress directly supports the conclusion that a manifestation of intention is voidable.
- A2 denies R1 (in specific conditions): If the second party was unaware and not negligent, it might limit the voidability of the manifestation under certain circumstances.
- A3 supports R1: The consideration for third parties in good faith without negligence further clarifies the conditions under which a manifestation can be considered voidable.

### Justification
Given the query "In cases where the person who makes the manifestation forms a contract based on the fraud of the other person, even if the obligation of the other person is not yet executed based on the contract, the person who makes the manifestation cannot refuse execution of his or her obligation for reason of fraud as long as the manifestation of intention is not rescinded," we analyze its relation to the constructed structure.

- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor**: The query considers a scenario where a contract was formed under fraud but focuses on the execution of obligations before rescission. This closely relates to B1 (the direct influence of fraud making a manifestation voidable) and B3 (rescission's implications, especially regarding good faith and negligence). However, it more directly entails considerations similar to B1 because both deal with the immediate effects of fraud on contractual obligations.

  Thus, **(query entails B1)**.

- **Query Agreement/Disagreement with Root Node**: The query suggests that until a manifestation is rescinded, obligations based on it should be executed despite being formed under fraud. This seems to disagree with R1, which states that a manifestation of intention induced by fraud or duress is voidable. The query's stance implies a more nuanced view where the voidability does not immediately negate all obligations without formal rescission.

  Thus, **(query disagrees R1)**.

Upon careful reconsideration, it becomes clear that the initial analysis correctly identifies the query's relation to B1 and its disagreement with R1. The structure provides a framework for understanding how fraud impacts contractual manifestations and obligations, highlighting the complexity of applying these principles in specific scenarios like the one described in the query.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that a manifestation of intention based on fraud or duress is voidable, and under certain conditions, its rescission may not be asserted against a third party in good faith acting without negligence. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- **R1:** A manifestation of intention induced by fraud is voidable.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The presence of fraud or duress in the manifestation of intention.
- **A2:** The knowledge or potential knowledge of the second party regarding the fraud.
- **A3:** The good faith and lack of negligence of a third party.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, we can have:
  - **B1:** The buyer deceives the seller, which is a form of fraud.
- Under **A2**, we consider:
  - **B2:** The second party's knowledge or potential knowledge about the fraud when accepting the manifestation of intention.
- Under **A3**, considering:
  - **B3:** A third party acts in good faith and without negligence regarding the establishment of a mortgage on the land.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **B1 supports A1** because deception is a form of fraud.
- **B2 supports A2** as it directly addresses the condition of knowledge about the fraud.
- **B3 supports A3** since acting in good faith and without negligence is crucial for a third party's actions to be considered valid.
- **A1 supports R1** because the presence of fraud makes the manifestation voidable.
- **A2 denies R1** under specific conditions, as it introduces scenarios where rescission may not be asserted against certain parties.
- **A3 denies R1** in cases where a third party's good faith and lack of negligence prevent the rescission from being asserted against them.

### Justification
Given the query: "In cases where a buyer who deceives a seller receives the transfer of ownership of land, before the seller rescinds his or her manifestation of intention due to fraud, even if someone has accepted the establishment of a mortgage of the land without knowing of the fraud, the seller can revoke the manifestation of intention."
- **(query entails B1)** because it involves deception by the buyer, which is a base-level factor under A1.
- To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with R1, we must analyze the scenario presented. The query suggests that despite the involvement of a third party (who accepted the establishment of a mortgage without knowledge of the fraud), the seller can still revoke the manifestation due to fraud. This aligns with **R1** under the condition that the presence of fraud makes the manifestation voidable, regardless of subsequent actions by third parties who are unaware of the fraud.

Therefore, considering the conditions and factors involved:
- **(query agrees R1)** because both the query and R1 conclude that a manifestation of intention induced by fraud can be revoked or is voidable, despite the involvement of third parties under certain conditions. 

After re-justification, the conclusion remains consistent with the initial analysis based on the provided legal provisions and the structure of the ANGELIC framework.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 97 seeks to establish when a manifestation of intention becomes effective in forming a contract, particularly focusing on the timing and conditions under which such manifestations are considered effective.

- **Root Node (R1):** A manifestation of intention is effective when it reaches the other party.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The timing and method of notice.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The capacity and conditions of the parties involved at the time of sending or receiving the notice.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:

- Under A1, we consider how the notice is given and received:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Notice reaches the other party without any interference.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The other party prevents notice from reaching them without a legitimate reason.

- Under A2, we look at the capacity of parties:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The person making the manifestation has the legal capacity to act when sending the notice.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B4):** Changes in the sender's capacity after sending the notice do not affect its effectiveness.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)** because if notice reaches without interference, it aligns with the timing and method of effective notice.
- **(B2 supports A1)** since preventing notice without a reason still implies the intended effect at the time it would have normally reached.
- **(B3 supports A2)** as having legal capacity is crucial for the effectiveness of the manifestation.
- **(B4 supports A2)** because changes in capacity post-sending do not impair the manifestation's effect.

### Justification
Given the query: "The effect of manifestation of intention occurs when it arrives at the counterparty, and thus, a contract with a person at a distance forms when the manifestation of intention of acceptance arrives at the counterparty."

- **(query entails B1)** because both consider the scenario where notice effectively reaches the other party as the point of contract formation.
- Given that the root node R1 focuses on the effectiveness of a manifestation of intention upon reaching the other party, and the query essentially states the same principle regarding contract formation at a distance upon arrival of acceptance:
  - **(query agree R1)**.

Upon rejustification, considering the details provided in Article 97 and the structure formed, it's clear that both the query and the root node emphasize the importance of the manifestation reaching the other party for it to be effective. Thus, the initial justification stands as accurate based on the information given and the context of contract law principles regarding offer and acceptance.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if a person with qualified legal capacity fails to send a definite answer within a specified period regarding whether they will ratify an act, they are deemed to have ratified that act.

- **Root Node (R1):** A person is deemed to have ratified an act if they fail to respond within the specified period.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors include:
- The demand for ratification by the other party.
- The failure to send a definite answer within the specified period.
- The legal capacity of the person involved in the dealings.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Demand for ratification has been made.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Failure to respond within the specified period.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Legal capacity of the person to act or ratify.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A2 and A3 into more specific conditions:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The demand for ratification was made before the person gained full legal capacity.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The person under curatorship or assistance fails to get their curator or assistant to ratify within the specified period.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: The demand for ratification is a prerequisite for the legal conclusion.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Failure to respond leads to the assumption of ratification.
- **(A3 denies R1)**: If the person lacks the legal capacity, the act might not be considered ratified without proper representation or assistance.
- **(B1 supports A2)**: This scenario is a specific instance where failure to respond within the period leads to ratification.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Another scenario where failure to secure ratification from a curator or assistant leads to the act being deemed rescinded, which contrasts with but informs the understanding of ratification.

Given the query: "In cases where, against a demand of whether or not to ratify an act of a person with limited capacity, a statutory agent issues notification of refusal to ratify within the specified period, and it arrives after the lapse of the period, it is deemed as having been ratified."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query considers a scenario similar to B1, involving a demand for ratification and implications of timing on the decision.
  
Considering the root node R1 and the query:
- **(query agree R1)**: Both the query and R1 conclude that failure to meet the deadline for responding about ratification leads to the act being deemed ratified.

Justifying again with careful consideration, the conclusion holds because both the structure derived from the legal provisions and the query pertain to the implications of not responding or not meeting deadlines in the context of ratifying acts, leading to a default position of ratification under specific conditions. 

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 97 seeks to establish that a manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party, with specific conditions regarding prevention of notice, death, loss of mental capacity, or restrictions on legal capacity.

- **Root Node (R1):** A contract becomes effective upon the manifestation of intention reaching the other party.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
Key factors that either substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- The effectiveness of notice in creating a legally binding agreement.
- The impact of the sender's capacity to act after sending the notice.
- The role of prevention of notice by the recipient without a legitimate reason.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Effectiveness of Notice
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Capacity of Sender After Sending Notice
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Prevention of Notice

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1, we consider specific scenarios affecting notice effectiveness.
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Death of the Offeree Before Arrival of Notice
- This directly applies to the scenario where the offeree dies before receiving the manifestation of intention.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(A1 supports R1):** The effectiveness of notice generally supports the contract becoming effective.
- **(B1 denies A1):** If the offeree dies before the notice arrives, it challenges the effectiveness of that notice in creating a legally binding agreement.

Given this structure:
- **Query:** After the manifestation of intention of acceptance is issued for the petition for a contract, in cases where the offeree dies before the arrival, if the counterparty knows of the fact of the death of the offeree, the contract does not become effective.
  
- The query directly relates to a scenario described by Base-Level Factor **B1**, concerning the death of the offeree before notice arrival.

- **Justification:** 
  - (query entails B1) because both consider the scenario where the offeree's death occurs before receiving the manifestation of intention.
  - Given that **B1 denies A1** and **A1 supports R1**, if B1 is applicable, it would imply a disagreement with the general statement of R1 under the specific conditions described in B1. Thus, (query disagree R1) because, under the condition of the offeree's death before notice arrival and the counterparty knowing this fact, the contract does not become effective, contrary to the general principle stated by R1.

- **Rejustification:** Upon reconsideration, the analysis holds true as it correctly applies the logical structure provided by the ANGELIC framework. The scenario described in the query aligns with B1, which challenges the effectiveness of notice (A1), thereby disagreeing with the root conclusion under specific conditions. 

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish the effectiveness of a manifestation of intention in contractual contexts, particularly focusing on when such manifestations become effective and under what conditions they can be revoked or remain valid.

- **Root Node (R1):** A manifestation of intention becomes effective at the time notice thereof reaches the other party, considering exceptions for prevention without legitimate reason and the effect of changes in legal capacity after sending the notice.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The timing and method of notice delivery.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Legitimate reasons for preventing notice receipt.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Changes in the sender's legal capacity post-notification.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors:
- Under A1, we have:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The notice is delivered within a determined consent period.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The period for consent expires before or at the same time as the offer's arrival.
- Under A2, no direct refinement is necessary given the context of our query.
- Under A3:
  - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Death, loss of mental capacity, or legal restrictions on the sender after sending the notice.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
- **(B1 supports A1)**: The delivery within a consent period supports the factor related to timing and method.
- **(B2 supports A1)**: Expiration before or at arrival also pertains to the timing of the offer's effectiveness.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Effective notice delivery time directly supports the root conclusion about when manifestations become effective.
- **(B3 denies A3's impact on R1)**: Changes in sender capacity post-notification do not impair the manifestation's effect, thus supporting the root but through denying an undermining factor.

Given the query "Even if it is a contract offer with a determined consent period, if the period is before or at the same time as the arrival of the offer, it can be revoked.":

- **(query entails B2)**: The scenario described directly aligns with Base-Level Factor B2 regarding the timing of the consent period in relation to the offer's arrival.
  
Considering the query's context and comparing it with the Root Node R1:
- The query essentially questions the effectiveness of a manifestation under specific timing conditions (consent period expiring before or at the offer's arrival), which can be seen as challenging the general principle that manifestations become effective upon notice receipt, especially if such timing allows for revocation.
  
Thus, in terms of agreement with R1:
- **(query disagree R1)**: The query suggests a scenario where, due to specific conditions (the consent period ending before or at the offer's arrival), the manifestation might not be as straightforwardly effective as R1 states, implying disagreement under this particular circumstance.

After careful reconsideration, the analysis holds because it correctly identifies how the query pertains to a specific base-level factor and evaluates its stance relative to the root node based on the conditions presented.

wrong prediction case 131
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node should determine the outcome or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 113 and Article 115, the primary conclusion is about the conditions under which a contract concluded by an unauthorized agent binds the principal or can be rescinded.

- **Root Node (R1):** A contract concluded by an unauthorized agent does not bind the principal unless ratified, and the counterparty has the right to rescind before ratification, provided they were unaware of the lack of authority.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal conditions or principles that validate or invalidate the conclusion.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The principal's ratification of the contract.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The counterparty's knowledge of the agent's lack of authority at the time of contract conclusion.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The right to rescind based on unauthorized agency.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific conditions:

- **Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1:** Ratification by the principal after being informed of the contract details.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) under A2:** The counterparty's ignorance of the agent's unauthorized status at the time of agreement.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3) under A3:** Exercise of the right to rescind before the principal ratifies the contract.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
Directed links show how each factor supports or denies another:

- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A2)
- (B3 supports A3)
- (A1 supports R1) because ratification makes the contract binding.
- (A2 denies R1) since knowledge of lack of authority negates the right to rescind based on unauthorized agency.
- (A3 supports R1) as it directly pertains to the conditions under which a contract can be rescinded.

Given the query: "Even in cases where the principal ratifies an act of unauthorized agency toward an unauthorized agent, if the counterparty does not know of this fact, he or she can exercise the right to rescind."

- **Justification:** The query specifically addresses a scenario where the counterparty is unaware of the ratification and thus considers exercising the right to rescind. This directly aligns with conditions outlined in Article 115 and the concept of lack of knowledge about the agent's authority (A2) and the right to rescind (A3).

- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query entails base-level factor B2 because both consider scenarios where the counterparty's lack of knowledge about the agent's unauthorized status is crucial. Additionally, it relates to B3 as it discusses the exercise of the right to rescind.

- **Agreement with Root Node:** The query agrees with R1 because it supports the idea that a contract concluded by an unauthorized agent does not bind the principal unless ratified, and it specifies conditions under which the counterparty can exercise the right to rescind, aligning with the root node's conclusion.

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agrees R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this framework, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article discusses the scenario where a counterparty to an act of unauthorized agency can demand that the principal ratify or refuse to ratify within a specified reasonable period. The root legal conclusion is: "If the principal fails to give a definite answer within that period, the principal is deemed to have refused to ratify."

- **Root Node (R1):** Principal is deemed to have refused to ratify if no response is given within the specified period.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors here include:
- The demand by the counterparty for a definite answer within a reasonable period.
- The failure of the principal to provide a definitive answer within that period.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Demand for ratification by the counterparty within a reasonable time frame.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Principal's response or lack thereof to the demand for ratification.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1 and A2:
- For A1, a base-level factor could be the specification of the time period being reasonable.
- For A2, a base-level factor could be the principal's failure to respond at all.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The specified period for response is deemed reasonable.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Principal does not provide any answer within the given timeframe.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

- **(B1 supports A1):** Because if the time frame is reasonable, it supports the legitimacy of the counterparty's demand for a timely decision.
- **(B2 supports A2):** As the principal's lack of response directly relates to their failure to provide a definitive answer.
- **(A1 supports R1):** Since the demand for a timely decision is a premise for deeming the principal's non-response as refusal.
- **(A2 denies R1 if interpreted differently, but based on the article, it should support):** Correctly understood, A2 (Principal's failure to respond) supports R1 (deemed refusal), as the article implies that lack of response leads to deemed refusal.

### Query Analysis

Given query: "The counterparty of an act of unauthorized agency can determine a reasonable period of time for the principal and demand to ratify or not to ratify during that period, and if the principal does not provide a definite answer within the time period, the principal is deemed to have ratified."

- **(Query entails B1):** Because it mentions determining a "reasonable period of time," aligning with B1.
- **(Query disagrees R1):** The query states the principal is deemed to have ratified if no response is given, contrary to R1 which states the principal is deemed to have refused.

Therefore, after careful consideration and justification:
- **(Query entails B1)**
- **(Query disagree R1)**

This indicates that while the query aligns with the base-level factor regarding the reasonableness of the time period, it fundamentally disagrees with the root legal conclusion regarding the outcome of the principal's non-response.

correct prediction case 133
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and to address the query, let's break down the information step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article seeks to establish the relationship between a subagent, an agent, and a principal. Specifically, it concludes that a subagent represents the principal with respect to acts within the scope of their authority and has the same rights and obligations as an agent towards the principal and third parties.

- **Root Node (R1):** A subagent's actions are considered acts of agency for the principal within the scope of their authority.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

To validate or invalidate R1, we consider:
- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The legal authority of a subagent to act on behalf of the principal.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The scope of authority granted to the subagent by the agent.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining A1 and A2:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1:** The subagent's actions are legally binding for the principal when within their authorized scope.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) under A2:** The specific limits of authority granted to the subagent by the agent.

### 4. Establish Directed Links

- **(A1 supports R1):** Because if a subagent has legal authority, their actions can be considered acts of agency for the principal.
- **(A2 supports R1):** Since the scope of authority defines what acts are considered within the bounds of agency for the principal.
- **(B1 supports A1):** As it specifies under what conditions a subagent's actions are legally binding for the principal.
- **(B2 supports A2):** By detailing the specific limits of that authority.

### Query Analysis

Given the query: "In cases where a privately appointed agent appoints a subagent due to unavoidable reasons, the sub-agent only possesses a legal relationship with the agent, so acts of the subagent are not acts of agency for the principal."

- **(query entails B1):** The scenario described involves a consideration of the subagent's authority and its implications on their actions being legally binding for the principal, which aligns with the conditions under which a subagent's actions are considered acts of agency (or not).

### Agreement or Disagreement with Root Node

- **(query disagree R1):** The query suggests that in certain circumstances (when a privately appointed agent appoints a subagent due to unavoidable reasons), the subagent's actions may not be considered acts of agency for the principal, which contradicts the root node's assertion that a subagent's actions within their scope of authority are considered acts of agency for the principal.

### Rejustification

Upon reevaluation, considering the context and specifics provided by both the article and the query:
- The query does indeed present a scenario that could be seen as entailing **B1**, because it discusses the conditions under which a subagent's actions might or might not be considered acts of agency for the principal.
- However, the critical point is whether this scenario aligns with or contradicts **R1**. Given that **R1** posits that a subagent's actions within their authority are acts of agency for the principal, and the query presents a situation where it suggests they might not be (due to the nature of the appointment), there is indeed a disagreement.

Thus, after careful consideration and rejustification:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

These conclusions are based on the understanding that the query presents a specific scenario that challenges the general principle outlined in **R1**, by suggesting conditions under which a subagent's actions may not be considered direct acts of agency for the principal.

correct prediction case 134
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that an act performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as an agent of another person may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: An act by a qualified legal capacity individual as an agent cannot be rescinded due to qualified legal capacity issues.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The legal capacity of the agent.
- **A2**: The role of the agent (whether as a legal representative or another form of agent).

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- **B1**: The agent is a minor.
- **B2**: The act was performed under private appointment rather than legal representation.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Because having qualified legal capacity as an agent generally supports the notion that acts cannot be rescinded due to capacity issues.
- **(A2 denies R1 in cases of legal representation)**: Since the article specifies that acts performed by a person with qualified legal capacity as a legal representative of another can indeed be subject to different rules, potentially allowing for rescission.
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Being a minor could affect one's legal capacity, but in this context, it specifically relates to acting as an agent.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Acts performed under private appointment (as opposed to legal representation) fall under the scenarios where rescission due to qualified legal capacity is not applicable.

### Justification
Given the query "A privately appointed agent can be a minor, but acts of agency by a minor can be rescinded by the statutory agent," let's analyze:
- The query discusses a scenario involving a minor acting as an agent under private appointment. This directly relates to **B1** and **B2**, which concern being a minor and acting under private appointment, respectively.
- Therefore, **(query entails B1)** because it considers a situation where the agent is a minor.
- Additionally, **(query entails B2)** since it mentions private appointment.

### Agreement with Root Node
The query seems to suggest that even though a privately appointed agent can be a minor, there are conditions under which acts by a minor can be rescinded (by the statutory agent). This nuanced view does not directly contradict **R1** but rather adds specificity regarding the role of statutory agents in cases involving minors. However, it implies there might be exceptions or additional considerations not fully encapsulated by **R1** alone.
- Given this nuance and focusing strictly on whether acts can be rescinded due to qualified legal capacity when performed under private appointment (without delving into the specifics of statutory agent intervention), one could argue that the query does not directly disagree with **R1** but rather provides additional context. 
- Thus, **(query agree R1)** in the sense that it doesn't outright contradict the premise regarding acts by agents with qualified legal capacity under private appointment but adds complexity regarding minors and statutory agents.

### Rejustification
Upon further consideration, the key aspect of the query is its introduction of a condition (acts by a minor can be rescinded by the statutory agent) that wasn't directly addressed in the initial construction of **R1**. This suggests that while **R1** establishes a general principle, there are specific scenarios (like those involving minors and statutory agents) where additional rules apply.
- The query's focus on minors and the role of statutory agents introduces a layer of complexity not fully captured by the initial **R1** formulation.
- However, given the structure and links established, the query does indeed relate to **B1** and **B2**, supporting the conclusion that **(query entails B1)** and **(query entails B2)**.
- The agreement with **R1** is nuanced, as the query provides additional context rather than a direct contradiction. Therefore, the justification that **(query agree R1)** holds when considering the query's alignment with the general principle outlined in **R1**, albeit with the understanding that there are specific conditions and exceptions.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article seeks to establish that if the counterparty to a voidable act is identified, the voidance or ratification of that act is made by the manifestation of intention to the counterparty. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** Voidance or ratification of a voidable act must be made by manifesting intention to the identified counterparty.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1:** The existence of a voidable act.
- **A2:** The identification of the counterparty to the voidable act.
- **A3:** The requirement for manifestation of intention for voidance or ratification.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1:** The act was performed without the necessary consent (e.g., by a minor without their statutory agent's consent).
- Under **A2**:
  - **B2:** The counterparty is aware of the voidable nature of the act.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B3:** The manifestation of intention must be explicit and communicated directly to the counterparty.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Directed links include:
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Because an act performed without necessary consent is a classic example of a voidable act.
- **(B2 supports A2)**: Since awareness of the counterparty about the nature of the act can influence how the manifestation of intention is made.
- **(B3 supports A3)**: As explicit communication to the counterparty is essential for effective manifestation of intention.

Given these definitions and links:
- The query "In cases where a minor rescinds a juridical act performed without the consent of his or her statutory agent, if the counterparty of the act has been identified, the rescission is made by the manifestation of intention to the counterparty" **entails B1** because it considers a scenario where an act was performed without necessary consent (by a minor without their statutory agent's consent).
- This query **agrees with R1** because both the query and R1 conclude that in similar situations (involving identified counterparties and voidable acts), the manifestation of intention to rescind or ratify must be made to the counterparty.

Thus, after careful consideration:
- The output is: **(query entails B1)** and **(query agrees R1)**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and query, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that if a counterparty to a voidable act is identified, the voidance or ratification of that act is made by the manifestation of intention to the counterparty. Therefore, the root node can be determined as:
- R1: Voidance or ratification of a voidable act must be communicated to the identified counterparty.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- A1: The identification of the counterparty.
- A2: The manifestation of intention regarding the voidable act.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For A1 and A2, we can refine them further:
- B1 (under A1): The counterparty is directly involved in the voidable act.
- B2 (under A1): The third party is affected by the performance promised in the contract but is not the counterparty.
- B3 (under A2): Manifestation of intention to rescind due to fraud must be made to the counterparty or, under specific conditions, to a third party.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (B1 supports A1) because direct involvement justifies communication to the counterparty.
- (B2 supports A1) as it considers scenarios involving third parties affected by the contract.
- (B3 supports A2) since manifestation of intention is crucial for voidance or ratification, with considerations for communication to third parties under specific conditions.
- (A1 supports R1) because identifying the counterparty is essential for determining who should receive the manifestation of intention.
- (A2 supports R1) as it outlines the action required for voidance or ratification.

Given the query: "If a person promises in a contract that he or she will tender a certain performance to a third party other than the counterparty, in cases where this is rescinded due to fraud of the counterparty, if manifestation of intention of profit is already made by the third party, the rescission is made by the manifestation of intention to the third party."

### Justification
- The query entails B3 because it considers a scenario where the manifestation of intention (regarding profit) has been made to a third party due to the counterparty's fraud, aligning with the refined base-level factor concerning specific conditions for communication.
- The query disagrees with R1 in the context provided. R1 states that voidance or ratification should be communicated to the identified counterparty, while the query suggests that under certain conditions (fraud by the counterparty and prior manifestation of intention to a third party), rescission is appropriately made by manifesting intention to the third party, not directly following R1's general principle.

Therefore, the output is:
- (query entails B3)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 424 seeks to establish that an obligee may demand the court to rescind an act which the obligor commits knowing it will prejudice the obligee, under certain conditions.

- **Root Node (R1):** The court may rescind an act by the obligor that prejudices the obligee.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- Knowledge of the obligor about the prejudice to the obligee.
- The beneficiary's knowledge at the time of the act.
- The nature of the act (whether it involves property rights).
- The enforceability of the obligee's claim.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** The obligor knew that their act would prejudice the obligee.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The beneficiary did not know about the prejudice at the time of the act.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** The act involves property rights.
- **Abstract Factor (A4):** The obligee's claim is enforceable by compulsory execution.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For refinement, consider specific conditions:
- For A1, a base-level factor could be the existence of evidence proving the obligor's knowledge.
- For A2, a condition could be the beneficiary's statement or actions indicating lack of knowledge.
- For A3, a condition is that the act directly affects property rights (e.g., sale, transfer).
- For A4, the condition is that the claim meets legal requirements for compulsory execution.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** There is evidence proving the obligor knew their act would prejudice the obligee.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** The beneficiary explicitly states they did not know about the potential prejudice.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3):** The act directly involves the transfer of property rights.
- **Base-Level Factor (B4):** The obligee's claim meets all legal requirements for compulsory execution.

### 4. Establish Directed Links
Each abstract factor supports or denies the root node, and each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor.

- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**
- **(A4 supports R1)**
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**
- **(B3 supports A3)**
- **(B4 supports A4)**

### Justification of Query Entailment and Agreement with Root
Given the query: "The rescission of a fraudulent act is performed by the court based on the demand of the obligee."

- The query directly relates to the conditions under which an act can be rescinded, which involves base-level factors such as the existence of evidence (B1), the nature of the act (B3), and the enforceability of the claim (B4).
- **(query entails B1)** because both consider scenarios where evidence of the obligor's knowledge is crucial.
- **(query entails B3)** since the rescission pertains to acts involving property rights, which is a specific scenario covered by this base-level factor.
- **(query entails B4)** as the query implies the claim must be enforceable for the court to act on the demand.

Considering the root node (R1), the query essentially agrees with it because both are about the conditions under which the court may rescind an act prejudicial to the obligee. Thus, **(query agree R1)**.

After re-justification, considering the specifics of the legal provisions and the structure constructed, the conclusion remains that the query entails certain base-level factors (B1, B3, B4) and agrees with the root node (R1), as it aligns with the conditions for rescinding a fraudulent act based on the obligee's demand.

wrong prediction case 138
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R):**
   - The article seeks to establish that a person who commences the possession of movables peacefully and openly by a transactional act acquires the rights immediately if the person possesses it in good faith and without negligence.
   - **Root Node (R1):** A person acquires immediate rights to movables possessed in good faith and without negligence.

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A):**
   - Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion include:
     - **Abstract Factor (A1):** Possession commenced peacefully and openly.
     - **Abstract Factor (A2):** Possession is in good faith.
     - **Abstract Factor (A3):** Possession is without negligence.

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:**
   - For A1, a base-level factor could be:
     - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** The possession began through a transactional act.
   - For A2 and A3, no further refinement is provided in the problem statement.

4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):**
   - **(B1 supports A1)**: Starting possession through a transactional act supports the notion that it was commenced peacefully and openly.
   - **(A1 supports R1)**: Peaceful and open commencement of possession supports immediate acquisition of rights.
   - **(A2 supports R1)**: Good faith possession supports immediate acquisition of rights.
   - **(A3 supports R1)**: Possession without negligence supports immediate acquisition of rights.

Given the query, "Provisions for immediate acquisition do not apply in cases where the property of an inheritee that possessed another person's movables is succeeded by inheritance," let's analyze:

- The query introduces a scenario involving inheritance and possession of another person's movables, which seems to deviate from the direct conditions under which immediate acquisition applies as per the article.
- This scenario does not directly match any of the base-level factors (like B1) but rather suggests a condition under which immediate acquisition might not apply.

Considering the query in relation to the constructed structure:
- The query does not directly support or deny any abstract factor without additional context. However, it implies a situation that could potentially deny the applicability of R1 under specific conditions (inheritance).
- Given this, **(query entails B1 is not applicable)** because B1 specifically talks about possession starting through a transactional act, which does not directly relate to inheritance scenarios.
- The query seems to introduce a new condition not covered by the base-level factors provided. However, if we consider its implications on the root node:
  - **(query disagree R1)**: In the context of inheritance succeeding another person's movables, the provisions for immediate acquisition do not apply, suggesting disagreement with the straightforward application of R1 under all circumstances.

Upon re-justification, considering the nuances and focusing strictly on the provided structure and query:
- The introduction of an inheritance scenario complicates direct comparison to the base-level factors without additional context.
- However, the core idea is that certain conditions (like those involving inheritance) might not align with the straightforward application of immediate rights acquisition as stated in R1.

Therefore, the justification stands that the query does indeed introduce a scenario that could lead to disagreement with the unconditional application of R1 under all circumstances, especially considering scenarios not explicitly covered by the base-level factors provided.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. In this case, it's about acquiring ownership of movables through immediate acquisition when possessing them in good faith and without negligence.

- **Root Node (R1):** A person acquires the rights to movables immediately if they possess them peacefully, openly, by a transactional act, in good faith, and without negligence.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These are key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion of immediate acquisition of movables.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Good faith of the person acquiring the movables.
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** The absence of negligence on the part of the person acquiring the movables.
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Peaceful and open possession by a transactional act.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
We refine abstract factors into more specific conditions that directly apply to particular scenarios.

- **Base-Level Factor (B1) under A1:** The person believes they have the right to acquire the movables.
- **Base-Level Factor (B2) under A2:** No knowledge or reasonable suspicion of defects in the transfer process.
- **Base-Level Factor (B3) under A3:** The transactional act is legally recognized and performed in accordance with legal requirements.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each factor must support or deny another factor or the root node. Note that abstract factors do not point to base-level factors directly, but through their supporting relationships.

- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A2)**
- **(B3 supports A3)**
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**

### Evaluating the Query
The query states: "If a person accepts the transfer of movables owned by the counterparty, who is incapable of intention, and the person is in good faith and without fault regarding the incapability of intention of the counterparty, he or she acquires the ownership of the movable due to immediate acquisition."

- **Query Entails Base-Level Factor:** The query entails a scenario where the person is in good faith (similar to B1) because they are unaware of the counterparty's incapability of intention. Thus, **(query entails B1)**.
  
- **Agreement with Root Node:** Given that the query involves good faith and an open transaction (implied by acceptance of transfer), it aligns with the conditions for immediate acquisition outlined in R1. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After rejustification, considering the specifics of the ANGELIC structure and the details provided in the query, the initial assessment stands as correct based on the information given and the logical framework established. 

**Output:**
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

wrong prediction case 140
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The outcome of Article 239 seeks to establish that ownership of movables without an owner is acquired by possessing the same with the intention to own. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1:** Possession of a movable without an owner with the intention to own results in the acquisition of ownership.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1:** The movable is indeed without an owner.
- **A2:** The possession is done with the intention to own.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining A1 and A2, we get:
- **B1:** The movable was previously abandoned or never owned.
- **B2:** The possessor has a clear intent to use and manage the movable as their own.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
- **(B1 supports A1):** If a movable is previously abandoned or never owned, it supports the factor that the movable is indeed without an owner.
- **(B2 supports A2):** If the possessor has a clear intent to use and manage the movable as their own, it supports the possession being done with the intention to own.
- **(A1 supports R1):** The fact that the movable is without an owner supports the conclusion that possession with the intention to own results in ownership acquisition.
- **(A2 supports R1):** The intention to own during possession supports the conclusion that such possession leads to ownership acquisition.

Given the query: "By possessing a movable without an owner with the intention to own, the possessor acquires ownership of the movable."

### Justification:
- **(query entails B1 and B2):** The query implies a scenario where the movable is without an owner (supporting B1) and the possession is done with the intention to own (supporting B2).
- **(query agree R1):** The query directly agrees with the root node R1, as it states that possessing a movable without an owner with the intention to own results in the acquisition of ownership.

Rejustifying:
The agreement between the query and R1 is direct because both assert the same legal outcome given similar conditions (possession of a movable without an owner with the intent to own). The query entails base-level factors B1 and B2 by implying the necessary conditions for the scenario described in R1. Therefore, the justified conclusion remains consistent.

Output:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 197 and Article 200 seeks to establish that a possessor who is forcibly dispossessed may demand the restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage by filing an action for recovery of possession. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A possessor who is forcibly dispossessed can demand restitution and compensation through an action for recovery of possession.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The possession was taken forcibly.
- **A2**: The intention behind the original possession (to own or not to own).
- **A3**: The knowledge of the successor about the unlawful taking of possession.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2** into base-level factors:
- **B1**: The possession was taken without the consent of the possessor.
- **B2**: The original possession was with the intention to own.
- **B3**: The original possession was without the intention to own.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**: Forcible dispossession implies a lack of consent.
- **(B2 supports A2)** and **(B3 supports A2)**: Both scenarios of original possession intent support the consideration of intention behind the possession.
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Forcible taking directly supports the right to demand restitution.
- **(A2 denies R1)**: The intention behind the original possession could potentially undermine the claim if it affects the legal status of the possession.
- **(A3 denies R1)**: If a successor had knowledge of the unlawful taking, it could affect their liability.

Given the query: "If the possession of an item is forcibly dispossessed by the possessor, even in cases where the possession before the dispossession was performed with the intention to own, and in cases without intention to own, the possessor can demand the return of the item based on action for the recovery of possession."

### Justification
- **(query entails B1)**: The query mentions forcible dispossession, which aligns with B1.
- **(query entails B2 and B3)**: The query covers both scenarios of original possession intent (with and without intention to own), which aligns with both B2 and B3.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query concludes that the possessor can demand the return of the item, which agrees with the root node R1 that a forcibly dispossessed possessor can demand restitution.

After rejustification, considering the structure and the query's alignment with the base-level factors and the root node, the conclusion remains consistent.

wrong prediction case 142
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break it down step by step:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R):
The article seeks to establish that a possessor is presumed to possess a thing with the intention to own, in good faith peacefully and openly. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- R1: A possessor is presumed to possess a thing with the intention to own, in good faith, peacefully, and openly.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A):
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- A1: Possession with the intention to own.
- A2: Good faith possession.
- A3: Peaceful possession.
- A4: Open possession.

These abstract factors validate the root node's conclusion regarding the presumption of a possessor's intentions and manner of possession.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
For refining, let's consider "Possession with the intention to own" and other factors:
- B1: Evidence of ownership documents supports A1.
- B2: Continuous possession over time supports A1.
- B3: Lack of dispute from others supports A2 (Good faith).
- B4: No history of conflict supports A3 (Peaceful possession).
- B5: Visible and acknowledged possession by the community supports A4 (Open possession).

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny):
Directed links include:
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A1)
- (B3 supports A2)
- (B4 supports A3)
- (B5 supports A4)

Each of these base-level factors directly supports its respective abstract factor, which in turn supports the root node's conclusion.

Given the query: "A possessor is presumed to possess in good faith, peacefully, and in public, but is not presumed to have intention to own."

### Justification:
- The query entails B3 (Good faith), B4 (Peaceful possession), and potentially a factor similar to B5 (Open possession) since it mentions "in public."
- However, the query directly disagrees with the root node R1 because it states that there is no presumption of intention to own, which contradicts the core part of R1.

Therefore, considering the structure and the query:
- (query entails B3)
- (query entails B4)
- Since "in public" could be considered similar to open possession, we might also say: (query entails a factor similar to B5)
- Most importantly, regarding the root node's verdict on intention to own: (query disagree R1)

After re-justification, these conclusions remain consistent with the analysis provided.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node (R) is determined by the outcome of the article, which seeks to establish that if it is assumed a possessor does not have the intention to own due to the nature of the title, the nature of their possession changes only when they manifest an intention to own or commence possession under a new title with such intention.

- **R1**: The nature of a possessor's possession changes with an expressed intention to own or a new title.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion are:
- **A1**: Assumption of no intention to own due to the title's nature.
- **A2**: Manifestation of intention to own by the possessor.
- **A3**: Commencement of possession under a new title with an intention to own.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A2** and **A3**:
- **B1**: The possessor explicitly states their intention to own the property.
- **B2**: The possessor commences possession under a new title with an expressed intention to own from that time.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A2)**: Explicitly stating an intention to own directly supports the manifestation of such intention.
- **(B2 supports A3)**: Commencing possession under a new title with an expressed intention to own supports the factor of starting possession under a new title with an intention to own.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Manifesting an intention to own supports the conclusion that the nature of possession changes.
- **(A3 supports R1)**: Commencing possession under a new title with an intention to own also supports the change in the nature of possession.

### Analysis of Query
Given query: "In cases where it is assumed, due to the nature of the title, that a possessor does not have the intention to own, if the possessor commences possession under a new title with an intention to own from that time, the nature of the possessor's possession changes with the intention to own."

- **(query entails B2)**: The query directly considers a scenario where possession commences under a new title with an intention to own, aligning with base-level factor **B2**.
  
- To determine if the query agrees or disagrees with **R1**, we analyze the query's outcome in relation to **R1**'s conclusion:
  - The query concludes that the nature of possession changes when a possessor commences possession under a new title with an intention to own. This directly aligns with **R1**, which states that the nature of a possessor's possession changes with an expressed intention to own or under a new title.
  
- **(query agree R1)**: The query and **R1** present the same verdict in comparable situations, as both conclude that the nature of possession can change based on the possessor's actions regarding their intention to own.

After careful reconsideration:
The initial analysis correctly identifies that the query entails a base-level factor (**B2**) and agrees with the root node (**R1**) on the conclusion that the nature of a possessor's possession changes under specific conditions related to their intention to own. This agreement is based on the shared scenario where commencing possession under a new title with an intention to own leads to a change in the nature of possession, which aligns with both the query and **R1**.

Thus, the output format reflecting this analysis is:
- (query entails B2)
- (query agree R1)

correct prediction case 144
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that when a possessor returns a thing in their possession, they may have the person recovering the thing reimburse them for certain costs and expenses under specific conditions.

- **Root Node (R1):** A possessor can be reimbursed by the person recovering the thing for costs and expenses related to its preservation or improvement.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that validate or invalidate this conclusion include:
- The nature of the possessor's faith (good or bad).
- The type of expenses incurred (preservation, improvement).
- The acquisition of fruits by the possessor.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Possessor's Faith
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Type of Expenses Incurred
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Acquisition of Fruits

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable:
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1 (Possessor's Faith)**, a base-level factor could be the distinction between possessors in good faith and those in bad faith.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Possessor in Good Faith
  - **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Possessor in Bad Faith
- Under **A2 (Type of Expenses Incurred)**, we distinguish between expenses for preservation and those for improvement.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B3):** Expenses for Preservation
  - **Base-Level Factor (B4):** Expenses for Improvement
- Under **A3 (Acquisition of Fruits)**, a relevant factor is whether the possessor has acquired fruits from the thing in their possession.
  - **Base-Level Factor (B5):** Acquisition of Fruits by Possessor

### 4. Establish Directed Links:
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 denies A1)**, as a bad faith possessor may face different treatment regarding reimbursement.
- **(B3 supports A2)**
- **(B4 supports A2)**
- **(B5 supports A3)**
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 denies R1)**, in the sense that if fruits are acquired, certain expenses (ordinary and necessary) are borne by the possessor.

### Justification of Query Entailment:
Given the query "When the possessor acquires fruits from a thing under his or her possession, ordinary necessary expenses shall be borne by the possessor," we see this directly aligns with **Base-Level Factor (B5)** and its implications on reimbursement.

- **(query entails B5)**
This is because both the query and B5 consider the scenario where a possessor acquires fruits from the thing in their possession, leading to the conclusion that certain expenses are borne by the possessor.

### Justification of Agreement with Root:
The root node (R1) deals with the conditions under which a possessor can be reimbursed for costs related to the preservation or improvement of a thing. The query specifically discusses a scenario where the possessor acquires fruits, leading to the conclusion that they bear certain expenses themselves.

- **(query disagree R1)**
This is because while R1 generally supports reimbursement for various expenses under specific conditions, the query highlights a particular condition (acquisition of fruits) under which the possessor does not receive reimbursement for ordinary and necessary expenses but instead bears them.

### Rejustification:
Upon further consideration, it's clear that the initial interpretation correctly identifies the relationship between the query and B5 as well as its disagreement with R1 in the context provided. The distinction lies in understanding the specific conditions under which reimbursement is granted or denied, with the acquisition of fruits introducing a scenario where certain expenses are not reimbursable to the possessor.

Thus, reaffirming:
- **(query entails B5)**
- **(query disagree R1)**

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)

The article seeks to establish that if a holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the thing retained, that holder may have the owner reimburse the same. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A holder of a right of retention can have the owner reimburse necessary expenses incurred.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)

The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The incurrence of necessary expenses by the holder.
- **A2**: The existence of a right of retention held by the person incurring the expenses.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining **A1** and **A2** into base-level factors:
- Under **A1**, we can have:
  - **B1**: The expenses incurred are directly related to the preservation or maintenance of the thing retained.
- Under **A2**, we can have:
  - **B2**: The holder has a legally recognized right of retention over the thing.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)

Directed links:
- (**B1** supports **A1**): Expenses directly related to preservation support the notion of necessary expenses.
- (**B2** supports **A2**): A legally recognized right of retention supports the holder's claim.
- (**A1** supports **R1**): Necessary expenses incurred justify reimbursement.
- (**A2** supports **R1**): The existence of a right of retention justifies the claim for reimbursement.

Given the query: "If a holder of a right of retention incurs necessary expenses with respect to the Thing related, he or she can have the owner reimburse the same. C. A mandatary can demand the mandator the day after the completion of the mandate for reimbursement of fees paid that were recognized as necessary expenses for the administration of the mandated business."

### Justification

- The query entails **B1** because it discusses necessary expenses incurred by a holder of a right of retention, similar to what **B1** outlines.
- The query agrees with **R1** because both assert that a holder of a right of retention can have necessary expenses reimbursed by the owner.

Therefore:
- (query entails **B1**)
- (query agree **R1**)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this structure, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)

The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 665 and related provisions, a primary conclusion can be derived as follows:

- **R1**: The depositary is entitled to demand performance of obligations from the depositor for the retention of a deposited thing.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)

These are key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the root legal conclusion. From the articles provided, we can identify the following abstract factors:

- **A1**: The necessity of expenditures or obligations for the administration of the mandated business.
- **A2**: The mandatary's right to reimbursement and compensation for necessary costs and damages incurred.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable

Refining abstract factors into more specific scenarios:

- **B1** (supports A1): If borne obligations are deemed necessary for the retention of a deposited thing.
- **B2** (supports A2): The mandatary's entitlement to demand performance of obligations from the mandator when such obligations are necessary.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links

Each abstract factor and base-level factor must have a directed link either supporting or denying another factor. For simplicity, we establish:

- **B1 supports A1**
- **A1 supports R1** (because if the expenditures/obligations are necessary for the administration of the mandated business, it supports the depositary's entitlement to demand performance)
- **B2 supports A2**
- **A2 supports R1** (as it outlines the mandatary's rights in relation to the mandator)

### Evaluating the Query

Given query: "If borne obligations are deemed to be necessary for the retention of a deposited thing, the depositary can demand that the depositor perform the obligation on the depositary's behalf. In such cases, if the obligation has not yet fallen due, the depositary can require the depositor to tender reasonable security."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query directly refers to a situation where obligations are necessary for the retention of a deposited thing, aligning with base-level factor B1.
  
### Agreement with Root Node

Given that the query entails B1 and considering the structure:

- **(query agree R1)**: Since the query outlines a scenario (borne obligations being necessary) that supports the depositary's entitlement to demand performance from the depositor, it aligns with the root node R1. Both the query and R1 conclude in favor of the depositary's rights under similar circumstances.

Upon re-evaluation, this conclusion remains consistent because both the query and the constructed ANGELIC structure support the depositary's right to demand obligation performance from the depositor when such obligations are deemed necessary for the retention of a deposited thing. 

Therefore, the final output is:
- (query entails B1)
- (query agree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's break down the process step by step.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 702 seeks to establish that a manager may claim reimbursement of beneficial expenses from the principal under certain conditions. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: A manager may claim reimbursement for beneficial expenses incurred on behalf of the principal.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The manager has incurred beneficial expenses for the principal.
- **A2**: The manager's actions were within the scope of their authority or against the will of the principal but resulted in beneficial outcomes.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining **A1** and **A2**:
- **B1**: The expenses incurred by the manager are directly beneficial to the principal.
- **B2**: The manager's actions, although against the principal's intention, resulted in enrichment for the principal.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (**B1 supports A1**): Directly beneficial expenses support the claim for reimbursement.
- (**B2 supports A2**): Actions resulting in enrichment for the principal, even if against their will, support the consideration for reimbursement under certain conditions.
- (**A1 supports R1**): The existence of beneficial expenses supports the manager's claim for reimbursement.
- (**A2 supports R1**): The scenario where actions against the principal's will lead to beneficial outcomes also supports the possibility of reimbursement.

Given the query: "Even in cases where the manager in management of business has engaged in the management of business against the intention of the principal, if the manager has incurred useful expenses for the principal, the manager may claim reimbursement of all costs from the principal."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query mentions "useful expenses," which aligns with beneficial expenses being directly beneficial to the principal.
- **(query agree R1)**: The query agrees that the manager may claim reimbursement for beneficial expenses, even in scenarios where actions were taken against the principal's intention, underlining a scenario similar to what **R1** concludes.

Upon rejustification, considering the structure and the query:
- The query indeed focuses on a situation where the manager incurs useful (beneficial) expenses, which is directly related to **B1**.
- The core of the query aligns with the root node **R1**, emphasizing the reimbursement for beneficial expenses under specific conditions, including actions against the principal's will but resulting in benefits.

Therefore, the final assessment remains:
- **(query entails B1)**
- **(query agree R1)**

wrong prediction case 148
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we'll follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 295 and Article 533 can be summarized into two root nodes:
- R1: A possessor of a thing belonging to another person may retain that thing until their claim is satisfied.
- R2: A party to a bilateral contract may refuse to perform their obligation until the other party tenders their performance.

These root nodes establish the legal conclusions regarding rights of retention and defense of simultaneous performance, respectively.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
For R1:
- A1: The possessor has a valid claim that has arisen in relation to the thing.
- A2: The possession did not commence by means of a tortious act.

For R2:
- A3: The obligation of the other party is due.
- A4: The refusal to perform is based on the defense of simultaneous performance.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For A1:
- B1: The claim is directly related to the thing being retained.
- B2: The claim has fallen due.

For A3:
- B3: The obligation's due date has been clearly established.
- B4: The other party's performance is a prerequisite for the refusing party's action.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (B1 supports A1)
- (B2 supports A1)
- (A1 supports R1)
- (A2 supports R1)
- (B3 supports A3)
- (B4 supports A4)
- (A3 supports R2)
- (A4 supports R2)

### Justification
Given the query: "The contents of performance that can be refused based on rights of retention are the delivery of the thing, but the contents of performance that can be refused based on rights of defense of simultaneous performance are not limited to the delivery of the thing."

This query considers scenarios similar to those described by Base-Level Factors B1 and B4, as it discusses the specific conditions under which a party may refuse performance, comparing rights of retention (related to R1) with rights of defense of simultaneous performance (related to R2).

- (query entails B1): The query mentions the delivery of the thing in the context of rights of retention, aligning with B1's focus on claims directly related to the retained thing.
- (query entails B4): By noting that contents of performance under defense of simultaneous performance are not limited to the delivery of a thing, it touches upon the idea that performance prerequisites can vary, supporting the essence of B4.

Comparing the query with R2, since it discusses the specifics of when and how performance can be refused in bilateral contracts:
- (query agree R2): The query essentially agrees with the principle established by R2, which allows a party to refuse their obligation until the other party performs, especially highlighting that this refusal is not limited to just the delivery of things.

Upon reevaluation:
The initial assessment correctly identifies the alignment between the query and certain base-level factors, as well as its agreement with one of the root nodes. The query's discussion on the specifics of performance refusal under different legal principles directly relates to both B1 and B4, showing how it entails these base-level factors by considering similar scenarios. Furthermore, the query aligns with R2 by acknowledging the principle of refusing performance until the other party has performed their obligation, demonstrating an understanding that this concept is not limited to a specific type of performance like the delivery of a thing.

Therefore, the conclusion stands:
- (query entails B1)
- (query entails B4)
- (query agree R2)

correct prediction case 149
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To address the given task, let's break down the process step by step according to the provided instructions and legal provisions.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of the articles provided seeks to establish rules regarding rights of retention and defense for simultaneous performance in contractual obligations. Therefore, a possible root node could be:
- R1: A party can demand termination of a right of retention or defense by providing reasonable security under specific conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that either substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
- A1: The existence of a contractual obligation between parties.
- A2: The applicability of rights of retention or defense for simultaneous performance.
- A3: The provision of reasonable security as a condition to demand termination of such rights.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors:
- B1 (under A2): The right of retention can be terminated by providing reasonable security.
- B2 (under A2): Rights of defense for simultaneous performance cannot be terminated by simply tendering reasonable security.
- B3 (under A3): The nature and sufficiency of "reasonable security" in terminating rights of retention or defense.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (B1 supports A2)
- (B2 denies A2)
- (A2 supports R1)
- (A3 supports R1)

Given the query:
"A person who is being exercised rights of retention can demand that the right be extinguished by tendering reasonable security, but a person who is being exercised rights of defense for simultaneous performance cannot demand that the right be extinguished by tendering reasonable security."

### Justification
- (query entails B1) because it mentions that a right of retention can be terminated by providing reasonable security.
- (query entails B2) since it also states that rights of defense for simultaneous performance cannot be so terminated.

Comparing the query with the root node R1:
- The query seems to partially agree and partially disagree with the general statement of R1, as it specifies conditions under which termination can or cannot be demanded. However, focusing on the aspect of demanding termination by providing reasonable security, we see that the query aligns with the principle that such demands are possible under specific circumstances (for rights of retention) but not others (for defense of simultaneous performance).

Therefore, considering the nuances and focusing on the agreement regarding the possibility of demanding termination of a right of retention by providing reasonable security:
- (query agree R1), insofar as it acknowledges the possibility of terminating certain rights by providing reasonable security, though it also introduces distinctions based on the type of right.

After careful reconsideration, this analysis stands as it reflects the query's alignment with specific conditions under which rights can be terminated by offering security, while also highlighting the distinction between types of rights (retention vs. defense for simultaneous performance).

wrong prediction case 150
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Root Node (R)**:
   - The article seeks to establish that the creation of a pledge over a claim may not be duly asserted against a third party obligor unless notice is given or consent obtained.
   - **Root Node (R1)**: "A pledge over a claim cannot be asserted against a third party obligor without proper notice or consent."

2. **Derive Abstract Factors (A)**:
   - Key legal factors include the requirement for notice to be given to the third party obligor and the necessity of consent from the third party obligor.
   - **Abstract Factor (A1)**: "Proper Notice Given"
   - **Abstract Factor (A2)**: "Consent Obtained"

3. **Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable**:
   - For pledges over nominative claims with an instrument, the pledge establishment requires the delivery of the instrument.
   - **Base-Level Factor (B1)**: "Instrument Delivered for Nominative Claims"
   
4. **Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)**:
   - **(A1 supports R1)**: Giving proper notice to the third party obligor supports the assertion of a pledge over a claim.
   - **(A2 supports R1)**: Obtaining consent from the third party obligor supports the assertion of a pledge over a claim.
   - **(B1 supports A1)**: Delivering the instrument for nominative claims is a specific condition that supports the proper notice requirement.

Given the ANGELIC structure, let's analyze the query:
- The query mentions "pledges over nominative claims" and states that if there is an instrument for the claim, the pledge establishment does not take effect unless the instrument is delivered.
- **(query entails B1)**: The query directly relates to the scenario where the delivery of the instrument is necessary for the pledge establishment to take effect over nominative claims.

Now, comparing the query with the Root Node (R1):
- Both the query and R1 discuss conditions under which a pledge can be effectively established or asserted against third parties.
- However, R1 focuses on the general requirements of notice or consent, while the query specifies a condition for pledges over nominative claims with an instrument.
- The essence of both is about what makes a pledge enforceable or recognized by third parties; hence, they are discussing aspects of the same legal principle regarding the establishment and assertion of pledges.

Therefore, considering the comparable situation:
- **(query agree R1)**: The query agrees with R1 in that it specifies a particular scenario (nominative claims with an instrument) where a specific condition (delivery of the instrument) must be met for the pledge to be recognized, aligning with the principle that certain conditions (like notice or consent) are necessary for asserting pledges against third parties.

After careful reconsideration:
- The agreement between the query and R1 holds because both emphasize the importance of fulfilling specific conditions for a pledge to be effectively established or asserted.

wrong prediction case 151
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then assess the given query against this framework, we'll follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node is determined by identifying the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish. Based on Article 366, the primary conclusion can be stated as:
- **R1**: A pledgee has the right to directly collect a pledged claim under certain conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Abstract factors are key legal principles or conditions that validate or invalidate the root conclusion. From Article 366, we can derive the following abstract factors:
- **A1**: The nature of the subject matter of the pledge (monies vs. non-monies).
- **A2**: The timing of the due dates for the pledged claim and the pledgee's own claim.
- **A3**: The existence of a mechanism for collecting or depositing the pledged amount.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors into more specific base-level factors based on Article 366:
- Under **A1**, we have:
  - **B1**: If the subject matter is monies, the pledgee may collect it to the extent of their own claim.
  - **B2**: If the subject matter is not monies, the pledgee has a pledge over the thing received for satisfying the claim.
- Under **A2**, we have:
  - **B3**: The pledgee can have the third party obligor deposit the amount with an official depository if the due date of the pledged claim arrives before the due date of the pledgee's claim.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **A1 supports R1**: The nature of the subject matter affects how the pledge can be collected.
- **A2 supports R1**: The timing of due dates influences the method of collection or deposit.
- **A3 supports R1**: The mechanism for collecting or depositing is crucial for the pledgee's rights.
- **B1 supports A1**: Collecting monies specifically supports the abstract factor regarding the nature of the subject matter.
- **B2 supports A1**: Having a pledge over non-monetary items supports the same abstract factor.
- **B3 supports A2**: The specific scenario of depositing with an official depository supports the timing-related abstract factor.

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "The pledgee of claim X that is a nominative claim can directly collect claim X if the time of performance of the secured claim arrives along with the time of performance for the claim X that is the subject matter of the pledge."

- **(query entails B3)** because both consider scenarios where the timing of performances affects the collection or deposit process.
  
### Agreement with Root Node
Considering the most comparable root node, **R1**, which states a pledgee has the right to directly collect a pledged claim under certain conditions:
- The query essentially agrees with **R1** in that it outlines a specific scenario where direct collection is permissible based on the timing of performances.
  
Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After careful rejustification, the analysis holds as the query specifically aligns with the conditions and rights outlined for pledgees in Article 366, particularly concerning the timing of claim performances and the nature of the pledged claim.

correct prediction case 152
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then evaluate the given query against this framework, let's follow the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 364 seeks to establish that the creation of a pledge over a claim may not be duly asserted against a third party obligor unless notice is given or consent obtained. Therefore, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: The establishment of a pledge over a claim cannot be asserted against a third party obligor without proper notification or consent.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- **A1**: Notification to the obligor according to Article 467.
- **A2**: Consent from the obligor as per Article 467.
- **A3**: The use of an instrument bearing a certified date for notice or consent, especially when asserting against third parties other than the obligor.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining A3 into more specific conditions:
- **B1**: The necessity of using an instrument with a certified date when notifying third parties about the pledge.
- **B2**: The requirement for consent to be in a form that can be duly asserted against third parties, potentially implying the need for a certified date.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(A1 supports R1)**: Notification is crucial for asserting the pledge.
- **(A2 supports R1)**: Consent allows for the assertion of the pledge without notification.
- **(A3 supports R1)**: Proper documentation facilitates the assertion against third parties.
- **(B1 supports A3)**: Specifies how notice or consent should be made to be effective against all third parties.
- **(B2 supports A3)**: Highlights the importance of proper documentation for consent.

### Evaluating the Query
Given the query: "In cases where a nominative claim where the obligee is an individual is the subject matter of a pledge, to assert the establishment of the pledge against a third party other than the obligator of the claim that is a subject matter of the pledge, the notification or acknowledgement using an instrument bearing a fixed date is required."

- **(query entails B1)**: The query specifically mentions the necessity of using an instrument with a fixed (certified) date for notification or acknowledgment when dealing with third parties, which aligns with B1.
  
### Agreement with Root Node
Since **B1** supports **A3**, and **A3** in turn supports **R1**, the query indirectly supports **R1** by emphasizing a crucial aspect of asserting a pledge against third parties (the need for proper documentation). Therefore, the query agrees with the root node's verdict regarding the necessity of proper procedures (notification or consent) for asserting a pledge against third parties.

- **(query agree R1)**: The query aligns with the principle that establishing a pledge requires specific conditions to be met before it can be asserted against third parties, particularly emphasizing the documentation aspect. 

Upon reevaluation, this analysis remains consistent, highlighting the importance of proper notification or consent procedures in asserting pledges over claims, especially when involving third parties.

correct prediction case 153
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow the step-by-step approach.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 419 seeks to establish that the obligor is responsible for compensation for loss or damage due to failure to perform an obligation to deliver money, determined by the statutory interest rate, unless an agreed-upon interest rate applies, and without needing proof of loss or damage.

- **Root Node (R1):** The obligor bears responsibility for delay in performance of a monetary debt, leading to compensation for loss or damage based on statutory or agreed-upon interest rates.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
Key legal factors that substantiate or undermine the conclusion include:
- The application of statutory interest rates for determining compensation.
- The role of agreed-upon interest rates if they exceed statutory rates.
- The absence of a requirement to prove loss or damage.
- The non-applicability of force majeure as a defense against compensation claims.

- **Abstract Factor (A1):** Application of Interest Rates
- **Abstract Factor (A2):** Proof of Loss or Damage Not Required
- **Abstract Factor (A3):** Non-Applicability of Force Majeure

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For A1, we can refine it further:
- **Base-Level Factor (B1):** Statutory Interest Rate Applies
- **Base-Level Factor (B2):** Agreed-Upon Interest Rate Exceeds Statutory Rate and Applies

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **(B1 supports A1)**
- **(B2 supports A1)**
- **(A1 supports R1)**
- **(A2 supports R1)**
- **(A3 supports R1)**

Given the query: "If the obligor of a monetary debt cannot pay on the time of performance due to force majeure, the obligor of the monetary debt does not bear responsibility of delay in performance."

### Justification
The query directly relates to the concept of force majeure and its impact on the responsibility for delay in performance. This is addressed by **Abstract Factor (A3):** Non-Applicability of Force Majeure, which supports **Root Node (R1)**.

However, upon closer examination, it's clear that the query actually presents a scenario where force majeure would typically excuse a party from performing their obligations due to circumstances beyond their control. The article specifically states that "The obligor may not raise the defense of force majeure with respect to the compensation for loss or damage referred to in paragraph (1)," which implies that even if force majeure prevents payment, the obligor is still liable for the compensation as specified.

Thus, while the query suggests a scenario where force majeure might typically excuse performance, the legal provision indicates that such an excuse does not apply to the liability for compensation due to delay. This means the query **disagrees** with the implication of **Root Node (R1)** in this specific context because R1 implies responsibility for delay even when force majeure is involved, as per Article 419's stipulation against using force majeure as a defense for compensation claims.

Therefore:
- **(query entails B3, if we were to define B3 as "Force Majeure Prevents Payment")**, though this wasn't explicitly defined in our structure due to the focus on interest rates and proof of damage.
- **(query disagree R1)**, because while R1 suggests the obligor bears responsibility for delay (including compensation), the query's context (involving force majeure) might initially seem to contradict this by implying an exception. However, Article 419 does not allow force majeure as a defense against such compensation claims.

After re-justification, considering the specifics of how force majeure is treated in Article 419:
The conclusion stands that the query presents a scenario where force majeure might be considered relevant but notes that according to the article, force majeure does not excuse the liability for compensation due to delay. Thus, the disagreement lies in the interpretation of responsibility under conditions of force majeure as per the article's specific stipulations.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions and then analyze the given query in relation to this structure, we follow the step-by-step approach outlined.

### 1. Identify the Root Node (R)
The root node represents the main legal conclusion or verdict that the article seeks to establish or refute. Based on Article 457, the root node can be identified as:
- **R1**: A guarantor's rights and defenses in relation to the obligee are influenced by the principal obligor's situation.

### 2. Derive Abstract Factors (A)
These factors substantiate or undermine the legal conclusion. From Article 457, we derive:
- **A1**: Postponement of expiry of prescription period and renewal due to grounds such as a request for performance affect both the principal obligor and the guarantor.
- **A2**: The guarantor's ability to assert defenses that can be raised by the principal obligor against the obligee.
- **A3**: The impact of the principal obligor's rights (such as set-off, rescind, or cancel) on the guarantor's obligation to perform.

### 3. Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining abstract factors:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The guarantor benefits from any postponement of expiry or renewal of prescription periods that apply to the principal obligor.
- Under **A2**:
  - **B2**: The guarantor can assert against the obligee any defense available to the principal obligor.
- Under **A3**:
  - **B3**: If the principal obligor has a valid right to set-off, rescind, or cancel, the guarantor may refuse performance to the extent the principal obligor's obligation would be released.

### 4. Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Directed links are established as follows:
- **B1 supports A1**
- **B2 supports A2**
- **B3 supports A3**
- Each abstract factor supports the root node, so we have:
  - **A1 supports R1**
  - **A2 supports R1**
  - **A3 supports R1**

Given the query: "Until the principal obligor offsets with a possessed claim, the guarantor cannot raise a defense vis-a-vis the obligee by setting off any claim."
- This scenario specifically addresses the situation where the guarantor's ability to set off is contingent upon the principal obligor's action. Thus, it relates closely to **B3**, which discusses the guarantor's refusal to perform based on the principal obligor's rights.

**Justification**: 
- The query entails a base-level factor considering the evidence in a similar situation or scenario as **B3**, because both deal with the conditions under which a guarantor can refuse performance based on the principal obligor's rights. Thus, **(query entails B3)**.
- Comparing the query to the root node **R1**, we see that the query agrees with **R1** in the sense that it further specifies a condition (the principal obligor's offset) under which the guarantor's obligations are affected by the principal obligor's situation. Therefore, **(query agree R1)**.

After re-justification, considering the detailed analysis of how the query aligns with the base-level factor and the root node, we confirm that the initial justification is accurate. The query indeed entails a scenario similar to **B3** and agrees with the overall legal conclusion represented by **R1**.

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the structure based on the provided legal provisions and analyze the given query, we follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article seeks to establish that even if there are grounds for the invalidity or rescission of a juridical act with respect to one of the joint and several obligors, the validity of the obligation of other joint and several obligors is not impaired. Thus, the root node can be stated as:
- **R1**: The validity of an obligation of one jointly and severally liable party is not affected by the invalidity or rescission of the juridical act concerning another jointly and severally liable party.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate this conclusion include:
- **A1**: Grounds for invalidity or rescission of a juridical act.
- **A2**: Joint and several liability among obligors.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining the abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: Rescission of a contract due to one party being an adult ward.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: Joint borrowing among multiple parties.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- **B1** supports **A1** because being an adult ward can be a ground for rescission, which in turn supports the scenario where one party's invalidity does not affect others.
- **B2** supports **A2** as it directly pertains to joint and several liability.

Given these steps, we now analyze the query:
"In cases where, after jointly borrowing 1,000,000 yen from two money lenders one of the jointly and several obligors rescinds the contract for reasons that he or she is an adult ward, the other jointly and several obligors are revoked of the portion of the obligation of the adult ward."

### Justification
- The query entails **B1** because it considers a scenario where one party (an adult ward) rescinds the contract, which aligns with the base-level factor of rescission due to being an adult ward.
- The query disagrees with **R1** because it suggests that the other jointly and severally liable parties are revoked of the portion of the obligation of the adult ward. This implies that the validity of their obligations is affected by the invalidity or rescission concerning another party, contrary to what **R1** states.

Therefore:
- (query entails B1)
- (query disagree R1)

======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, let's follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The article discusses the effectiveness of performance made to a person who appears to be authorized to accept it but may not actually be. The outcome or legal conclusion it seeks to establish is: "Performance made to an unauthorized person is effective only if the performer was acting in good faith and without negligence."

Thus, the Root Node (R1) can be stated as: "Performance to an apparently authorized but actually unauthorized person is valid under certain conditions."

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion are:
- A1: The appearance of authority in light of common sense in the transaction.
- A2: The performer's good faith and lack of negligence.

These factors validate the conclusion under which conditions performance to an unauthorized person can be considered effective.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
For A1, we can refine it further:
- B1: The person effecting performance believed in good faith that the recipient was authorized based on common sense in transactions.
- B2: There was an objective appearance of authority (e.g., manifestations or actions by the obligee or third parties that would lead a reasonable person to believe the recipient was authorized).

For A2, we can also refine:
- B3: The performer had no knowledge of facts that would have led a reasonable person to question the recipient's authority.
- B4: The performer took reasonable steps to verify the recipient's authority before effecting performance.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
- (B1 supports A1) because believing in good faith supports the appearance of authority.
- (B2 supports A1) as objective appearances support the notion of apparent authority.
- (B3 supports A2) since lack of knowledge about potential issues with authority supports the performer's good faith.
- (B4 supports A2) because taking steps to verify authority demonstrates a lack of negligence.
- (A1 supports R1) since appearance of authority is crucial for the performance to be considered valid under certain conditions.
- (A2 supports R1) as the performer's good faith and lack of negligence are directly linked to the validity of the performance.

### Query Analysis
The query states: "A bearer of a receipt, regardless of the subjective conditions of the performer regarding that person's authority, is deemed to have the authority to accept performance."

This query entails base-level factor B2 because both consider scenarios where the appearance or objective manifestation of authority (in this case, being a bearer of a receipt) is sufficient for deeming someone authorized to accept performance, regardless of the performer's subjective beliefs.

### Agreement with Root Node
The query seems to disagree with R1. The root node specifies that performance to an apparently authorized person is valid only if the performer was acting in good faith and without negligence. In contrast, the query suggests that being a bearer of a receipt automatically deems someone as having authority, which does not explicitly address the conditions of good faith or lack of negligence on the part of the performer.

Therefore, given the output format requirements:
- (query entails B2)
- (query disagree R1)

correct prediction case 157
======== Angelic extraction step: ======== 
 To construct the ANGELIC structure based on the provided legal provisions, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Root Node (R)
The outcome of Article 460 seeks to establish when a guarantor may exercise in advance the right to reimbursement against the principal obligor. Thus, the root node can be defined as:
- **R1**: A guarantor may exercise the right to reimbursement against the principal obligor under specific conditions.

### Step 2: Derive Abstract Factors (A)
The key legal factors that substantiate or undermine this conclusion include:
- **A1**: The principal obligor's financial status and its impact on the guarantee.
- **A2**: The due date of the obligation and any extensions granted by the obligee.
- **A3**: Judicial decisions ordering the guarantor to perform the obligation.

### Step 3: Refine Abstract Factors into Base-Level Factors (B), if applicable
Refining these abstract factors, we get:
- Under **A1**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B1**: The principal obligor is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding.
- Under **A2**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B2**: The obligation is due, with no extension of time granted by the obligee to the principal obligor after the guarantee contract was concluded.
- Under **A3**, a base-level factor could be:
  - **B3**: A judicial decision orders the guarantor to perform the obligation without negligence on the guarantor's part.

### Step 4: Establish Directed Links (Support or Deny)
Each abstract factor supports the root node, and each base-level factor supports its respective abstract factor. Thus:
- **A1** supports **R1**
- **A2** supports **R1**
- **A3** supports **R1**
- **B1** supports **A1**
- **B2** supports **A2**
- **B3** supports **A3**

### Query Analysis
Given the query: "In cases where the claim whose period of extinctive prescription has passed is in a state of offset with and the opposing claim possessed by the obligor before the period has passed, the obligor that possess the claim whose period of extinctive prescription has passed can perform the offset regardless of whether the invocation of prescription is made before the period of extinctive prescription has passed or after."

This query does not directly relate to the conditions under which a guarantor may exercise the right to reimbursement against the principal obligor as outlined in Article 460. However, it touches on the concept of obligations and claims, which could be tangentially related to **A2** (the due date of the obligation and any extensions granted by the obligee) in terms of how obligations are managed and fulfilled.

Justifying whether the query entails base-level factors:
- The query does not directly entail any of the base-level factors (**B1**, **B2**, **B3**) as it discusses a different aspect of legal proceedings (offset of claims with passed extinctive prescription periods).

Justifying whether the query agrees or disagrees with the root node **R1**:
- The query and **R1** deal with different scenarios. **R1** concerns conditions for a guarantor's right to reimbursement, while the query discusses the offset of claims with regard to extinctive prescription periods. Therefore, there is no direct agreement or disagreement between the query and **R1**, as they address distinct legal situations.

Output:
- (query does not entail B1, B2, B3)
- Since the query deals with a different aspect of law, it neither directly agrees nor disagrees with **R1** on the specific conditions for a guarantor's right to reimbursement.
