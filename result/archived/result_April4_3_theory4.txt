(2) An act that is voidable on the grounds of a mistake, fraud or duress may be rescinded only by the person who made the defective manifestation of intention, or an agent or successor thereof.

article: Article 562 (1) If the subject matter delivered to the buyer does not conform to the terms of the contract with respect to the kind, quality or quantity, the buyer may demand that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance by repairing the subject matter, delivering the substitute or delivering the replenishment; provided, however, that the seller may cure the non-conformity of performance by a method that is different from the method demanded by the buyer if it does not impose any undue burden on the buyer.
Article 563 (1) In the case prescribed in the main clause of paragraph (1) of the preceding Article, if the buyer demands that the seller cure the non-conformity of performance by specifying a reasonable period of time but the non-conformity of performance is not cured within that period, the buyer may request a reduction of the price in proportion to the degree of non-conformity.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, in the following cases, a buyer in good faith may request a reduction of the price immediately without making demand referred to in that paragraph:
(i) if it is impossible to cure the non-conformity of performance;
(ii) if the seller unequivocally manifests the intention to refuse to cure the non-conformity of performance;
(iii) if, due to the nature of the contract or a manifestation of intention by the parties, the purpose of the contract is unable to be achieved unless the performance is carried out at a specific time on a specific date or within a certain period of time, and the seller fails to cure the non-conformity of the performance at the time or before the period expires; or
(iv) beyond the cases set forth in the preceding items, it is obvious that the seller is unlikely to cure the non-conformity of the performance even if the buyer makes the demand referred to in the preceding paragraph.
query: If the seller cannot transfer any part of the rights which are the subject matter of the sale because the part of the rights belong to others and it is impossible to cure the non-conformity of performance, the seller may immediately claim a reduction of the purchase money without demand.
