INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the following legal article or provision carefully.
2. Break down the text into four separate categories:
   - **Context(s)**. Identify who is the plaintiff and who is the defendant. Indicate the defendant’s action that gives rise to legal justification.
   - **Condition(s)** (the specific circumstances or triggers under which the rule applies). Outline the specific circumstances or triggers that cause the rule to apply. If multiple conditions can independently trigger the rule, list them separately. If the text uses “and,” combine those conditions within the same bullet. If the text uses “or,” place those conditions in separate bullets. If no keyword is present, assume they belong in the same bullet.
   - **Legal Consequence(s)** (the outcome or effect that arises once the conditions are met). State the outcome or effect when the listed conditions are met. Clearly describe the resulting effects on both defendant and plaintiff.
   - **Exception(s)** (any limitations or circumstances that negate or modify the rule or consequences)

IMPORTANT:
- Each category must remain distinct; do **not** include details that belong to another category.
  - For example, do not place condition statements in the “Rule” category, and do not place exceptions in the “Conditions” category.
- If something fits more than one category, choose the **most specific** category. 
- Present your final output in the exact structured format shown below.

**TEXT TO ANALYZE:**
Article 295 (2): "The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply if possession commenced by means of a tortious act."

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

**Rule(s)**:
The rule restricts the application of previous paragraphs under certain conditions.

**Condition(s)**:
• Condition 1: Possession commenced by means of a tortious act.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply.

**Exception(s)**:
Possession commenced by means of a tortious act is an exception to the general rule.

Now, let's analyze the query:

**Query:** A commenced possession of Building X, owned by B, while knowing there is no title, and thereafter A obtained a claim that has arisen in relation to X. In this case, A may retain X until that claim is satisfied.

**Plaintiff and Defendant:**
The plaintiff is B (the owner of Building X), and the defendant is A (who commenced possession of Building X).

**Conclusion on Defendant:**
A may retain X until the claim is satisfied.

**Query vs. Legal Consequence:**
(Query, Outcome, No) - The conclusion on the defendant in the query is opposite to the legal consequence stated in the article.

**Defendant meets Conditions:**
(Query, Condition 1, Yes) - A commenced possession of Building X by means of a tortious act (knowing there was no title).

**Exception for Defendant:**
(Query, Exception 1, Yes) - There is an exception because A's possession commenced by means of a tortious act.

**Justification of Query:**
Query(Exception, Yes)

 Let's analyze the given legal article and apply it to the query.

**Rule(s)**:
A guarantor is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation if they are aware of the principal obligor's limited capacity to act when entering into a guarantee contract.

**Condition(s)**:
• Condition 1: The guarantor guarantees an obligation that may be voidable due to the principal obligor's limited capacity to act.
• Condition 2: The guarantor is aware, at the time of entering into a guarantee contract, of the cause for its voidability.

**Legal Consequence(s)**:
The guarantor is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation of the same subject matter in the event of non-performance by the principal obligor or rescission of the obligation.

**Exception(s)**:
None mentioned in this article.

Now, let's apply this analysis to the query:

Query: In cases where the contract of guarantee between C and B is concluded with respect to monetary debt of A against B; in the case A is a minor and assumed the obligation against B without consent of the legal representative, C was aware, at the time of entering into a contract guarantee, of such fact, C shall be presumed to have assumed an independent obligation of the same subject in the event of rescission of the obligation of A.

1. Plaintiff: B; Defendant: C
Conclusion on defendant C: C is presumed to have assumed an independent obligation of the same subject matter.

2. (Query, Outcome, Yes)

3. (Query, Condition 1, Yes); (Query, Condition 2, Yes)

4. (Query, Exception 1, No) (Since there are no exceptions mentioned in this article.)

1. Read the following legal article or provision carefully.
2. Break down the text into four separate categories:
   - **Context(s)**. Identify who is the plaintiff and who is the defendant. Indicate the defendant’s action that gives rise to legal justification.
   - **Condition(s)** (the specific circumstances or triggers under which the rule applies). Outline the specific circumstances or triggers that cause the rule to apply. If multiple conditions can independently trigger the rule, list them separately. If the text uses “and,” combine those conditions within the same bullet. If the text uses “or,” place those conditions in separate bullets. If no keyword is present, assume they belong in the same bullet.
   - **Legal Consequence(s)** (the outcome or effect that arises once the conditions are met). State the outcome or effect when the listed conditions are met. Clearly describe the resulting effects on both defendant and plaintiff.
   - **Exception(s)** (any limitations or circumstances that negate or modify the rule or consequences)

IMPORTANT:
- Each category must remain distinct; do **not** include details that belong to another category.
  - For example, do not place condition statements in the “Rule” category, and do not place exceptions in the “Conditions” category.
- If something fits more than one category, choose the **most specific** category.

   - **Condition(s)** (the specific circumstances or triggers under which the rule applies). Outline the specific circumstances or triggers that cause the rule to apply. If multiple conditions can independently trigger the rule, list them separately. If the text uses “and,” combine those conditions within the same bullet. If the text uses “or,” place those conditions in separate bullets. If no keyword is present, assume they belong in the same bullet.
   - **Legal Consequence(s)** (the outcome or effect that arises once the conditions are met). State the outcome or effect when the listed conditions are met. Clearly describe the resulting effects on both defendant and plaintiff.
   - **Exception(s)** (any limitations or circumstances that negate or modify the rule or consequences)

IMPORTANT:
- Each category must remain distinct; do **not** include details that belong to another category.
  - For example, do not place condition statements in the “Rule” category, and do not place exceptions in the “Conditions” category.
- If something fits more than one category, choose the **most specific** category.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the following legal article or provision carefully.
2. Break down the text into four separate categories:
   - **Context(s)**. Identify who is the plaintiff and who is the defendant. Indicate the defendant’s action that gives rise to legal justification.
   - **Condition(s)** (the specific circumstances or triggers under which the rule applies). Outline the specific circumstances or triggers that cause the rule to apply. If multiple conditions can independently trigger the rule, list them separately. If the text uses “and,” combine those conditions within the same bullet. If the text uses “or,” place those conditions in separate bullets. If no keyword is present, assume they belong in the same bullet.
   - **Legal Consequence(s)** (the outcome or effect that arises once the conditions are met). State the outcome or effect when the listed conditions are met. Clearly describe the resulting effects on both defendant and plaintiff.
   - **Exception(s)** (any limitations or circumstances that negate or modify the rule or consequences)

IMPORTANT:
- Each category must remain distinct; do **not** include details that belong to another category.
  - For example, do not place condition statements in the “Rule” category, and do not place exceptions in the “Conditions” category.
- If something fits more than one category, choose the **most specific** category.

1. Read the following legal article or provision carefully.
2. Break down the text into four separate categories:
   - **Context(s)**. Identify who is the plaintiff and who is the defendant. Indicate the defendant’s action that gives rise to legal justification.
   - **Condition(s)** (the specific circumstances or triggers under which the rule applies). Outline the specific circumstances or triggers that cause the rule to apply. If multiple conditions can independently trigger the rule, list them separately. If the text uses “and,” combine those conditions within the same bullet. If the text uses “or,” place those conditions in separate bullets. If no keyword is present, assume they belong in the same bullet.
   - **Legal Consequence(s)** (the outcome or effect that arises once the conditions are met). State the outcome or effect when the listed conditions are met. Clearly describe the resulting effects on both defendant and plaintiff.
   - **Exception(s)** (any limitations or circumstances that negate or modify the rule or consequences)

IMPORTANT:
- Each category must remain distinct; do **not** include details that belong to another category.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the following legal article or provision carefully.
2. Break down the text into four separate categories:
   - **Context(s)**. Identify who is the plaintiff and who is the defendant. Indicate the defendant’s action that gives rise to legal justification.
   - **Condition(s)** (the specific circumstances or triggers under which the rule applies). Outline the specific circumstances or triggers that cause the rule to apply. If multiple conditions can independently trigger the rule, list them separately. If the text uses “and,” combine those conditions within the same bullet. If the text uses “or,” place those conditions in separate bullets. If no keyword is present, assume they belong in the same bullet.
   - **Legal Consequence(s)** (the outcome or effect that arises once the conditions are met). State the outcome or effect when the listed conditions are met. Clearly describe the resulting effects on both defendant and plaintiff.
   - **Exception(s)** (any limitations or circumstances that negate or modify the rule or consequences)

IMPORTANT:
- Each category must remain distinct; do **not** include details that belong to another category.
  - For example, do not place condition statements in the “Rule” category, and do not place exceptions in the “Conditions” category.
- If something fits more than one category, choose the **most specific** category.

article: Article 20
(1) After a person with qualified legal capacity who is involved in dealings with another party becomes a person with the legal capacity to act (meaning a person whose legal capacity to act is not subject to restrictions; the same applies hereinafter), the other party to those dealings may fix a period of one month or longer and demand that the person give a definite answer within that period of time as to whether the person will ratify an act that the person may rescind. In such a case, if the person fails to send a definite answer within that period of time, the person is deemed to have ratified that act.
(2) The second sentence of the preceding paragraph also applies if, before the person with qualified legal capacity becomes a person with the legal capacity to act, the other party to dealings involving the person with qualified legal capacity lodges the demand prescribed in the preceding paragraph with the legal representative, curator, or assistant of that person with respect to an act within the scope of their authority, and they fail to send a definite answer within the fixed period of time referred to in that paragraph.
(3) If a person does not send notice within the period of time set forth in the preceding two paragraphs indicating that the person has completed any special formalities that an act requires, the person is deemed to have rescinded that act.
(4) The other party to dealings involving a person with qualified legal capacity may lodge a demand with a person under curatorship or with a person under assistance who is subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1) to demand that the person get the curator or assistant to ratify an act within the fixed period referred to in paragraph (1). In such a case, if the person under curatorship or person under assistance does not send notice within that period indicating that the person has gotten the curator or assistant to ratify the act in question, the person is deemed to have rescinded that act.
Article 13
(1) A person under curatorship must obtain the consent of the curator in order to perform any of the following acts;provided, however, that this does not apply to an act provided for in the proviso of Article 9:
(i) receiving or using any property producing civil fruit;
(ii) borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation;
(iii) performing an act with the purpose of acquiring or losing any right regarding immovables or other significant property;
(iv) suing any procedural act;
(v) giving a gift, reaching a settlement, or entering into an arbitration agreement (meaning an arbitration agreement as provided in Article 2, paragraph (1) of the Arbitration Act (Act No. 138 of 2003));
(vi) accepting or renouncing a succession or dividing an estate;
(vii) refusing an offer of a gift, renouncing a legacy, accepting an offer of gift with burden, or accepting a legacy with burden;
(viii) constructing a new building, renovating, expanding, or undertaking major repairs;
(ix) granting a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602; or
(x) performing any of the acts set forth in the preceding items as a legal representative of a person with qualified legal capacity (meaning a minor, adult ward, or person under curatorship or a person under assistance who is subject to a decision as referred to in Article 17, paragraph (1); the same applies hereinafter).
(2) At the request of a person as referred to in the main clause of Article 11
or the curator or curator's supervisor, the family court may decide that the person under curatorship must also obtain the consent of the curator before performing an act other than those set forth in each of the items of the preceding paragraph;provided, however, that this does not apply to an act provided for in the proviso to Article 9.
(3) If the curator does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's consent at the request of the person under curatorship.
(4) An act for which the person under curatorship must obtain the curator's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it.
query: In cases where the person who has concluded the contract for sale with the person under curatorship issues to the curator of such person a notice which demands, by establishing a certain period which is one month or more, that he/she should give a definite answer on whether or not such person will ratify such act which may be rescinded within such period, if the curator fails to send any definite answer within such period, he/she is deemed to have ratified the contract for sale.

After that, identify the plaintiff and defendant of the given query. Answering following questions given that agurments structure, you can use information from previous questions to answer next:

1. Identify the Plaintiff and Defendant, what the conclusion on defedant of query?[You do not have to output any format here]
    
2. Is that defendant's conclusion in the query the same as or opposite to the legal consequence(outcome) stated in the article? Answer “Yes” if they are the same, and “No” if they are opposite. Output format example: (Query, Outcome, Yes) or (Query, Outcome, No)

3. Justify if the defendant in the query meet each condition in the Conditions section of articles. Answer "Yes" or "No" and specifies condition number. Output format example: (Query, Condition 1, Yes)

4. Does the defendant in the query have any exception from Exception section?: Answer "Yes" if there is any evidence indicating an exception; otherwise, "No". Output format example: (Query, Exception 1, No)

At the end, output the justification of query into format such as:

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the following legal article or provision carefully.
2. Break down the text into four separate categories:
   - **Context(s)**. Identify who is the plaintiff and who is the defendant. Indicate the defendant’s action that gives rise to legal justification.
   - **Condition(s)** (the specific circumstances or triggers under which the rule applies). Outline the specific circumstances or triggers that cause the rule to apply. If multiple conditions can independently trigger the rule, list them separately. If the text uses “and,” combine those conditions within the same bullet. If the text uses “or,” place those conditions in separate bullets. If no keyword is present, assume they belong in the same bullet.
   - **Legal Consequence(s)** (the outcome or effect that arises once the conditions are met). State the outcome or effect when the listed conditions are met. Clearly describe the resulting effects on both defendant and plaintiff.
   - **Exception(s)** (any limitations or circumstances that negate or modify the rule or consequences)

IMPORTANT:
- Each category must remain distinct; do **not** include details that belong to another category.
  - For example, do not place condition statements in the “Rule” category, and do not place exceptions in the “Conditions” category.
- If something fits more than one category, choose the **most specific** category.
